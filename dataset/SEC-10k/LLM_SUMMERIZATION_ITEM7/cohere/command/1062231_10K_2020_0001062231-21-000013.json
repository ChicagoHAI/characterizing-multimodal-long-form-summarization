Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nWe are a global Tier 1 supplier to the automotive industry. We design, engineer and manufacture driveline and metal forming products that are making the next generation of vehicles smarter, lighter, safer and more efficient. We employ approximately 20,000 associates, operating at nearly 80 facilities in 17 countries, to support our customers on global and regional platforms with a focus on operational excellence, quality and technology leadership.\nWe are a primary supplier of driveline components to General Motors Company (GM) for its full-size rear-wheel drive (RWD) light trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUV), and crossover vehicles manufactured in North America, supplying a significant portion of GM's rear axle and four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (4WD/AWD) axle requirements for these vehicle platforms. We also supply GM with various products from our Metal Forming segment. Sales to GM were approximately 39% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, 37% in 2019, and 41% in 2018.\nWe also supply driveline system products to FCA US LLC (FCA, now part of Stellantis N.V. effective January 2021) for programs including the heavy-duty Ram full-size pickup trucks and its derivatives, the AWD Chrysler Pacifica and the AWD Jeep Cherokee. In addition, we sell various products to FCA from our Metal Forming segment. Sales to FCA were approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, 17% in 2019 and 13% in 2018.\nWe are also a supplier to Ford Motor Company (Ford) for driveline system products on certain vehicle programs including the Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Lincoln Nautilus, and we sell various products to Ford from our Metal Forming segment. Sales to Ford were approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, 9% in of 2019 and 8% in 2018.\nIMPACT OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)\nCOVID-19 OPERATIONAL IMPACT AND AAM ACTIONS\nIn March of 2020, COVID-19 was designated by the World Health Organization as a pandemic illness and began to significantly disrupt global automotive production. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many governmental and public health agencies in locations in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. The majority of our customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production near the end of March, which continued into the second half of the second quarter. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period.\nAt AAM, safety is our top responsibility and that includes the health and wellness of our associates globally. In response to COVID-19, we instituted several operational measures to ensure the safety of our associates, which included the following:\n\u2022Assembled a COVID-19 Task Force comprised of AAM's senior leadership working closely with associates across several functions and regions to coordinate decision making and communication related to actions taken by AAM to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and to ensure that AAM is compliant with all region-specific regulations or requirements associated with COVID-19;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended or reduced production at manufacturing facilities and directed associates who could do so to work remotely;\n\u2022Maintained communication with customers, including planning for business resumption and monitoring announcements regarding new program deferrals or other changes;\n\u2022Initiated thorough cleaning and decontamination procedures at our facilities in preparation for resuming operations; and\n\u2022Designed additional safety measures to further protect associates as production was restored and our associates resumed working in certain of our global facilities.\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2020, our manufacturing locations in Asia, which were impacted by COVID-19 earlier than other global regions, began to stabilize and return to more normalized levels of production. We restarted operations in North America and Europe in May 2020, and we have continued to ramp up production, along with our customers and supply base, through the fourth quarter of 2020. Continuing to maintain more normalized levels of production will depend on future developments, including the potential extension of shelter-in-place orders and increased levels of production by our customers, which are outside of our control. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers, as well as on our customers and their suppliers.\nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19\nWe estimate that the impact of COVID-19 on net sales was approximately $1,243 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the impact to gross profit of this reduction in net sales was approximately $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the extent of the impact of COVID-19, including the possibility of resurgences of COVID-19 cases and our ability to sustain more normalized levels of production, we cannot estimate any potential future impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have continued our emphasis on cost management, and have implemented additional measures to adjust to our customers' revised production schedules, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and similar global initiatives.\nThe measures we are taking to address the impact of COVID-19 are expected to remain in place until further clarity can be achieved regarding the recovery and stabilization of the global economy, as well as the resulting impact of COVID-19 on the global automotive industry. We expect to adjust our use of these measures, to the extent possible, based on production volumes and customer demand.\nMANUFACTURING FACILITY FIRE\nOn September 22, 2020, a significant industrial fire occurred at our Malvern Manufacturing Facility in Ohio (Malvern Fire). All associates were evacuated safely and without injury. We continue to focus on managing this disruption and protecting continuity of supply to our customers, including utilizing production capacity and resources at other AAM facilities. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nThere are a number of significant trends affecting the markets in which we compete. Intense competition, volatility in the price of raw materials, including steel, other metallic materials, and resources used in vehicle electrification and electronic components, and significant pricing pressures remain. At the same time, there is a focus on investing in future products that will incorporate the latest technology and meet changing customer demands as certain original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) place increased emphasis on the development of battery and hybrid electric vehicles. The continued advancement of technology and product innovation, as well as the capability to source programs on a global basis, are critical to attracting and retaining business in our global markets.\nINCREASE IN DEMAND FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND ELECTRONIC INTEGRATION The electrification of vehicles continues to expand, driven by a shift in focus by certain OEMs toward battery and hybrid electric vehicles, government regulations related to emissions, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and consumer demand for greater vehicle performance, enhanced functionality, increased electronic content and vehicle connectivity, and affordable convenience options. We are responding, in part, through the development of our hybrid and electric driveline systems, and related subsystems and components, which allow us to meet our customers' needs for high performance vehicles with improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. We recently entered into a technology development agreement with Suzhou Inovance Automotive Ltd., a leading provider of automotive power electronics and powertrain systems in China, to accelerate the development and delivery of scalable, next-generation 3-in-1 electric drive systems, which integrate an inverter, electric motor and gearbox. To date, our hybrid and electric driveline systems have been awarded multiple contracts and received multiple awards.\nAs vehicle electrification and electronic components become an increasingly larger focus for OEMs and suppliers, the industry will likely continue to see the addition of new market entrants from non-traditional automotive companies, including increased competition from technology companies. Further, some traditional automotive industry participants are developing strategic partnerships with technology companies as each party seeks to leverage the existing customer relationships and technical knowledge of the partner, and expedite the development and commercialization of this new technology. An area of focus will be the product development cycle and bridging the gap between the shorter development cycles of information technology (IT) software and controls and the longer development cycles of traditional powertrain components. Our hybrid and electric driveline systems, EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, VecTrac\u2122 Torque Vectoring Technology and TracRite\u00ae Differential Technology, are examples of AAM's enhanced capabilities in supporting vehicle electrification and electronic integration.\nINCREASED DEMAND FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS There has been an increased demand for technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. As a result, OEMs and suppliers are competing to develop and market new and alternative technologies, such as electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells, higher speed transmissions, and downsized, fuel-efficient engines. At the same time, OEMs and suppliers are improving products to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions through lightweighting and efficiency initiatives.\nWe are responding with ongoing research and development (R&D) activities that focus on fuel economy, emissions reductions and environmental improvements by integrating electronics and technology. Through the development of our EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, hybrid and electric driveline systems, QuantumTM lightweight axle technology, high-efficiency axles, PowerLite\u00ae axles and PowerDense\u00ae gears, high strength connecting rod technology, refined vibration control systems, and forged axle tubes, we have significantly advanced our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, safety, and ride and handling performance while reducing emissions and mass. These efforts have led to new business awards and further position us to compete in the global marketplace.\nIn addition to AAM's organic growth in technology and processes, our acquisitions of Metaldyne Performance Group, Inc. (MPG) and certain operations of Mitec Automotive AG (Mitec), as well as our investment in our Liuzhou AAM joint venture, have provided us with complementary technologies, expanded our product portfolio, significantly diversified our global customer base, and strengthened our long-term financial profile through greater scale. The synergies achieved through our strategic initiatives have enhanced AAM's ability to compete in today's technological and regulatory environment, while remaining cost competitive through increased scale and integration.\nSHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE AND OEM PRODUCTION TO LIGHT TRUCK, CROSS-OVER VEHICLES (CUVs) AND SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLES (SUVs) There has been a trend toward increased demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs in certain markets, while demand for passenger cars has decreased. This increase in demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs has been driven by changes in consumer preference as technology advancements have made these vehicles lighter and more efficient, while the stabilizing cost of fuel has made owning these vehicles more affordable.\nCertain OEMs are responding to this change in consumer preference by shifting their focus to developing and manufacturing these types of vehicles, resulting in a significant reduction of passenger car vehicle programs, especially in North America. We have benefited from this trend as a significant portion of our business supports light truck, CUV and SUV programs in North America.\nGLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION As countries around the world continue to increase in importance to the automotive industry, our customers continue to design their products to meet demand in global markets and therefore require global support from their suppliers. For this reason, it is critical that suppliers maintain a global presence in these markets in order to compete for new contracts. We have business and engineering offices around the world to support our global locations and provide technical solutions to our customers on a regional basis, including in China and Europe where consumer acceptance of electric vehicles has been strong.\nThe cyclical nature of the automotive industry, volatile commodity prices, the shifting demands of consumer preference, regulatory requirements and trade agreements require OEMs and suppliers to remain agile with regard to product development and global capability. A critical objective for OEMs and suppliers is the ability to meet these global demands while effectively managing costs. Some OEMs and suppliers may be preparing for these challenges through merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, including potential increased M&A activity as a result of the recent economic impact of COVID-19, development of strategic partnerships and reduction of vehicle platform complexity. In order to effectively drive technology development, recognize cost synergies, and increase global footprint, the industry may continue to see consolidation in the supply base as companies recognize and respond to the need for scalability.\nEVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AS DEMAND FOR CAR-SHARING, RIDE-SHARING AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES INCREASES In addition to selling vehicles, OEMs are increasingly focused on offering their own car-sharing rental businesses and ride-sharing services. Car-sharing typically allows consumers to rent a car for a short period of time, while ride-sharing matches people to available carpools or other services that provide on-demand mobility. With population growth, increased government regulations to ease congestion and generational shifts in preferences, it is expected that the markets for these services will continue to grow, which could cause a change in the type of vehicles utilized. However, the growth in this area may also be temporarily curtailed by the impact of COVID-19, as social distancing recommendations have led to reduced utilization of ride-sharing services by consumers.\nAnother trend developing is the expectation that autonomous, self-driving cars will become more common with continued advancements in technology. Autonomous vehicles present many possible benefits, such as a reduction in traffic collisions caused by human error and reduced traffic congestion, but there are also foreseeable challenges such as liability for damage and software safety and reliability. The increased integration of electronics and vehicle connectivity that will likely be required in autonomous vehicle developments will provide an opportunity for suppliers, such as AAM, with advanced capabilities in this area to be competitive in this expanding market.\nThe discussion of our Results of Operations, Reportable Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for 2019, as compared to 2018, can be found within \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 14, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the sale of the United States (U.S.) operations of our Casting segment (the Casting Sale). The Casting Sale did not include the entities that conduct AAM's casting operations in El Carmen, Mexico, which are now included in our Driveline segment. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNET SALES Net sales were $4,710.8 million in 2020 as compared to $6,530.9 million in 2019. Our change in sales in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,243 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $628 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Net sales for 2020, as compared to 2019, also decreased by approximately $81 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect an estimated $243 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold was $4,128.1 million in 2020 as compared to $5,628.3 million in 2019. The change in cost of goods sold in 2020, as compared to 2019, principally reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $875 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $607 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Cost of goods sold was also impacted by a decrease of approximately $81 million related to metal market pass-through costs and the impact of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of improved operating performance and lower launch costs and our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19. These reductions in cost of goods sold were partially offset as 2019 cost of goods sold reflects an estimated $159 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage and there was no such impact in 2020.\nAs a result of the Malvern Fire, we recorded $63.5 million of expenses and recorded an estimated insurance recovery receivable of $54.2 million, which resulted in a net impact to Cost of goods sold of $9.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which includes our applicable deductible. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nMaterials costs as a percentage of total cost of goods sold were approximately 55% in 2020 and 56% in 2019.\nGROSS PROFIT Gross profit was $582.7 million in 2020 as compared to $902.6 million in 2019. Gross margin was 12.4% in 2020 as compared to 13.8% in 2019. Gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the factors discussed in Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold above. While we were able to significantly reduce our variable costs during 2020, the sharp decline in sales that began during the first quarter and extended into the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID-19, as well as the magnitude of the decline in sales, resulted in a reduction of both gross profit and gross margin.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) SG&A (including R&D) was $313.9 million in 2020 as compared to $364.7 million in 2019. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 6.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2019. R&D spending was $117.4 million in 2020 as compared to $144.7 million in 2019. The change in SG&A in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to lower net R&D expense, which includes a customer engineering, design and development (ED&D) recovery of approximately $15 million. The decrease in SG&A also reflects lower compensation-related expense due, in part, to our restructuring initiatives and the impact of our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nThe increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales during 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to the decline in sales as a result of COVID-19.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $86.6 million as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reduction in amortization expense related to intangible assets reflects the Casting Sale and the disposal of the intangible assets associated with this business.\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES In the first quarter of 2020, the reduction in global automotive production volumes caused by the impact of COVID-19 represented an indicator to test our goodwill for impairment. As a result of this goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying values of our Driveline and Metal Forming reporting units were greater than their respective fair values. As such, we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $510.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further detail.\nAs a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that the carrying value of our Metal Forming segment was greater than its fair value. As such, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $440.0 million in 2019 associated with this segment.\nIn conjunction with the Casting Sale, the assets and liabilities associated with this business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale. Upon reclassification to held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $225.0 million to reduce the carrying value of this business to fair value less cost to sell.\nRESTRUCTURING AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $67.2 million in 2020 and $57.8 million in 2019. As part of our restructuring actions, we incurred severance charges of approximately $22.3 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $36.1 million during 2020. In 2019, we incurred severance charges of approximately $19.4 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $20.4 million. We expect to incur approximately $50 million to $65 million of total restructuring costs in 2021.\nIntegration charges of $8.8 million were incurred in 2020 as we furthered the integration of global enterprise planning (ERP) systems at legacy MPG locations. This compares to acquisition-related costs and integration charges of $18.0 million in 2019. We expect to incur additional integration charges of approximately $5 million in 2021 as we finalize the integration of ERP systems at legacy MPG locations. See Note 2 - Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs for further detail.\nLOSS (GAIN) ON SALE OF BUSINESS In December 2019, we completed the Casting Sale and recorded a loss on sale of business of $21.3 million. During 2020, we finalized certain customary post-closing calculations associated with the Casting Sale, resulting in an additional loss on sale of $1.0 million. These losses are presented in the Loss (gain) on sale of business line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 16 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for further detail.\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Operating loss was $396.0 million in 2020 as compared to operating loss of $301.6 million in 2019. Operating margin was (8.4)% in 2020 as compared to (4.6)% in 2019. The changes in operating income (loss) and operating margin in 2020, as compared to 2019, were due to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, SG&A, Amortization of Intangible Assets, Impairment Charges, Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs and Loss (Gain) on Sale of Business above.\nINTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense was $212.3 million in 2020 and $217.3 million in 2019. The weighted-average interest rate of our total debt outstanding was 5.6% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2019. We expect our interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $200 million to $210 million.\nINTEREST INCOME Interest income was $11.6 million in 2020 and $5.8 million in 2019. Interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, realized and unrealized gains and losses on our short-term investments during the period, and the impact of the interest rate differential on our fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Following are the components of Other Income (Expense) for 2020 and 2019:\nDebt refinancing and redemption costs In December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.2 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the life of these borrowings.\nAlso in 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million and the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.7 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $5.0 million for the payment of early redemption premiums.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest. We expensed approximately $1.0 million for the write-off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing.\nIn July 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment). The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. We expensed $5.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Term Loan B Facility that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowings.\nIn May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100 million and $0.3 million in accrued interest. We also expensed approximately $0.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nGain on bargain purchase of a business In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of certain operations of Mitec, under which we acquired $20.2 million of net assets for a purchase price of $9.4 million, which was funded entirely with available cash. We recognized a gain on bargain purchase of $10.8 million associated with this acquisition.\nPension settlement charges In 2020, our restructuring activities resulted in the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses under our pension plans totaling $0.5 million. In 2019, we offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. pension plans that, if accepted, settled our pension obligations to them. This resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses.\nOther, net Other, net, which includes the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses, our proportionate share of earnings from equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than service costs and certain settlement charges, was expense of $5.2 million in 2020, compared to expense of $12.5 million in 2019. The decreased expense in other, net in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of approximately $6 million of lower net foreign currency remeasurement losses.\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT Income tax was a benefit of $49.2 million in 2020, as compared to a benefit of $48.9 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate was 8.1% in 2020 as compared to 9.2% in 2019.\nIn 2020, our effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as favorable foreign tax rates, the impact of tax credits, and the finalization of an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million. We also recognized a tax benefit of approximately $14.4 million related to our ability to carry back prior year losses, as well as projected current year losses, under the CARES Act to years with the previous 35% tax rate. These income tax benefits were partially offset by our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions, as well as a partial valuation allowance of approximately $5.3 million on certain U.S. federal income tax attributes.\nIn 2019, our income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as the incremental tax expense associated with the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Act), and our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These items were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign tax rates and income tax credits. In addition, as part of the 2017 Act, a one-time transition tax (Transition Tax) was imposed on certain foreign earnings for which U.S. income tax was previously deferred. The Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on February 5, 2019 regarding the Transition Tax, which changed the manner in which we are required to compute the Transition Tax when it is recognized over a two-year period. The application of the final regulations resulted in a $9.3 million income tax benefit, which was recorded in 2019, the period in which the final regulations were issued.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the extent and ultimate impact of COVID-19 on global automotive production volumes, we may experience lower than projected earnings in certain jurisdictions in future periods, and it is reasonably possible that changes in valuation allowances could be recognized in the next twelve months as a result.\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AAM AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) Net loss attributable to AAM was $561.3 million in 2020 as compared to $484.5 million in 2019. Diluted loss per share was $4.96 in 2020 as compared to a diluted loss of $4.31 per share in 2019. Net Loss and EPS were primarily impacted by the factors discussed above.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nOur business is organized into Driveline and Metal Forming segments, with each representing a reportable segment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 - Segment Reporting. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the Casting Sale. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, we continue to present Casting as a segment in the tables below, which is comprised entirely of the U.S. casting operations that were included in the sale.\nThe results of each segment are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of the segment and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\nOur product offerings by segment are as follows:\n\u2022Driveline products consist primarily of front and rear axles, driveshafts, differential assemblies, clutch modules, balance shaft systems, disconnecting driveline technology, and electric and hybrid driveline products and systems for light trucks, SUVs, CUVs, passenger cars and commercial vehicles; and\n\u2022Metal Forming products consist primarily of axle and transmission shafts, ring and pinion gears, differential gears and assemblies, connecting rods and variable valve timing products for OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.\nThe following tables outline our sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,037 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $974 million related to external customers. The change in Driveline sales also reflects a reduction of approximately $41 million, associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect a reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nThe change in net sales in our Metal Forming segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $380 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $269 million related to external customers. Also for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, Metal Forming sales were impacted by a reduction of approximately $40 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments.\nThe change in net sales in our Casting segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, is the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nWe use Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of earnings to assess the performance of each segment and determine the resources to be allocated to the segments. We define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA for our reportable segments excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Driveline segment was primarily attributable to lower net global automotive production volumes as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance and lower launch costs, as well as the impact of a customer ED&D recovery of approximately $15 million. The change in Driveline Segment Adjusted EBITDA also reflects the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Metal Forming Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance, as well as the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for our Casting segment was the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP and GAAP Information\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) in this MD&A, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules below.\nWe define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items. We believe that EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze operating performance and entity valuation. Our management, the investment community and the banking institutions routinely use EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA, together with other measures, to measure our operating performance relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to assess the relative mix of Adjusted EBITDA by segment. We also believe that Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is used for operational planning and decision-making purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(561.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(484.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>212.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit </td> <td>(49.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>521.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>536.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and acquisition-related costs </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt refinancing and redemption costs </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of business </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>510.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlements </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurring items: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Malvern Fire charges, net of recoveries </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on bargain purchase of business </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-recurring items </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>719.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>970.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund debt service obligations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, in addition to advancing our strategic initiatives. We believe that operating cash flow, available cash and cash equivalent balances and available committed borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet these needs.\nCOVID-19 Considerations Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have implemented measures to conserve cash and protect our liquidity position, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the CARES Act and similar global initiatives.\nAt December 31, 2020 we had approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity consisting of $557 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $891 million of available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $73 million of available borrowings under foreign credit facilities. We have no significant debt maturities before 2024. Based on our cash and cash equivalents, together with available borrowings under credit facilities, and the measures we are taking to conserve cash, we believe that our current liquidity position and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our primary cash needs for the next 12 months.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities was $454.7 million in 2020 as compared to $559.6 million in 2019. The following factors impacted cash provided by operating activities:\nImpact of COVID-19 We experienced lower earnings and cash flows from operating activities as a result of the significant reduction in production volumes during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nAccounts receivable We experienced a decrease in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $35 million related to the change in our accounts receivable balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in accounts receivable from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was primarily attributable to the timing of payments from customers, partially offset by a slight increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses We experienced an increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $61 million related to the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in balance from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of working capital initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable as a result of the timing of payments to suppliers.\nIncome taxes Income taxes paid, net was $2.1 million in 2020, as compared to $57.1 million in 2019. During 2020, we received an income tax refund of approximately $31 million related to the utilization of net operating losses under the provisions of the CARES Act and an income tax refund of approximately $11 million related to prior alternative minimum tax credits. See Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional detail regarding the CARES Act.\nAlso in 2020, we finalized an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a cash payment to the tax authorities of $18.5 million, and a reduction of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $25.3 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we have recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $22.2 million and $52.6 million, respectively.\nRestructuring and acquisition-related costs We incurred $67.2 million and $57.8 million of charges related to restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a significant portion of these charges were cash charges. In 2021, we expect restructuring and acquisition-related payments to be between $50 million and $65 million for the full year.\nPension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) Our cash payments for OPEB, net of GM cost sharing, were $12.5 million in 2020 and $15.5 million in 2019. This compares to our annual postretirement cost of $10.1 million in 2020 and $11.7 million in 2019. We expect our cash payments for OPEB obligations in 2021, net of GM cost sharing, to be approximately $17 million.\nDue to the availability of our pre-funded pension balances (previous contributions in excess of prior required pension contributions), we expect our regulatory pension funding requirements in 2021 to be less than $1.0 million.\nInterest paid Interest paid in 2020 was $192.4 million as compared to $205.4 million in 2019.\nMalvern Fire In 2020, we received $11.1 million of cash as an advance under our insurance policies associated with expenses incurred as a result of the Malvern Fire. At December 31, 2020, we have an insurance recovery receivable of $43.1 million, which is included in Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $218.4 million as compared to $306.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Capital expenditures were $215.6 million in 2020 and $433.3 million in 2019. We expect our capital spending in 2021 to be approximately 4.5% of sales, which includes support for our global program launches in 2021 and 2022 within our new and incremental business backlog, as well as program capacity increases and future launches of replacement programs.\nAs a result of the Casting Sale completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $141.2 million. Also in 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mitec for approximately $9 million, and made payments totaling approximately $9 million as part of our investment in the Liuzhou AAM joint venture.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in financing activities was $214.5 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $200.0 million in 2019. Total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,455.0 million at year-end 2020 and $3,641.0 million at year-end 2019. The change in total debt outstanding, net of issuance costs, at year-end 2020, as compared to year-end 2019, was primarily due to the factors noted below.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities In 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the prior Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. This also satisfies all payment requirements under the Term Loan B Facility until maturity in 2024.\nIn April 2020, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (Second Amendment). For the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (the Amendment Period), the Second Amendment, among other things, replaced the total net leverage ratio covenant with a new senior secured net leverage ratio covenant, reduced the minimum levels of the cash interest expense coverage ratio covenant, and modified certain covenants restricting the ability of Holdings, AAM and certain subsidiaries of Holdings to create, incur, assume or permit to exist certain additional indebtedness and liens and to make certain restricted payments, voluntary payments and distributions. The Second Amendment also increased the maximum levels of the total net leverage ratio covenant after the Amendment Period, modified the applicable\nmargin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility, and increased the minimum adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for Eurodollar-based loans under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for the Term Loan B Facility remains unchanged. We paid debt issuance costs of $4.6 million in 2020 related to the Second Amendment.\nIn December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, $891.2 million was available under the Revolving Credit Facility. This availability reflects a reduction of $33.8 million for standby letters of credit issued against the facility. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide back-up liquidity for our foreign credit facilities. We intend to use the availability of long-term financing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to refinance any current maturities related to such debt agreements that are not otherwise refinanced on a long-term basis in their local markets, except where otherwise reclassified to Current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n6.875% Notes due 2028 In June 2020, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2028 (the 6.875% Notes). Proceeds from the 6.875% Notes were used primarily to fund the redemption of the remaining $350 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2022 described below and for general corporate purposes. We paid debt issuance costs of $6.4 million in 2020 related to the 6.875% Notes.\nRedemption of 6.625% Notes Due 2022 In 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million, as well as the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest and approximately $5.0 million for early redemption premiums.\nRedemption of 7.75% Notes Due 2019 In May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100.0 million, as well as $0.3 million in accrued interest and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nForeign Credit Facilities We utilize local currency credit facilities to finance the operations of certain foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, $88.8 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $72.8 million was available, as compared to December 31, 2019, when $106.0 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $89.1 million was available.\nTreasury stock Treasury stock increased by $2.7 million in 2020 to $212.0 million as compared to $209.3 million at year-end 2019, due to the withholding and repurchase of shares of AAM stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of performance shares and restricted stock units.\nCredit ratings To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors.

Typically, our business is moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (normally 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Our major OEM customers also occasionally have longer shutdowns of operations (up to 6 weeks) for program changeovers. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of legal proceedings and the effect on AAM.\nEFFECT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for discussion of new accounting standards and the effect on AAM.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn order to prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.\nOther items in our consolidated financial statements require estimation. In our judgment, they are not as critical as those disclosed below. We have discussed and reviewed our critical accounting estimates disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nGOODWILL We record goodwill when the purchase price of acquired businesses exceeds the value of their identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles that are not amortized. We review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. In addition, we review goodwill for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nThis review is performed at the reporting unit level, and involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess carrying value over fair value.\nIn performing goodwill impairment testing, we utilize a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of each reporting unit. These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, market comparables, future cash flows of the reporting units, and appropriate discount and long-term growth rates. A decline in the actual cash flows of our reporting units in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in our valuations, could result in the carrying value of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Further, a change in market comparables, discount rate or long-term growth rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values.\nOur business is organized into two segments: Driveline and Metal Forming. Under the goodwill guidance, we determined that each of our segments represented a reporting unit. The determination of our reporting units and impairment indicators also require us to make significant judgments. See Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further detail regarding our goodwill impairment analyses for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Recoverability of each held for use\u201d asset group affected by impairment indicators is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows and is therefore not recoverable, the assets in this group are written down to their estimated fair value. We estimate fair value based on market prices, when available, or on a discounted cash flow analysis. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include:\n\u2022An assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review;\n\u2022Determination of asset groups, the primary asset within each group, and the primary asset's average estimated useful life;\n\u2022Undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets; and\n\u2022Determination of fair value when an impairment is deemed to exist, which may require assumptions related to future general economic conditions, future expected production volumes, product pricing and cost estimates, working capital and capital investment requirements, discount rates and estimated liquidation values.\nSee Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 16 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for further detail regarding our assessment of impairment of long-lived assets.\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS In calculating our assets, liabilities and expenses related to pension and OPEB, key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality projections and rates of increase in health care costs.\nThe discount rates used in the valuation of our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations were based on an actuarial review of a hypothetical portfolio of long-term, high quality corporate bonds matched against the expected payment stream for each of our plans. In 2020, the weighted-average discount rates determined on that basis were 2.50% for the valuation of our pension benefit obligations and 2.55% for the valuation of our OPEB obligations. The discount rate used in the valuation of our United Kingdom (U.K.) pension obligations were based on hypothetical yield curves developed from corporate bond yield information within each regional market. In 2020, the weighted-average discount rates determined on that basis were 1.55% for our U.K. plans. The expected weighted-average long-term rates of return on our plan assets were 7.25% for our U.S. plans, and 4.00% for our U.K. plans in 2020.\nWe developed these rates of return assumptions based on future capital market expectations for the asset classes represented within our portfolio and a review of long-term historical returns. The asset allocation for our plans was developed in consideration of the demographics of the plan participants and expected payment stream of the liability. Our investment policy allocates approximately 25% - 40% of the U.S. plans' assets to equity securities, depending on the plan, with the remainder invested in fixed income securities, hedge fund investments and cash. The rates of increase in health care costs are based on current market conditions, inflationary expectations and historical information.\nAll of our assumptions were developed in consultation with our actuarial service providers. While we believe that we have selected reasonable assumptions for the valuation of our pension and OPEB obligations at year-end 2020, actual trends could result in materially different valuations.\nThe effect on our pension plans of a 0.5% decrease in both the discount rate and expected return on assets is shown below as of December 31, 2020, our valuation date.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Discount </td> <td> </td> <td>Return on </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Assets </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decline in funded status </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(56.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in 2020 expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo changes in benefit levels or in the amortization of gains or losses have been assumed.\nFor 2021, we assumed a weighted-average annual increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits of 6.25% for OPEB. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by 2026 and remain at that level thereafter. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate for our OPEB would have decreased total expense in 2020 and increased the postretirement obligation, net of GM cost sharing, at December 31, 2020 by $0.7 million and $21.6 million, respectively. A 1.0% increase in the assumed health care trend rate would have increased total service and interest cost in 2020 and the postretirement obligation, net of GM cost sharing, at December 31, 2020 by $1.1 million and $37.0 million, respectively.\nAAM and GM share in the cost of OPEB for eligible retirees proportionally based on the length of service an employee had with AAM and GM. We estimate the future cost sharing payments and present it as an asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated $250.0 million in future GM cost sharing. If, in the future, GM were unable to fulfill this financial obligation, our OPEB obligations could be different than our current estimates.\nPRODUCT WARRANTY We record a liability and related charge to cost of goods sold for estimated warranty obligations at the dates our products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified. Product warranties not expected to be paid within one year are recorded as a noncurrent liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our estimated warranty obligations for products sold are based on significant management estimates, with input from our warranty, sales, engineering, quality and legal departments. For products and customers with actual warranty payment experience, we estimate warranty costs principally based on past claims history. For certain products and customers, actual warranty payment experience does not exist or is not mature. In these cases, we estimate our costs based on the contractual arrangements with our customers, existing customers' warranty program terms and internal and external warranty data, which includes a determination of our responsibility for potential warranty issues or claims and estimates of repair costs. We actively study trends of our warranty claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We continuously evaluate these estimates and our customers' administration of their warranty programs. We closely monitor actual warranty claim data and adjust the liability, as necessary, on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with our customers, we may be responsible for certain costs associated with product recalls and field actions, which are recorded at the time our obligation is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nOur warranty accrual was $66.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and $62.0 million as of December 31, 2019. During 2020 and 2019, we made adjustments to our warranty accrual to reflect revised estimates regarding our projected future warranty obligations. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. It is possible that changes in our assumptions or future warranty issues could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES Because we operate in many different geographic locations, including several foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions, the evaluation of our ability to use all recognized deferred tax assets is complex. In accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes, we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of deferred tax assets and estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not,\u201d based on forecasts of taxable income in the related tax jurisdictions. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carry forward periods, and tax planning opportunities are considered, along with other relevant positive and negative evidence. If, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have a valuation allowance of approximately $208.0 million related to net deferred tax assets in several foreign jurisdictions and U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance was $196.0 million and $183.3 million, respectively.\nIf, in the future, we generate taxable income on a sustained basis in foreign and U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions for which we have recorded valuation allowances, our current estimate of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could change and result in the future reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance. While we believe we have made appropriate valuations of our deferred tax assets, unforeseen changes in tax legislation, regulatory activities, audit results, operating results, financing strategies, organization structure and other related matters may result in material changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowances or our tax liabilities.\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby: (1) we determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position: and (2) for those positions that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in income tax expense (benefit).As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $22.2 million and $52.6 million, respectively. Based on the status of ongoing tax audits, and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, it is not possible to estimate the impact of changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. We will continue to monitor the progress and conclusions of all ongoing audits and other communications with tax authorities and will adjust our estimated liability as necessary.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Forward-Looking Statements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn this MD&A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K (Annual Report), we make statements concerning our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and future events or performance.

Sales to Ford were approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, 9% in of 2019 and 8% in 2018.\nIMPACT OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)\nCOVID-19 OPERATIONAL IMPACT AND AAM ACTIONS\nIn March of 2020, COVID-19 was designated by the World Health Organization as a pandemic illness and began to significantly disrupt global automotive production. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many governmental and public health agencies in locations in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. The majority of our customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production near the end of March, which continued into the second half of the second quarter. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period.\nAt AAM, safety is our top responsibility and that includes the health and wellness of our associates globally. In response to COVID-19, we instituted several operational measures to ensure the safety of our associates, which included the following:\n\u2022Assembled a COVID-19 Task Force comprised of AAM's senior leadership working closely with associates across several functions and regions to coordinate decision making and communication related to actions taken by AAM to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and to ensure that AAM is compliant with all region-specific regulations or requirements associated with COVID-19;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended or reduced production at manufacturing facilities and directed associates who could do so to work remotely;\n\u2022Maintained communication with customers, including planning for business resumption and monitoring announcements regarding new program deferrals or other changes;\n\u2022Initiated thorough cleaning and decontamination procedures at our facilities in preparation for resuming operations; and\n\u2022Designed additional safety measures to further protect associates as production was restored and our associates resumed working in certain of our global facilities.\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2020, our manufacturing locations in Asia, which were impacted by COVID-19 earlier than other global regions, began to stabilize and return to more normalized levels of production. We restarted operations in North America and Europe in May 2020, and we have continued to ramp up production, along with our customers and supply base, through the fourth quarter of 2020. Continuing to maintain more normalized levels of production will depend on future developments, including the potential extension of shelter-in-place orders and increased levels of production by our customers, which are outside of our control. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers, as well as on our customers and their suppliers.\nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19\nWe estimate that the impact of COVID-19 on net sales was approximately $1,243 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the impact to gross profit of this reduction in net sales was approximately $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the extent of the impact of COVID-19, including the possibility of resurgences of COVID-19 cases and our ability to sustain more normalized levels of production, we cannot estimate any potential future impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have continued our emphasis on cost management, and have implemented additional measures to adjust to our customers' revised production schedules, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and similar global initiatives.\nThe measures we are taking to address the impact of COVID-19 are expected to remain in place until further clarity can be achieved regarding the recovery and stabilization of the global economy, as well as the resulting impact of COVID-19 on the global automotive industry. We expect to adjust our use of these measures, to the extent possible, based on production volumes and customer demand.\nMANUFACTURING FACILITY FIRE\nOn September 22, 2020, a significant industrial fire occurred at our Malvern Manufacturing Facility in Ohio (Malvern Fire). All associates were evacuated safely and without injury. We continue to focus on managing this disruption and protecting continuity of supply to our customers, including utilizing production capacity and resources at other AAM facilities. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nThere are a number of significant trends affecting the markets in which we compete. Intense competition, volatility in the price of raw materials, including steel, other metallic materials, and resources used in vehicle electrification and electronic components, and significant pricing pressures remain. At the same time, there is a focus on investing in future products that will incorporate the latest technology and meet changing customer demands as certain original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) place increased emphasis on the development of battery and hybrid electric vehicles. The continued advancement of technology and product innovation, as well as the capability to source programs on a global basis, are critical to attracting and retaining business in our global markets.\nINCREASE IN DEMAND FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND ELECTRONIC INTEGRATION The electrification of vehicles continues to expand, driven by a shift in focus by certain OEMs toward battery and hybrid electric vehicles, government regulations related to emissions, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and consumer demand for greater vehicle performance, enhanced functionality, increased electronic content and vehicle connectivity, and affordable convenience options. We are responding, in part, through the development of our hybrid and electric driveline systems, and related subsystems and components, which allow us to meet our customers' needs for high performance vehicles with improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. We recently entered into a technology development agreement with Suzhou Inovance Automotive Ltd., a leading provider of automotive power electronics and powertrain systems in China, to accelerate the development and delivery of scalable, next-generation 3-in-1 electric drive systems, which integrate an inverter, electric motor and gearbox. To date, our hybrid and electric driveline systems have been awarded multiple contracts and received multiple awards.\nAs vehicle electrification and electronic components become an increasingly larger focus for OEMs and suppliers, the industry will likely continue to see the addition of new market entrants from non-traditional automotive companies, including increased competition from technology companies. Further, some traditional automotive industry participants are developing strategic partnerships with technology companies as each party seeks to leverage the existing customer relationships and technical knowledge of the partner, and expedite the development and commercialization of this new technology. An area of focus will be the product development cycle and bridging the gap between the shorter development cycles of information technology (IT) software and controls and the longer development cycles of traditional powertrain components. Our hybrid and electric driveline systems, EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, VecTrac\u2122 Torque Vectoring Technology and TracRite\u00ae Differential Technology, are examples of AAM's enhanced capabilities in supporting vehicle electrification and electronic integration.\nINCREASED DEMAND FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS There has been an increased demand for technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. As a result, OEMs and suppliers are competing to develop and market new and alternative technologies, such as electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells, higher speed transmissions, and downsized, fuel-efficient engines. At the same time, OEMs and suppliers are improving products to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions through lightweighting and efficiency initiatives.\nWe are responding with ongoing research and development (R&D) activities that focus on fuel economy, emissions reductions and environmental improvements by integrating electronics and technology. Through the development of our EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, hybrid and electric driveline systems, QuantumTM lightweight axle technology, high-efficiency axles, PowerLite\u00ae axles and PowerDense\u00ae gears, high strength connecting rod technology, refined vibration control systems, and forged axle tubes, we have significantly advanced our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, safety, and ride and handling performance while reducing emissions and mass. These efforts have led to new business awards and further position us to compete in the global marketplace.\nIn addition to AAM's organic growth in technology and processes, our acquisitions of Metaldyne Performance Group, Inc. (MPG) and certain operations of Mitec Automotive AG (Mitec), as well as our investment in our Liuzhou AAM joint venture, have provided us with complementary technologies, expanded our product portfolio, significantly diversified our global customer base, and strengthened our long-term financial profile through greater scale. The synergies achieved through our strategic initiatives have enhanced AAM's ability to compete in today's technological and regulatory environment, while remaining cost competitive through increased scale and integration.\nSHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE AND OEM PRODUCTION TO LIGHT TRUCK, CROSS-OVER VEHICLES (CUVs) AND SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLES (SUVs) There has been a trend toward increased demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs in certain markets, while demand for passenger cars has decreased. This increase in demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs has been driven by changes in consumer preference as technology advancements have made these vehicles lighter and more efficient, while the stabilizing cost of fuel has made owning these vehicles more affordable.\nCertain OEMs are responding to this change in consumer preference by shifting their focus to developing and manufacturing these types of vehicles, resulting in a significant reduction of passenger car vehicle programs, especially in North America. We have benefited from this trend as a significant portion of our business supports light truck, CUV and SUV programs in North America.\nGLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION As countries around the world continue to increase in importance to the automotive industry, our customers continue to design their products to meet demand in global markets and therefore require global support from their suppliers. For this reason, it is critical that suppliers maintain a global presence in these markets in order to compete for new contracts. We have business and engineering offices around the world to support our global locations and provide technical solutions to our customers on a regional basis, including in China and Europe where consumer acceptance of electric vehicles has been strong.\nThe cyclical nature of the automotive industry, volatile commodity prices, the shifting demands of consumer preference, regulatory requirements and trade agreements require OEMs and suppliers to remain agile with regard to product development and global capability. A critical objective for OEMs and suppliers is the ability to meet these global demands while effectively managing costs. Some OEMs and suppliers may be preparing for these challenges through merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, including potential increased M&A activity as a result of the recent economic impact of COVID-19, development of strategic partnerships and reduction of vehicle platform complexity. In order to effectively drive technology development, recognize cost synergies, and increase global footprint, the industry may continue to see consolidation in the supply base as companies recognize and respond to the need for scalability.\nEVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AS DEMAND FOR CAR-SHARING, RIDE-SHARING AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES INCREASES In addition to selling vehicles, OEMs are increasingly focused on offering their own car-sharing rental businesses and ride-sharing services. Car-sharing typically allows consumers to rent a car for a short period of time, while ride-sharing matches people to available carpools or other services that provide on-demand mobility. With population growth, increased government regulations to ease congestion and generational shifts in preferences, it is expected that the markets for these services will continue to grow, which could cause a change in the type of vehicles utilized. However, the growth in this area may also be temporarily curtailed by the impact of COVID-19, as social distancing recommendations have led to reduced utilization of ride-sharing services by consumers.\nAnother trend developing is the expectation that autonomous, self-driving cars will become more common with continued advancements in technology. Autonomous vehicles present many possible benefits, such as a reduction in traffic collisions caused by human error and reduced traffic congestion, but there are also foreseeable challenges such as liability for damage and software safety and reliability. The increased integration of electronics and vehicle connectivity that will likely be required in autonomous vehicle developments will provide an opportunity for suppliers, such as AAM, with advanced capabilities in this area to be competitive in this expanding market.\nThe discussion of our Results of Operations, Reportable Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for 2019, as compared to 2018, can be found within \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 14, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the sale of the United States (U.S.) operations of our Casting segment (the Casting Sale). The Casting Sale did not include the entities that conduct AAM's casting operations in El Carmen, Mexico, which are now included in our Driveline segment. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNET SALES Net sales were $4,710.8 million in 2020 as compared to $6,530.9 million in 2019. Our change in sales in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,243 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $628 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Net sales for 2020, as compared to 2019, also decreased by approximately $81 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect an estimated $243 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold was $4,128.1 million in 2020 as compared to $5,628.3 million in 2019. The change in cost of goods sold in 2020, as compared to 2019, principally reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $875 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $607 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Cost of goods sold was also impacted by a decrease of approximately $81 million related to metal market pass-through costs and the impact of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of improved operating performance and lower launch costs and our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19. These reductions in cost of goods sold were partially offset as 2019 cost of goods sold reflects an estimated $159 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage and there was no such impact in 2020.\nAs a result of the Malvern Fire, we recorded $63.5 million of expenses and recorded an estimated insurance recovery receivable of $54.2 million, which resulted in a net impact to Cost of goods sold of $9.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which includes our applicable deductible. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nMaterials costs as a percentage of total cost of goods sold were approximately 55% in 2020 and 56% in 2019.\nGROSS PROFIT Gross profit was $582.7 million in 2020 as compared to $902.6 million in 2019. Gross margin was 12.4% in 2020 as compared to 13.8% in 2019. Gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the factors discussed in Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold above. While we were able to significantly reduce our variable costs during 2020, the sharp decline in sales that began during the first quarter and extended into the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID-19, as well as the magnitude of the decline in sales, resulted in a reduction of both gross profit and gross margin.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) SG&A (including R&D) was $313.9 million in 2020 as compared to $364.7 million in 2019. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 6.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2019. R&D spending was $117.4 million in 2020 as compared to $144.7 million in 2019. The change in SG&A in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to lower net R&D expense, which includes a customer engineering, design and development (ED&D) recovery of approximately $15 million. The decrease in SG&A also reflects lower compensation-related expense due, in part, to our restructuring initiatives and the impact of our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nThe increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales during 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to the decline in sales as a result of COVID-19.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $86.6 million as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reduction in amortization expense related to intangible assets reflects the Casting Sale and the disposal of the intangible assets associated with this business.\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES In the first quarter of 2020, the reduction in global automotive production volumes caused by the impact of COVID-19 represented an indicator to test our goodwill for impairment. As a result of this goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying values of our Driveline and Metal Forming reporting units were greater than their respective fair values. As such, we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $510.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further detail.\nAs a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that the carrying value of our Metal Forming segment was greater than its fair value. As such, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $440.0 million in 2019 associated with this segment.\nIn conjunction with the Casting Sale, the assets and liabilities associated with this business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale. Upon reclassification to held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $225.0 million to reduce the carrying value of this business to fair value less cost to sell.\nRESTRUCTURING AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $67.2 million in 2020 and $57.8 million in 2019. As part of our restructuring actions, we incurred severance charges of approximately $22.3 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $36.1 million during 2020. In 2019, we incurred severance charges of approximately $19.4 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $20.4 million. We expect to incur approximately $50 million to $65 million of total restructuring costs in 2021.\nIntegration charges of $8.8 million were incurred in 2020 as we furthered the integration of global enterprise planning (ERP) systems at legacy MPG locations. This compares to acquisition-related costs and integration charges of $18.0 million in 2019. We expect to incur additional integration charges of approximately $5 million in 2021 as we finalize the integration of ERP systems at legacy MPG locations. See Note 2 - Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs for further detail.\nLOSS (GAIN) ON SALE OF BUSINESS In December 2019, we completed the Casting Sale and recorded a loss on sale of business of $21.3 million. During 2020, we finalized certain customary post-closing calculations associated with the Casting Sale, resulting in an additional loss on sale of $1.0 million. These losses are presented in the Loss (gain) on sale of business line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 16 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for further detail.\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Operating loss was $396.0 million in 2020 as compared to operating loss of $301.6 million in 2019. Operating margin was (8.4)% in 2020 as compared to (4.6)% in 2019. The changes in operating income (loss) and operating margin in 2020, as compared to 2019, were due to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, SG&A, Amortization of Intangible Assets, Impairment Charges, Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs and Loss (Gain) on Sale of Business above.\nINTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense was $212.3 million in 2020 and $217.3 million in 2019. The weighted-average interest rate of our total debt outstanding was 5.6% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2019. We expect our interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $200 million to $210 million.\nINTEREST INCOME Interest income was $11.6 million in 2020 and $5.8 million in 2019. Interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, realized and unrealized gains and losses on our short-term investments during the period, and the impact of the interest rate differential on our fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Following are the components of Other Income (Expense) for 2020 and 2019:\nDebt refinancing and redemption costs In December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.2 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the life of these borrowings.\nAlso in 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million and the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.7 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $5.0 million for the payment of early redemption premiums.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest. We expensed approximately $1.0 million for the write-off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing.\nIn July 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment). The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. We expensed $5.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Term Loan B Facility that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowings.\nIn May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100 million and $0.3 million in accrued interest. We also expensed approximately $0.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nGain on bargain purchase of a business In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of certain operations of Mitec, under which we acquired $20.2 million of net assets for a purchase price of $9.4 million, which was funded entirely with available cash. We recognized a gain on bargain purchase of $10.8 million associated with this acquisition.\nPension settlement charges In 2020, our restructuring activities resulted in the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses under our pension plans totaling $0.5 million. In 2019, we offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. pension plans that, if accepted, settled our pension obligations to them. This resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses.\nOther, net Other, net, which includes the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses, our proportionate share of earnings from equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than service costs and certain settlement charges, was expense of $5.2 million in 2020, compared to expense of $12.5 million in 2019. The decreased expense in other, net in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of approximately $6 million of lower net foreign currency remeasurement losses.\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT Income tax was a benefit of $49.2 million in 2020, as compared to a benefit of $48.9 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate was 8.1% in 2020 as compared to 9.2% in 2019.\nIn 2020, our effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as favorable foreign tax rates, the impact of tax credits, and the finalization of an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million. We also recognized a tax benefit of approximately $14.4 million related to our ability to carry back prior year losses, as well as projected current year losses, under the CARES Act to years with the previous 35% tax rate. These income tax benefits were partially offset by our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions, as well as a partial valuation allowance of approximately $5.3 million on certain U.S. federal income tax attributes.\nIn 2019, our income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as the incremental tax expense associated with the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Act), and our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These items were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign tax rates and income tax credits. In addition, as part of the 2017 Act, a one-time transition tax (Transition Tax) was imposed on certain foreign earnings for which U.S. income tax was previously deferred. The Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on February 5, 2019 regarding the Transition Tax, which changed the manner in which we are required to compute the Transition Tax when it is recognized over a two-year period. The application of the final regulations resulted in a $9.3 million income tax benefit, which was recorded in 2019, the period in which the final regulations were issued.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the extent and ultimate impact of COVID-19 on global automotive production volumes, we may experience lower than projected earnings in certain jurisdictions in future periods, and it is reasonably possible that changes in valuation allowances could be recognized in the next twelve months as a result.\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AAM AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) Net loss attributable to AAM was $561.3 million in 2020 as compared to $484.5 million in 2019. Diluted loss per share was $4.96 in 2020 as compared to a diluted loss of $4.31 per share in 2019. Net Loss and EPS were primarily impacted by the factors discussed above.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nOur business is organized into Driveline and Metal Forming segments, with each representing a reportable segment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 - Segment Reporting. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the Casting Sale. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, we continue to present Casting as a segment in the tables below, which is comprised entirely of the U.S. casting operations that were included in the sale.\nThe results of each segment are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of the segment and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\nOur product offerings by segment are as follows:\n\u2022Driveline products consist primarily of front and rear axles, driveshafts, differential assemblies, clutch modules, balance shaft systems, disconnecting driveline technology, and electric and hybrid driveline products and systems for light trucks, SUVs, CUVs, passenger cars and commercial vehicles; and\n\u2022Metal Forming products consist primarily of axle and transmission shafts, ring and pinion gears, differential gears and assemblies, connecting rods and variable valve timing products for OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.\nThe following tables outline our sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\n\n\nThe change in Driveline sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,037 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $974 million related to external customers. The change in Driveline sales also reflects a reduction of approximately $41 million, associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect a reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nThe change in net sales in our Metal Forming segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $380 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $269 million related to external customers. Also for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, Metal Forming sales were impacted by a reduction of approximately $40 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments.\nThe change in net sales in our Casting segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, is the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nWe use Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of earnings to assess the performance of each segment and determine the resources to be allocated to the segments. We define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA for our reportable segments excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Driveline segment was primarily attributable to lower net global automotive production volumes as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance and lower launch costs, as well as the impact of a customer ED&D recovery of approximately $15 million. The change in Driveline Segment Adjusted EBITDA also reflects the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Metal Forming Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance, as well as the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for our Casting segment was the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP and GAAP Information\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) in this MD&A, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules below.\nWe define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items. We believe that EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze operating performance and entity valuation. Our management, the investment community and the banking institutions routinely use EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA, together with other measures, to measure our operating performance relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to assess the relative mix of Adjusted EBITDA by segment. We also believe that Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is used for operational planning and decision-making purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund debt service obligations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, in addition to advancing our strategic initiatives. We believe that operating cash flow, available cash and cash equivalent balances and available committed borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet these needs.\nCOVID-19 Considerations Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have implemented measures to conserve cash and protect our liquidity position, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the CARES Act and similar global initiatives.\nAt December 31, 2020 we had approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity consisting of $557 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $891 million of available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $73 million of available borrowings under foreign credit facilities. We have no significant debt maturities before 2024. Based on our cash and cash equivalents, together with available borrowings under credit facilities, and the measures we are taking to conserve cash, we believe that our current liquidity position and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our primary cash needs for the next 12 months.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities was $454.7 million in 2020 as compared to $559.6 million in 2019. The following factors impacted cash provided by operating activities:\nImpact of COVID-19 We experienced lower earnings and cash flows from operating activities as a result of the significant reduction in production volumes during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nAccounts receivable We experienced a decrease in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $35 million related to the change in our accounts receivable balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in accounts receivable from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was primarily attributable to the timing of payments from customers, partially offset by a slight increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses We experienced an increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $61 million related to the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in balance from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of working capital initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable as a result of the timing of payments to suppliers.\nIncome taxes Income taxes paid, net was $2.1 million in 2020, as compared to $57.1 million in 2019. During 2020, we received an income tax refund of approximately $31 million related to the utilization of net operating losses under the provisions of the CARES Act and an income tax refund of approximately $11 million related to prior alternative minimum tax credits. See Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional detail regarding the CARES Act.\nAlso in 2020, we finalized an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a cash payment to the tax authorities of $18.5 million, and a reduction of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $25.3 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we have recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $22.2 million and $52.6 million, respectively.\nRestructuring and acquisition-related costs We incurred $67.2 million and $57.8 million of charges related to restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a significant portion of these charges were cash charges. In 2021, we expect restructuring and acquisition-related payments to be between $50 million and $65 million for the full year.\nPension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) Our cash payments for OPEB, net of GM cost sharing, were $12.5 million in 2020 and $15.5 million in 2019. This compares to our annual postretirement cost of $10.1 million in 2020 and $11.7 million in 2019. We expect our cash payments for OPEB obligations in 2021, net of GM cost sharing, to be approximately $17 million.\nDue to the availability of our pre-funded pension balances (previous contributions in excess of prior required pension contributions), we expect our regulatory pension funding requirements in 2021 to be less than $1.0 million.\nInterest paid Interest paid in 2020 was $192.4 million as compared to $205.4 million in 2019.\nMalvern Fire In 2020, we received $11.1 million of cash as an advance under our insurance policies associated with expenses incurred as a result of the Malvern Fire. At December 31, 2020, we have an insurance recovery receivable of $43.1 million, which is included in Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $218.4 million as compared to $306.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Capital expenditures were $215.6 million in 2020 and $433.3 million in 2019. We expect our capital spending in 2021 to be approximately 4.5% of sales, which includes support for our global program launches in 2021 and 2022 within our new and incremental business backlog, as well as program capacity increases and future launches of replacement programs.\nAs a result of the Casting Sale completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $141.2 million. Also in 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mitec for approximately $9 million, and made payments totaling approximately $9 million as part of our investment in the Liuzhou AAM joint venture.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in financing activities was $214.5 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $200.0 million in 2019. Total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,455.0 million at year-end 2020 and $3,641.0 million at year-end 2019. The change in total debt outstanding, net of issuance costs, at year-end 2020, as compared to year-end 2019, was primarily due to the factors noted below.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities In 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the prior Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. This also satisfies all payment requirements under the Term Loan B Facility until maturity in 2024.\nIn April 2020, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (Second Amendment). For the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (the Amendment Period), the Second Amendment, among other things, replaced the total net leverage ratio covenant with a new senior secured net leverage ratio covenant, reduced the minimum levels of the cash interest expense coverage ratio covenant, and modified certain covenants restricting the ability of Holdings, AAM and certain subsidiaries of Holdings to create, incur, assume or permit to exist certain additional indebtedness and liens and to make certain restricted payments, voluntary payments and distributions. The Second Amendment also increased the maximum levels of the total net leverage ratio covenant after the Amendment Period, modified the applicable\nmargin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility, and increased the minimum adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for Eurodollar-based loans under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for the Term Loan B Facility remains unchanged. We paid debt issuance costs of $4.6 million in 2020 related to the Second Amendment.\nIn December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, $891.2 million was available under the Revolving Credit Facility. This availability reflects a reduction of $33.8 million for standby letters of credit issued against the facility. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide back-up liquidity for our foreign credit facilities. We intend to use the availability of long-term financing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to refinance any current maturities related to such debt agreements that are not otherwise refinanced on a long-term basis in their local markets, except where otherwise reclassified to Current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n6.875% Notes due 2028 In June 2020, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2028 (the 6.875% Notes). Proceeds from the 6.875% Notes were used primarily to fund the redemption of the remaining $350 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2022 described below and for general corporate purposes. We paid debt issuance costs of $6.4 million in 2020 related to the 6.875% Notes.\nRedemption of 6.625% Notes Due 2022 In 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million, as well as the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest and approximately $5.0 million for early redemption premiums.\nRedemption of 7.75% Notes Due 2019 In May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100.0 million, as well as $0.3 million in accrued interest and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nForeign Credit Facilities We utilize local currency credit facilities to finance the operations of certain foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, $88.8 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $72.8 million was available, as compared to December 31, 2019, when $106.0 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $89.1 million was available.\nTreasury stock Treasury stock increased by $2.7 million in 2020 to $212.0 million as compared to $209.3 million at year-end 2019, due to the withholding and repurchase of shares of AAM stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of performance shares and restricted stock units.\nCredit ratings To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw its ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Credit ratings may affect our cost of borrowing and/or our access to debt capital markets. The credit ratings and outlook currently assigned to our securities by the rating agencies are as follows:\n\nDividend program We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock in 2020 or 2019.\nContractual obligations The following table summarizes payments due on our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\n\n(1)Operating leases include all lease payments through the end of the contractual lease terms, which includes elections for repurchase options which we are reasonably certain to exercise.

Sales to Ford were approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, 9% in of 2019 and 8% in 2018.\nIMPACT OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)\nCOVID-19 OPERATIONAL IMPACT AND AAM ACTIONS\nIn March of 2020, COVID-19 was designated by the World Health Organization as a pandemic illness and began to significantly disrupt global automotive production. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many governmental and public health agencies in locations in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. The majority of our customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production near the end of March, which continued into the second half of the second quarter. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period.\nAt AAM, safety is our top responsibility and that includes the health and wellness of our associates globally. In response to COVID-19, we instituted several operational measures to ensure the safety of our associates, which included the following:\n\u2022Assembled a COVID-19 Task Force comprised of AAM's senior leadership working closely with associates across several functions and regions to coordinate decision making and communication related to actions taken by AAM to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and to ensure that AAM is compliant with all region-specific regulations or requirements associated with COVID-19;\n\u2022Temporarily suspended or reduced production at manufacturing facilities and directed associates who could do so to work remotely;\n\u2022Maintained communication with customers, including planning for business resumption and monitoring announcements regarding new program deferrals or other changes;\n\u2022Initiated thorough cleaning and decontamination procedures at our facilities in preparation for resuming operations; and\n\u2022Designed additional safety measures to further protect associates as production was restored and our associates resumed working in certain of our global facilities.\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2020, our manufacturing locations in Asia, which were impacted by COVID-19 earlier than other global regions, began to stabilize and return to more normalized levels of production. We restarted operations in North America and Europe in May 2020, and we have continued to ramp up production, along with our customers and supply base, through the fourth quarter of 2020. Continuing to maintain more normalized levels of production will depend on future developments, including the potential extension of shelter-in-place orders and increased levels of production by our customers, which are outside of our control. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers, as well as on our customers and their suppliers.\nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19\nWe estimate that the impact of COVID-19 on net sales was approximately $1,243 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the impact to gross profit of this reduction in net sales was approximately $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the extent of the impact of COVID-19, including the possibility of resurgences of COVID-19 cases and our ability to sustain more normalized levels of production, we cannot estimate any potential future impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have continued our emphasis on cost management, and have implemented additional measures to adjust to our customers' revised production schedules, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and similar global initiatives.\nThe measures we are taking to address the impact of COVID-19 are expected to remain in place until further clarity can be achieved regarding the recovery and stabilization of the global economy, as well as the resulting impact of COVID-19 on the global automotive industry. We expect to adjust our use of these measures, to the extent possible, based on production volumes and customer demand.\nMANUFACTURING FACILITY FIRE\nOn September 22, 2020, a significant industrial fire occurred at our Malvern Manufacturing Facility in Ohio (Malvern Fire). All associates were evacuated safely and without injury. We continue to focus on managing this disruption and protecting continuity of supply to our customers, including utilizing production capacity and resources at other AAM facilities. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nThere are a number of significant trends affecting the markets in which we compete. Intense competition, volatility in the price of raw materials, including steel, other metallic materials, and resources used in vehicle electrification and electronic components, and significant pricing pressures remain. At the same time, there is a focus on investing in future products that will incorporate the latest technology and meet changing customer demands as certain original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) place increased emphasis on the development of battery and hybrid electric vehicles. The continued advancement of technology and product innovation, as well as the capability to source programs on a global basis, are critical to attracting and retaining business in our global markets.\nINCREASE IN DEMAND FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND ELECTRONIC INTEGRATION The electrification of vehicles continues to expand, driven by a shift in focus by certain OEMs toward battery and hybrid electric vehicles, government regulations related to emissions, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and consumer demand for greater vehicle performance, enhanced functionality, increased electronic content and vehicle connectivity, and affordable convenience options. We are responding, in part, through the development of our hybrid and electric driveline systems, and related subsystems and components, which allow us to meet our customers' needs for high performance vehicles with improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. We recently entered into a technology development agreement with Suzhou Inovance Automotive Ltd., a leading provider of automotive power electronics and powertrain systems in China, to accelerate the development and delivery of scalable, next-generation 3-in-1 electric drive systems, which integrate an inverter, electric motor and gearbox. To date, our hybrid and electric driveline systems have been awarded multiple contracts and received multiple awards.\nAs vehicle electrification and electronic components become an increasingly larger focus for OEMs and suppliers, the industry will likely continue to see the addition of new market entrants from non-traditional automotive companies, including increased competition from technology companies. Further, some traditional automotive industry participants are developing strategic partnerships with technology companies as each party seeks to leverage the existing customer relationships and technical knowledge of the partner, and expedite the development and commercialization of this new technology. An area of focus will be the product development cycle and bridging the gap between the shorter development cycles of information technology (IT) software and controls and the longer development cycles of traditional powertrain components. Our hybrid and electric driveline systems, EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, VecTrac\u2122 Torque Vectoring Technology and TracRite\u00ae Differential Technology, are examples of AAM's enhanced capabilities in supporting vehicle electrification and electronic integration.\nINCREASED DEMAND FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS There has been an increased demand for technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. As a result, OEMs and suppliers are competing to develop and market new and alternative technologies, such as electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells, higher speed transmissions, and downsized, fuel-efficient engines. At the same time, OEMs and suppliers are improving products to increase fuel economy and reduce emissions through lightweighting and efficiency initiatives.\nWe are responding with ongoing research and development (R&D) activities that focus on fuel economy, emissions reductions and environmental improvements by integrating electronics and technology. Through the development of our EcoTrac\u00ae Disconnecting AWD system, hybrid and electric driveline systems, QuantumTM lightweight axle technology, high-efficiency axles, PowerLite\u00ae axles and PowerDense\u00ae gears, high strength connecting rod technology, refined vibration control systems, and forged axle tubes, we have significantly advanced our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, safety, and ride and handling performance while reducing emissions and mass. These efforts have led to new business awards and further position us to compete in the global marketplace.\nIn addition to AAM's organic growth in technology and processes, our acquisitions of Metaldyne Performance Group, Inc. (MPG) and certain operations of Mitec Automotive AG (Mitec), as well as our investment in our Liuzhou AAM joint venture, have provided us with complementary technologies, expanded our product portfolio, significantly diversified our global customer base, and strengthened our long-term financial profile through greater scale. The synergies achieved through our strategic initiatives have enhanced AAM's ability to compete in today's technological and regulatory environment, while remaining cost competitive through increased scale and integration.\nSHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE AND OEM PRODUCTION TO LIGHT TRUCK, CROSS-OVER VEHICLES (CUVs) AND SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLES (SUVs) There has been a trend toward increased demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs in certain markets, while demand for passenger cars has decreased. This increase in demand for light trucks, CUVs and SUVs has been driven by changes in consumer preference as technology advancements have made these vehicles lighter and more efficient, while the stabilizing cost of fuel has made owning these vehicles more affordable.\nCertain OEMs are responding to this change in consumer preference by shifting their focus to developing and manufacturing these types of vehicles, resulting in a significant reduction of passenger car vehicle programs, especially in North America. We have benefited from this trend as a significant portion of our business supports light truck, CUV and SUV programs in North America.\nGLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION As countries around the world continue to increase in importance to the automotive industry, our customers continue to design their products to meet demand in global markets and therefore require global support from their suppliers. For this reason, it is critical that suppliers maintain a global presence in these markets in order to compete for new contracts. We have business and engineering offices around the world to support our global locations and provide technical solutions to our customers on a regional basis, including in China and Europe where consumer acceptance of electric vehicles has been strong.\nThe cyclical nature of the automotive industry, volatile commodity prices, the shifting demands of consumer preference, regulatory requirements and trade agreements require OEMs and suppliers to remain agile with regard to product development and global capability. A critical objective for OEMs and suppliers is the ability to meet these global demands while effectively managing costs. Some OEMs and suppliers may be preparing for these challenges through merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, including potential increased M&A activity as a result of the recent economic impact of COVID-19, development of strategic partnerships and reduction of vehicle platform complexity. In order to effectively drive technology development, recognize cost synergies, and increase global footprint, the industry may continue to see consolidation in the supply base as companies recognize and respond to the need for scalability.\nEVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AS DEMAND FOR CAR-SHARING, RIDE-SHARING AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES INCREASES In addition to selling vehicles, OEMs are increasingly focused on offering their own car-sharing rental businesses and ride-sharing services. Car-sharing typically allows consumers to rent a car for a short period of time, while ride-sharing matches people to available carpools or other services that provide on-demand mobility. With population growth, increased government regulations to ease congestion and generational shifts in preferences, it is expected that the markets for these services will continue to grow, which could cause a change in the type of vehicles utilized. However, the growth in this area may also be temporarily curtailed by the impact of COVID-19, as social distancing recommendations have led to reduced utilization of ride-sharing services by consumers.\nAnother trend developing is the expectation that autonomous, self-driving cars will become more common with continued advancements in technology. Autonomous vehicles present many possible benefits, such as a reduction in traffic collisions caused by human error and reduced traffic congestion, but there are also foreseeable challenges such as liability for damage and software safety and reliability. The increased integration of electronics and vehicle connectivity that will likely be required in autonomous vehicle developments will provide an opportunity for suppliers, such as AAM, with advanced capabilities in this area to be competitive in this expanding market.\nThe discussion of our Results of Operations, Reportable Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for 2019, as compared to 2018, can be found within \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 14, 2020, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the sale of the United States (U.S.) operations of our Casting segment (the Casting Sale). The Casting Sale did not include the entities that conduct AAM's casting operations in El Carmen, Mexico, which are now included in our Driveline segment. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNET SALES Net sales were $4,710.8 million in 2020 as compared to $6,530.9 million in 2019. Our change in sales in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,243 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $628 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Net sales for 2020, as compared to 2019, also decreased by approximately $81 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect an estimated $243 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold was $4,128.1 million in 2020 as compared to $5,628.3 million in 2019. The change in cost of goods sold in 2020, as compared to 2019, principally reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $875 million associated with the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19, and a reduction of $607 million as a result of the Casting Sale. Cost of goods sold was also impacted by a decrease of approximately $81 million related to metal market pass-through costs and the impact of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of improved operating performance and lower launch costs and our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19. These reductions in cost of goods sold were partially offset as 2019 cost of goods sold reflects an estimated $159 million reduction associated with the GM work stoppage and there was no such impact in 2020.\nAs a result of the Malvern Fire, we recorded $63.5 million of expenses and recorded an estimated insurance recovery receivable of $54.2 million, which resulted in a net impact to Cost of goods sold of $9.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which includes our applicable deductible. See Note 15 - Manufacturing Facility Fire and Insurance Recovery for additional detail regarding the Malvern Fire.\nMaterials costs as a percentage of total cost of goods sold were approximately 55% in 2020 and 56% in 2019.\nGROSS PROFIT Gross profit was $582.7 million in 2020 as compared to $902.6 million in 2019. Gross margin was 12.4% in 2020 as compared to 13.8% in 2019. Gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the factors discussed in Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold above. While we were able to significantly reduce our variable costs during 2020, the sharp decline in sales that began during the first quarter and extended into the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID-19, as well as the magnitude of the decline in sales, resulted in a reduction of both gross profit and gross margin.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) SG&A (including R&D) was $313.9 million in 2020 as compared to $364.7 million in 2019. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 6.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2019. R&D spending was $117.4 million in 2020 as compared to $144.7 million in 2019. The change in SG&A in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to lower net R&D expense, which includes a customer engineering, design and development (ED&D) recovery of approximately $15 million. The decrease in SG&A also reflects lower compensation-related expense due, in part, to our restructuring initiatives and the impact of our emphasis on cost management, including the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nThe increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales during 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to the decline in sales as a result of COVID-19.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $86.6 million as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reduction in amortization expense related to intangible assets reflects the Casting Sale and the disposal of the intangible assets associated with this business.\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES In the first quarter of 2020, the reduction in global automotive production volumes caused by the impact of COVID-19 represented an indicator to test our goodwill for impairment. As a result of this goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying values of our Driveline and Metal Forming reporting units were greater than their respective fair values. As such, we recorded a total goodwill impairment charge of $510.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further detail.\nAs a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that the carrying value of our Metal Forming segment was greater than its fair value. As such, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $440.0 million in 2019 associated with this segment.\nIn conjunction with the Casting Sale, the assets and liabilities associated with this business met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale. Upon reclassification to held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $225.0 million to reduce the carrying value of this business to fair value less cost to sell.\nRESTRUCTURING AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $67.2 million in 2020 and $57.8 million in 2019. As part of our restructuring actions, we incurred severance charges of approximately $22.3 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $36.1 million during 2020. In 2019, we incurred severance charges of approximately $19.4 million, as well as implementation costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and plant exit costs, of approximately $20.4 million. We expect to incur approximately $50 million to $65 million of total restructuring costs in 2021.\nIntegration charges of $8.8 million were incurred in 2020 as we furthered the integration of global enterprise planning (ERP) systems at legacy MPG locations. This compares to acquisition-related costs and integration charges of $18.0 million in 2019. We expect to incur additional integration charges of approximately $5 million in 2021 as we finalize the integration of ERP systems at legacy MPG locations. See Note 2 - Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs for further detail.\nLOSS (GAIN) ON SALE OF BUSINESS In December 2019, we completed the Casting Sale and recorded a loss on sale of business of $21.3 million. During 2020, we finalized certain customary post-closing calculations associated with the Casting Sale, resulting in an additional loss on sale of $1.0 million. These losses are presented in the Loss (gain) on sale of business line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 16 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for further detail.\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Operating loss was $396.0 million in 2020 as compared to operating loss of $301.6 million in 2019. Operating margin was (8.4)% in 2020 as compared to (4.6)% in 2019. The changes in operating income (loss) and operating margin in 2020, as compared to 2019, were due to the factors discussed in Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, SG&A, Amortization of Intangible Assets, Impairment Charges, Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Costs and Loss (Gain) on Sale of Business above.\nINTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense was $212.3 million in 2020 and $217.3 million in 2019. The weighted-average interest rate of our total debt outstanding was 5.6% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2019. We expect our interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $200 million to $210 million.\nINTEREST INCOME Interest income was $11.6 million in 2020 and $5.8 million in 2019. Interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, realized and unrealized gains and losses on our short-term investments during the period, and the impact of the interest rate differential on our fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Following are the components of Other Income (Expense) for 2020 and 2019:\nDebt refinancing and redemption costs In December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.2 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the life of these borrowings.\nAlso in 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million and the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest. As a result, we expensed approximately $1.7 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $5.0 million for the payment of early redemption premiums.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest. We expensed approximately $1.0 million for the write-off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing.\nIn July 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment). The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. We expensed $5.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the existing Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Term Loan B Facility that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowings.\nIn May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100 million and $0.3 million in accrued interest. We also expensed approximately $0.1 million for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs that we had been amortizing over the expected life of the borrowing, and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nGain on bargain purchase of a business In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of certain operations of Mitec, under which we acquired $20.2 million of net assets for a purchase price of $9.4 million, which was funded entirely with available cash. We recognized a gain on bargain purchase of $10.8 million associated with this acquisition.\nPension settlement charges In 2020, our restructuring activities resulted in the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses under our pension plans totaling $0.5 million. In 2019, we offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. pension plans that, if accepted, settled our pension obligations to them. This resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the accelerated recognition of certain deferred losses.\nOther, net Other, net, which includes the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses, our proportionate share of earnings from equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than service costs and certain settlement charges, was expense of $5.2 million in 2020, compared to expense of $12.5 million in 2019. The decreased expense in other, net in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of approximately $6 million of lower net foreign currency remeasurement losses.\nINCOME TAX BENEFIT Income tax was a benefit of $49.2 million in 2020, as compared to a benefit of $48.9 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate was 8.1% in 2020 as compared to 9.2% in 2019.\nIn 2020, our effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as favorable foreign tax rates, the impact of tax credits, and the finalization of an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million. We also recognized a tax benefit of approximately $14.4 million related to our ability to carry back prior year losses, as well as projected current year losses, under the CARES Act to years with the previous 35% tax rate. These income tax benefits were partially offset by our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions, as well as a partial valuation allowance of approximately $5.3 million on certain U.S. federal income tax attributes.\nIn 2019, our income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in no income tax benefit, as well as the incremental tax expense associated with the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Act), and our inability to realize an income tax benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These items were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign tax rates and income tax credits. In addition, as part of the 2017 Act, a one-time transition tax (Transition Tax) was imposed on certain foreign earnings for which U.S. income tax was previously deferred. The Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on February 5, 2019 regarding the Transition Tax, which changed the manner in which we are required to compute the Transition Tax when it is recognized over a two-year period. The application of the final regulations resulted in a $9.3 million income tax benefit, which was recorded in 2019, the period in which the final regulations were issued.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the extent and ultimate impact of COVID-19 on global automotive production volumes, we may experience lower than projected earnings in certain jurisdictions in future periods, and it is reasonably possible that changes in valuation allowances could be recognized in the next twelve months as a result.\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AAM AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) Net loss attributable to AAM was $561.3 million in 2020 as compared to $484.5 million in 2019. Diluted loss per share was $4.96 in 2020 as compared to a diluted loss of $4.31 per share in 2019. Net Loss and EPS were primarily impacted by the factors discussed above.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nOur business is organized into Driveline and Metal Forming segments, with each representing a reportable segment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 - Segment Reporting. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed the Casting Sale. The Casting Sale did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in our business that has had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, we continue to present Casting as a segment in the tables below, which is comprised entirely of the U.S. casting operations that were included in the sale.\nThe results of each segment are

ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $1,037 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $974 million related to external customers. The change in Driveline sales also reflects a reduction of approximately $41 million, associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments. These reductions in sales were partially offset as 2019 sales reflect a reduction associated with the GM work stoppage that occurred in the second half of 2019. There was no such impact in 2020.\nThe change in net sales in our Metal Forming segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflects an estimated reduction of approximately $380 million associated with the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of COVID-19. This estimated reduction includes approximately $269 million related to external customers. Also for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, Metal Forming sales were impacted by a reduction of approximately $40 million associated with the effect of metal market pass-throughs to our customers and the impact of foreign exchange related to translation adjustments.\nThe change in net sales in our Casting segment for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, is the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nWe use Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of earnings to assess the performance of each segment and determine the resources to be allocated to the segments. We define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA for our reportable segments excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Driveline segment was primarily attributable to lower net global automotive production volumes as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance and lower launch costs, as well as the impact of a customer ED&D recovery of approximately $15 million. The change in Driveline Segment Adjusted EBITDA also reflects the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Metal Forming Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the impact of the decline in global automotive production as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by improved operating performance, as well as the impact of our continued emphasis on cost management, and the additional measures that we implemented in response to the impact of COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA for our Casting segment was the result of the Casting Sale that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 as AAM no longer operates in this business.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP and GAAP Information\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) in this MD&A, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules below.\nWe define EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, gain (loss) on the sale of a business, impairment charges, pension settlements, and non-recurring items. We believe that EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze operating performance and entity valuation. Our management, the investment community and the banking institutions routinely use EBITDA and Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA, together with other measures, to measure our operating performance relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to assess the relative mix of Adjusted EBITDA by segment. We also believe that Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is used for operational planning and decision-making purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(561.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(484.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>212.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit </td> <td>(49.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>521.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>536.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and acquisition-related costs </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt refinancing and redemption costs </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of business </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>510.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlements </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recurring items: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Malvern Fire charges, net of recoveries </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on bargain purchase of business </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-recurring items </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>719.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>970.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund debt service obligations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, in addition to advancing our strategic initiatives. We believe that operating cash flow, available cash and cash equivalent balances and available committed borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet these needs.\nCOVID-19 Considerations Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, we have implemented measures to conserve cash and protect our liquidity position, including the following:\n\u2022Continuing to flex our variable cost structure;\n\u2022Continuing to manage our controllable expenses, net of costs to ensure the health and safety of our\nassociates;\n\u2022Reduced the annual cash retainer for each non-employee director by 40% through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced salaries for executive officers by 30% and for certain other associates by various percentages depending on level through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Reduced our capital expenditures for the year;\n\u2022Amended our Credit Agreement to, among other things, revise our financial maintenance covenants to provide additional financial flexibility; and\n\u2022Utilizing options to defer and reduce tax payments and to claim tax refunds and employment credits through the CARES Act and similar global initiatives.\nAt December 31, 2020 we had approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity consisting of $557 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $891 million of available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $73 million of available borrowings under foreign credit facilities. We have no significant debt maturities before 2024. Based on our cash and cash equivalents, together with available borrowings under credit facilities, and the measures we are taking to conserve cash, we believe that our current liquidity position and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our primary cash needs for the next 12 months.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities was $454.7 million in 2020 as compared to $559.6 million in 2019. The following factors impacted cash provided by operating activities:\nImpact of COVID-19 We experienced lower earnings and cash flows from operating activities as a result of the significant reduction in production volumes during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nAccounts receivable We experienced a decrease in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $35 million related to the change in our accounts receivable balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in accounts receivable from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was primarily attributable to the timing of payments from customers, partially offset by a slight increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses We experienced an increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $61 million related to the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses balance from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in balance from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. This change was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of working capital initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable as a result of the timing of payments to suppliers.\nIncome taxes Income taxes paid, net was $2.1 million in 2020, as compared to $57.1 million in 2019. During 2020, we received an income tax refund of approximately $31 million related to the utilization of net operating losses under the provisions of the CARES Act and an income tax refund of approximately $11 million related to prior alternative minimum tax credits. See Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional detail regarding the CARES Act.\nAlso in 2020, we finalized an advance pricing agreement in a foreign jurisdiction, which resulted in a cash payment to the tax authorities of $18.5 million, and a reduction of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $25.3 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we have recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $22.2 million and $52.6 million, respectively.\nRestructuring and acquisition-related costs We incurred $67.2 million and $57.8 million of charges related to restructuring and acquisition-related costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a significant portion of these charges were cash charges. In 2021, we expect restructuring and acquisition-related payments to be between $50 million and $65 million for the full year.\nPension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) Our cash payments for OPEB, net of GM cost sharing, were $12.5 million in 2020 and $15.5 million in 2019. This compares to our annual postretirement cost of $10.1 million in 2020 and $11.7 million in 2019. We expect our cash payments for OPEB obligations in 2021, net of GM cost sharing, to be approximately $17 million.\nDue to the availability of our pre-funded pension balances (previous contributions in excess of prior required pension contributions), we expect our regulatory pension funding requirements in 2021 to be less than $1.0 million.\nInterest paid Interest paid in 2020 was $192.4 million as compared to $205.4 million in 2019.\nMalvern Fire In 2020, we received $11.1 million of cash as an advance under our insurance policies associated with expenses incurred as a result of the Malvern Fire. At December 31, 2020, we have an insurance recovery receivable of $43.1 million, which is included in Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $218.4 million as compared to $306.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Capital expenditures were $215.6 million in 2020 and $433.3 million in 2019. We expect our capital spending in 2021 to be approximately 4.5% of sales, which includes support for our global program launches in 2021 and 2022 within our new and incremental business backlog, as well as program capacity increases and future launches of replacement programs.\nAs a result of the Casting Sale completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $141.2 million. Also in 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mitec for approximately $9 million, and made payments totaling approximately $9 million as part of our investment in the Liuzhou AAM joint venture.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used in financing activities was $214.5 million in 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $200.0 million in 2019. Total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,455.0 million at year-end 2020 and $3,641.0 million at year-end 2019. The change in total debt outstanding, net of issuance costs, at year-end 2020, as compared to year-end 2019, was primarily due to the factors noted below.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities In 2019, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment, among other things, established $340 million in incremental term loan A commitments with a maturity date of July 29, 2024 (Term Loan A Facility due 2024), reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $932 million to $925 million and extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 6, 2022 to July 29, 2024, and modified the applicable margin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin and the maturity date for the Term Loan B Facility remained unchanged. The proceeds of $340 million were used to repay all of the outstanding loans under the prior Term Loan A Facility and a portion of the outstanding Term Loan B Facility, resulting in no additional indebtedness. This also satisfies all payment requirements under the Term Loan B Facility until maturity in 2024.\nIn April 2020, Holdings, AAM, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of Holdings entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (Second Amendment). For the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (the Amendment Period), the Second Amendment, among other things, replaced the total net leverage ratio covenant with a new senior secured net leverage ratio covenant, reduced the minimum levels of the cash interest expense coverage ratio covenant, and modified certain covenants restricting the ability of Holdings, AAM and certain subsidiaries of Holdings to create, incur, assume or permit to exist certain additional indebtedness and liens and to make certain restricted payments, voluntary payments and distributions. The Second Amendment also increased the maximum levels of the total net leverage ratio covenant after the Amendment Period, modified the applicable\nmargin with respect to interest rates under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and interest rates and commitment fees under the Revolving Credit Facility, and increased the minimum adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for Eurodollar-based loans under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for the Term Loan B Facility remains unchanged. We paid debt issuance costs of $4.6 million in 2020 related to the Second Amendment.\nIn December 2020, we made a voluntary prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan B Facility and paid approximately $15 million on our Term Loan A Facility due 2024, which included approximately $13 million for the prepayment of all required payments under the Term Loan A Facility due 2024 for 2021.\nIn December 2019, we used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Casting Sale to make a payment on our Term Loan B Facility, which included a principal payment of $59.8 million and $0.4 million in accrued interest.\nAt December 31, 2020, $891.2 million was available under the Revolving Credit Facility. This availability reflects a reduction of $33.8 million for standby letters of credit issued against the facility. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide back-up liquidity for our foreign credit facilities. We intend to use the availability of long-term financing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to refinance any current maturities related to such debt agreements that are not otherwise refinanced on a long-term basis in their local markets, except where otherwise reclassified to Current portion of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n6.875% Notes due 2028 In June 2020, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2028 (the 6.875% Notes). Proceeds from the 6.875% Notes were used primarily to fund the redemption of the remaining $350 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2022 described below and for general corporate purposes. We paid debt issuance costs of $6.4 million in 2020 related to the 6.875% Notes.\nRedemption of 6.625% Notes Due 2022 In 2020, we voluntarily redeemed our 6.625% Notes due 2022, which resulted in total principal payments of $450 million, as well as the payment of $7.7 million in accrued interest and approximately $5.0 million for early redemption premiums.\nRedemption of 7.75% Notes Due 2019 In May 2019, we voluntarily redeemed the remaining balance outstanding under our 7.75% Notes due 2019. This resulted in a principal payment of $100.0 million, as well as $0.3 million in accrued interest and approximately $2.2 million for an early redemption premium.\nForeign Credit Facilities We utilize local currency credit facilities to finance the operations of certain foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, $88.8 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $72.8 million was available, as compared to December 31, 2019, when $106.0 million was outstanding under our foreign credit facilities and an additional $89.1 million was available.\nTreasury stock Treasury stock increased by $2.7 million in 2020 to $212.0 million as compared to $209.3 million at year-end 2019, due to the withholding and repurchase of shares of AAM stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of performance shares and restricted stock units.\nCredit ratings To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors.
