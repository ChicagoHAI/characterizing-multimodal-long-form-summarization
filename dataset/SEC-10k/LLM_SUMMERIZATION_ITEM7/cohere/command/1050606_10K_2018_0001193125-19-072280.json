MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGeneral\nSalem Media Group, Inc. (\u201cSalem\u201d) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable from period to period due to acquisitions and dispositions. Refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for details of each of these transactions.\nHistorical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Actual future results may differ from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the need for additional funds to service our debt and to execute our business strategy, our ability to access borrowings under our ABL Facility, reductions in revenue forecasts, our ability to renew our broadcast licenses, changes in interest rates, the timing of, our ability to complete any acquisitions or dispositions, costs and synergies resulting from the integration of any completed acquisitions, our ability to effectively manage costs, our ability to drive and manage growth, the popularity of radio as a broadcasting and advertising medium, changes in consumer tastes, the impact of general economic conditions in the United States or in specific markets in which we do business, industry conditions, including existing competition and future competitive technologies and cancellation, disruptions or postponements of advertising schedules in response to national or world events, our ability to generate revenues from new sources, including local commerce and technology-based initiatives, the impact of regulatory rules or proceedings that may affect our business from time to time, and the future write off of any material portion of the fair value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill,\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOverview\nWe have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.\nWe measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.\nOur principal sources of broadcast revenue include:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of block program time to national and local program producers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through Salem Surround;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the sale of advertising time on our national network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the syndication of programming on our national network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts and programs;

Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of our broadcasting operations.\nRevenues generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms are reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this quarterly report on Form 10-K. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.\nBroadcast revenues are impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations' ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks' ability to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio, which develops quarterly reports measuring a radio station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time available for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.\nNielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (\u201cPPM\u201d) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter time periods between when advertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the PPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the \u201cpanel\u201d (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time.\nAs is typical in the radio broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising during election years by way of political advertisements. During election years, or even numbered years, we benefit from a significant increase in political advertising revenue over non-election or odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues. Quarterly block programming revenue tends not to vary significantly because program rates are generally set annually and recognized on a per program basis.\nOur cash flows from broadcasting are affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period, when we develop a radio station's listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.\nIn broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange air time or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter air time or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the air time or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 97% of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash as compared to 98% during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBroadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities.\nDigital Media\nWeb-based and digital content continues to be a focus of future development. Our digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing and health-themed content, e-commerce, audio and video streaming, and other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Digital media revenues are impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our broadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product sites. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold associated with e-commerce sites.\nPublishing\nOur publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery\u00ae Publishing, a print magazine and our self-publishing services. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Publishing revenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print magazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery\u00ae Publishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our Publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nBroadcast revenue growth remains challenged, which we believe is due to several factors, including increasing competition from other forms of content distribution and time spent listening by audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. This increase in competition and mix of radio listening time may lead advertisers to conclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that provide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.\nOur broadcast revenues are particularly dependent on our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 12.0% and 10.4%, respectively, of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription revenues, are challenged both economically and by the increasing use of other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors. Because digital media has been a growth area for us, decreases in digital revenue streams could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views. We have experienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page which are generally sold at lower rates. Digital media revenue is impacted by page views and the number of advertisements per page. Declines in desktop page views impact revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to cross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.\nWe may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, seek to renew or renegotiate lease terms under a \u201cblend and extend\u201d option that we believe provides us with favorable lease terms over an extended period from five to twenty years. As rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, we expect our lease expense to increase by approximately $0.6 million over future periods. Actual cash payments for leased properties are expected to remain consistent with annual increases of up to 3% or a percentage of the Consumer Price Index.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators-Same-Station Definition\nIn the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an as-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies Refer to \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station results for each of the four quarters of that year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.\nOur presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nItem 101 of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain non-GAAP financial information may be presented in this report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (\u201cSOI\u201d), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses, Same Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nThe performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. SOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews associated with impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. SOI does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each\nquarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four quarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net digital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Income is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal review. This measurement does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the disposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before impairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFor all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial performance, develop budgets, manage expenditures, and determine employee compensation. Our presentation of this additional information is not to be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and broadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of Station Operating Income and Same\nStation Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in the table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss).

million reflects a $1.6 million decline in local programming revenue that was offset by a $1.2 million increase in national programming revenue. Declines in local programming revenue include $0.9 million from WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) that was operated under an LMA as of December 1, 2017 through the sale of the station on August 28, 2018, and $0.7 million from program cancellations that we believe are due to increased competition from other broadcasters and from the loss of broadcast customers to digital. The increase in national programming revenue includes a $1.2 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations due to an increase in the number of programmers featured on-air that creates a higher demand for premium time slots. This higher demand for premium time slots often results in realization of higher rates. Annual renewals reflect a low single digit average rate increase with 95% of our programmers renewing. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million decline in programming from our Business format radio stations that restrict content to ensure compliance with securities rules and regulations and a $0.2 million decline in programming from all other formats.\nTotal advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, increased by $63,000 on a consolidated basis, which includes a $1.9 million increase in political advertising as compared to the same period of the prior year. Political\nrevenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years. Excluding political, advertising revenue declined by a net $1.9 million including a $3.6 million decline in local advertising offset by a $1.7 million increase in national advertising. Declines in local advertising, net of political, include a $2.2 million decline from our CCM format radio stations that were largely attributable to declines in the spot rate charged due to competition from other broadcasters that offer lower rates primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, a $1.1 million decline from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and $0.1 million from our Business News format radio stations, all reflecting the loss of broadcast advertisers to digital. Additionally, $0.4 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station KGBI-FM in Omaha, Nebraska and $0.3 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station WQVN-AM in Miami, Florida. These declines in local advertising were offset by a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations reflecting the addition of KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon that we began programming in April of 2018. The $1.7 million increase in national advertising, net of political, includes a $1.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations primarily in our Dallas and Atlanta markets and a $0.1 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. These increases, particularly from our CCM format stations, reflect the impact of higher ratings achieved in the current year as compared to the prior year that creates an increase in demand for air-time. This increase in demand can result in higher rates.\nLocal digital revenue, or that which is generated from our radio stations and networks increased $1.5 million, including a $0.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations, a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. During 2018, we launched Salem Surround, a national multimedia advertising agency. We continue to expand our digital product offerings to include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted advertising and other services to address the move of advertising dollars from broadcast to digital. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nDeclines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number of infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the infomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.\nNetwork revenue increased by $1.2 million of which $1.4 million was due to an increase in political advertising revenue and $0.3 million was generated from donor development campaigns that were offset by a $0.5 million decrease in national advertising revenue due to lower spot rates as a result of higher competition from other national broadcasters and agencies. Political revenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years.\nOther revenue increased $0.4 million including a $0.2 million increase in LMA fees associated with radio stations WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM), Miami, Florida, and WBIX-AM, Boston Massachusetts, a $0.2 million increase in sponsorship revenue and a $0.2 million increase in broadcast tower rental fees, offset by a $0.2 million decline in event revenue due to a reduction in the number of events held and a $0.1 million decline in listener purchasing program revenue. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of the events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather that can affect attendance.\nOn a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue increased $3.5 million, which reflects these items net of the impact of stations with acquisitions, dispositions and format changes.\nNet Digital Media Revenue\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Digital Media Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(501 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of national net digital media revenue, or revenue generated from our websites and digital subscriptions, for each digital media revenue source.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Advertising, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Streaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Subscriptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Downloads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> e-commerce\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Digital Media Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> National digital advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, decreased $2.2 million on a consolidated basis including a $1.8 million decline from SWN and a $1.0 million decline from our conservative opinion websites that was offset by a $0.6 million increase from Eagle Financial Publications including a $0.2 million increase in sales volume and a $0.4 million increase from Traders Crux, that was acquired on July 6, 2017. Declines in national digital advertising were largely attributable to changes in the Facebook newsfeed algorithm that negatively affects both the rate and volume of our page views, a loss of advertisers who moved spending to digital programmatic advertisers, specifically Facebook and Google, and an increase in advertisers deciding to cut or eliminate advertising on conservative websites. Page views from Facebook declined by 28% as compared to the same period of the prior year. We continue to acquire, develop and promote the use of mobile applications, particularly for our Christian mobile applications, to reduce our dependency on page views from digital programmatic advertisers. Acquisitions of mobile applications and digital media assets are discussed in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. As mobile page views carry fewer advertisements and typically have shorter site visits, our growth in mobile application generated traffic is larger than our growth in revenue from the mobile applications.\nDigital streaming revenue decreased $0.1 million as compared to the same period of the prior year based on lower usage of content available on our Christian websites. There were no significant changes in sales volume or rates as compared to the prior year.\nDigital subscription revenue increased by $1.6 million on a consolidated basis including the impact of the August 2017 acquisition of Intelligence Reporter and the August 2018 acquisition of the Hilary Kramer newsletter. SWN's Churchstaffing.com subscription revenue increased by $0.2 million due to increased marketing efforts combined with a re-design of the website. There were no significant changes in subscriber rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nDigital download revenue increased by $0.3 million due to the acquisition of Childrens-Ministry-Deals.com on July 24, 2018 offset by lower volume of downloads generated from our church product websites, WorshipHouseMedia.com and SermonSpiceTM.com. There were no changes in significant rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nE-commerce revenue decreased by $0.1 million as compared to the same period of the prior year. There was a 7% decrease in the number of products sold through our wellness website that was offset by an increase in the average unit price of 3%. The decrease in the number of products sold was due to a reduction in the discounts offered during the period and a lower volume of new customers as compared to the prior year.\nOther revenue includes revenue sharing arrangements for mobile applications and mail list rentals. There were no significant changes in volume or rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nNet Publishing Revenue\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Publishing Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,757 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net publishing revenue for each publishing revenue source.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated Sales Returns & Allowances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,340 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,998 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E-Book Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Self-Publishing Fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Print Magazine Subscriptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Print Magazine Advertisements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Advertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Publishing Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The $1.1 million decrease in book sales includes a $0.9 million increase from Regnery\u00ae Publishing that was offset by a $2.0 million decrease from Salem Author Services. The $2.0 million decrease from Salem Author Services was due to a reduction in the number of books sold and the phase-out of operations for BookPrinting.com, a small printing-only division of Hillcrest Media, for which our operating margins did not meet our expectations. Regnery\u00ae Publishing sales reflect a 6% increase in volume with a 1% decrease in the average price per unit sold. The increase in volume for Regnery\u00ae Publishing was primarily from the sale of print books. Print books were sold at heavily discounted prices during the third quarter of this year due to a change in distribution partners under which it was more beneficial to sell books held in inventory with the former distribution partner than to move it to the new distribution partner. We recognized an increase of $0.7 million or 15% in the estimated sales returns and allowances based on the higher volume of print book sales associated with the change in our distribution partner. Book sales through Regnery\u00ae Publishing are directly attributable to the number of titles released each period and the composite mix of titles. Revenues can vary significantly based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book.\nRegnery\u00ae Publishing e-book sales decreased $0.3 million due to a 21% decrease in sales volume. The average price per unit sold was consistent year-over-year. E-book sales vary based on the composite mix of titles released and available in each period. Revenues can vary significantly based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book.\nSelf-publishing fees was consistent with the same period of the prior year with no notable changes in fees charged to authors.\nDeclines in print magazine subscription and print magazine advertising revenue are due to the closure of Preaching Magazine, YouthWorker Journal, FaithTalk Magazine and Homecoming The Magazine as of May 2017. Lower demand and distribution levels resulted in corresponding declines in advertising revenues.\nDigital adverting revenue decreased $0.2 million primarily due to the transfer of Preaching.com and YouthWorker.com to SWN following the end of print publications for Preaching Magazine and YouthWorker\nJournal and the closure of the Salem Publishing Homecoming website. Sales volume and rates were comparable to the same period of the prior year.\nOther revenue includes change fees, video trailers, public-relation services and website revenues. There were no changes in volume or rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Broadcast Operating Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Same Station Broadcast Operating Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>143,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Broadcast operating expenses increased by $3.1 million including a $2.6 million increase in employee-related expenses due to a higher per-employee cost of salary, hourly wages and benefits, a $0.5 million increase in production and programming expenses, $0.4 million increase in costs of sales with higher digital revenues from our consumer products division and a $0.1 million increase in professional services, that was offset by a $0.3 million decrease in music license fees and a $0.2 million decrease in bad debt expense. Rent expense increased by $0.4 million from recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term due to a number of lease renewals executed during the year. Rental increases were offset with a $0.2 million decline in property tax expenses due to the sale of broadcasting properties during the year. Refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for details of these sales.\nOn a same-station basis, broadcast operating expenses increased by $3.7 million. The increase in broadcast operating expenses on a same-station basis reflects these items net of the impact of start-up costs associated with acquisitions, station dispositions and format changes.\nDigital Media Operating Expenses\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Media Operating Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(379 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Digital media operating expense declined by $0.4 million due to a $1.0 million decrease in employee-related expenses from a reduction in headcount, a $0.3 million decrease in facility-related expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in royalties, a $0.1 million decrease in streaming and hosting fees and a $0.1 million reduction in sales-based commissions and incentives consistent with lower revenues that were offset by a $0.5 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses, a $0.5 million increase in software fees, a $0.3 million increase in professional services and a $0.1 million increase in bad debt expense.\nPublishing Operating Expenses\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Publishing Operating Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,079 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Publishing operating expenses declined by $2.1 million of which $1.4 million was due to a reduction in the consolidated cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes a $1.1 million decrease from a lower sales volume\nfor Salem Author Services, a $0.2 million decline due to a reduction in the number of magazine titles published, and a $0.1 million decrease in Regnery\u00ae Publishing. The gross profit margin for Regnery\u00ae Publishing was 58% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 54% for the same period of the prior year as revenue growth outpaced expense growth. Regnery\u00ae Publishing margins are impacted by the volume of e-book sales, which have higher margins due to the nature of delivery and lack of sales returns and allowances. The gross profit margin for our self-publishing entities was 66% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 63% for the same period of the prior year due to lower print costs based on sales volume. Additionally, there was a $0.4 million decrease in advertising and promotion expense, a $0.2 million decrease in facility-related expenses, a $0.1 million decrease in employee benefit costs due to lower volume of claims under our health insurance plan and a $0.1 million decline in payroll-related expenses due to reductions in headcount, offset by a $0.2 million increase in travel related expenses associated with publishing conventions and seminars.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(569 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Unallocated corporate expenses include shared services, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, that are not directly attributable to any one of our operating segments. The decrease of $0.6 million includes a $0.9 million reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation and a $0.1 million decrease in professional services offset by a $0.5 million net increase in employee-related expenses. Stock-based compensation expense fluctuates over time based on the vesting period of outstanding awards and the number of awards that actually vest.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived Long-Term Assets Other Than Goodwill\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Long Term Assets Other Than Goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,005.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The impairment charge of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $2.8 million of impairments associated with our broadcast licenses and $36,000 of impairments associated with mastheads that were recognized during our annual testing period in the fourth quarter of 2018. The broadcast licenses impairment charge was driven by a decrease in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the broadcast industry. Based on our review and analysis, we determined that the carrying value of broadcast licenses in Cleveland, Louisville and Portland were impaired. We believe that these decreases are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.\nThe $36,000 masthead impairment charge was driven by decreases in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the print magazine industry. We believe that these decreases are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.\nWe ceased publishing Preaching Magazine, YouthWorker Journal, FaithTalk Magazine and Homecoming The Magazine upon issuance of the May 2017 publication due to operating results that did not meet our expectations. We performed impairment tests as of March 31, 2017 due to the likelihood at that time that these print magazines would be sold or otherwise disposed of. Due to reductions in forecasted operating cash flows and indications of interest from potential buyers, we recorded an impairment charge of $19,000 associated with mastheads during the period ended March 31, 2017.\nDepreciation Expense\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(335 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Depreciation expense decreased $0.3 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease reflects the impact of capital expenditures made in prior years associated with data processing equipment and computer software that have shorter estimated useful lives than towers and broadcast assets and are fully depreciated as of the current year. There were no changes in our depreciation methods or in the estimated useful lives of our asset groups.\nAmortization Expense\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Amortization expense increased by $1.6 million compared to the same period of the prior year due to the acquisitions of Trader's Crux in July 2017 and Intelligence Report and TeacherTube.com in August 2017, Childrens-Ministry-Deals.com in July 2018 and Hilary Kramer newsletter in August 2018, that were partially offset by reductions in the amortization of intangible assets acquired with Mill City Press that are now fully amortized.

We review the probabilities of possible future payments to estimate the fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration liability will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Refer to Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed analysis of the changes in our assumptions and the impact for each contingency.\nChanges in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which they are identified. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating results.\nNet (Gain) Loss on the Disposition of Assets\nTable

interest due under promissory notes.\nInterest expense includes interest due on outstanding debt balances, interest due on our swap agreement prior to the termination of the agreement in May 2017, and non-cash accretion associated with deferred installments and contingent earn-out consideration from certain acquisitions. The increase of $1.6 million reflects the Notes and ABL Facility outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the Term Loan B and Revolver that were outstanding through May 19, 2017 of the prior year. Future changes in interest rates will not impact our fixed rate Notes, but an increase in interest rates may impact the variable rate at which we can borrow under our ABL Facility and result in higher interest charges.\nThe $0.4 million decline in the fair value of interest rate swap reflects the mark-to-market adjustments to our swap agreement prior to its termination on May 19, 2017.\nThe gain in 2018 on the early retirement of long-term debt reflects $16.4 million of repurchases of the Notes at prices below face value resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.6 million. The loss on early retirement of long-term debt for the same period of the prior year reflects $0.6 million of the unamortized discount and $1.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the payoff and termination of the Term Loan B on May 19, 2017, $0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Revolver terminated on May 19, 2017, and a $0.6 million loss to exit and terminate our swap agreement on May 19, 2017.\nNet miscellaneous income and expenses includes miscellaneous receipts such as usage fees for real estate properties and miscellaneous expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid a contract termination fee of $0.1 million for not exercising our option right to purchase radio station KHTE-FM in Little Rock, Arkansas. This was offset by insurance proceeds associated with hurricane Irma in Tampa, Florida market. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $78,000 on an investment.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,870 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> We recognized a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a tax benefit of $20.9 million in the same period of the prior year. During the 2018 calendar year, we sold groups of assets constituting various radio station business lines that resulted in a decrease in sales apportioned to various states. As a result of the sale of the various radio station business lines coupled with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cAct'), the change in our provision for income taxes of $23.3 million accounts for the $20.5 million impact of the above Act during December 31, 2017 and a $2.8 million impact from the revaluation of the state net operating loss tax attributes as a result of the sale of various group assets along with current year state minimum taxes. A pretax loss of $0.7 million was recognized for calendar year 2018 compared to pre-tax income of $3.8 million for calendar year 2017. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes, or the effective tax rate was (343.9)% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (553.0)% for the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate for each period differs from the federal statutory income rate of 21.0% due to the effect of the sale of business assets in various states, state income taxes, certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, and changes in the valuation allowance from the utilization of certain state net operating loss carryforwards.\nNet Income (Loss)\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,192 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,836 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table> We recognized a net loss of $3.2 million compared to net income of $24.6 million during the same period of the prior year. The change in net income (loss) was attributable to the reasons described above.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSignificant areas for which management uses estimates include:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> revenue recognition,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> probabilities associated with the potential for contingent earn-out consideration;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fair value measurements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> contingency reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> allowance for doubtful accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> sales returns and allowances;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> barter transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> inventory reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> reserves for royalty advances;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fair value of equity awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> self-insurance reserves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> income tax valuation allowances; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> uncertain tax positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary.\nWe believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. We must assesses the promises within each sales contract to determine if they are distinct performance obligations. Once the performance obligation(s) are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation(s) based on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a sales contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not determinable, an estimate is used.\nA growing source of revenue is generated from digital product offerings, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated digital advertising solutions. When offering digital products, another party may be involved in providing the goods or services that make up a performance obligation to the customer. These include the use of third-party websites for social media campaigns. We must evaluate if we are the principal or agent in order to determine if revenue should be reported gross as principal or net as agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The determination of whether we control a specified good or service immediately prior to the good or service being transferred requires us to make reasonable judgments on the nature of each agreement. We have determined that we are acting as principal when we manage all aspects of a social media\ncampaign, including reviewing and approving target audiences, monitoring actual results and making modifications as needed and when we are responsible for delivering campaign results to our customers regardless of the use of a third-party or parties.\nTrade and Barter Transactions\nIn broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange air time or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter air time or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the air time or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.\nBroadcast Licenses, Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nApproximately 72% of our total assets at December 31, 2018 consisted of indefinite-lived intangible assets including broadcast licenses, goodwill and mastheads. These indefinite-lived intangible assets originated from acquisitions in which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill. We do not amortize indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year.\nImpairment testing requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as Level 3 inputs discussed in Note 12 of our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. These events and circumstances are not all-inclusive and are not by themselves indicators of impairment. We consider external and internal factors when reviewing the following events and circumstances, which are presented in the order of what we believe to be the strongest to weakest indicators of impairment:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> the difference between any recent fair value calculations and the carrying value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> financial performance, such as station operating income, including performance as compared to projected results used in prior estimates of fair value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> macroeconomic economic conditions, including limitations on accessing capital that could affect the discount rates used in prior estimates of fair value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> industry and market considerations such as a declines in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in demand, competition, or other economic factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> operating cost factors, such as increases in labor, that could have a negative effect on future expected earnings and cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management or customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> any changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we are required to perform a second step to preparing a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair or enterprise value of the assets. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to: limited trading volume, the impact of our publishing segment operating losses and the significant voting control of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of our quantitative review.\nIf the results of our quantitative analysis indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nBroadcast Licenses Impairment Testing\nThe unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results.\nThe first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We review the significant assumptions and key estimates applicable to our prior year estimated fair value calculations to assess if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect these assumptions and key estimates. We also review internal benchmarks and the economic performance for each market cluster to assess if it is more likely than not that impairment exists.\nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we calculate the excess fair value, or the amount by which our prior year estimated fair value exceeds the current year carrying value. Based on our analysis and review, including the financial performance of each market, we believe that a 25% excess fair value margin is a conservative and reasonable benchmark for our qualitative analysis. Markets with an excess fair value of 25% or more, which have had no significant changes in the prior year assumptions and key estimates, are not likely to be impaired.\nNext, we review the financial operating results for each market cluster. Radio stations are often sold on the basis of a multiple of projected cash flow, or Station Operating Income (\u201cSOI\u201d) defined as net broadcast revenue less\nbroadcast operating expenses. See Item 6 - Selected Financial Data within this annual report for information on SOI, a non-GAAP measure. Numerous trade organizations and analysts review these radio station sales to track SOI multiples applicable to each transaction. Based on published reports and an analysis of market transactions, we believe industry benchmarks to be in the six to seven times cash flow range. We elected an SOI benchmark of four as a conservative indicator of fair value. Markets with an SOI multiple of 4 or less, which have had no significant changes in the prior year assumptions and key estimates, are not likely to be impaired.\nThe second step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment if we have indication that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. The qualitative review includes markets that were not valued in the prior year as there is no basis to calculate the excess carrying value. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of this quantitative review.\nWhen performing a quantitative review of broadcast licenses, we estimate the fair value of each market cluster using the Greenfield Method, a form of the income approach. The premise of the Greenfield Method is that the value of a broadcast license is equivalent to a hypothetical start-up in which the only asset owned by the station as of the valuation date is the broadcast license. This approach eliminates factors that are unique to the operation of the station, including its format and historical financial performance. The method then assumes the entity has to purchase, build, or rent all of the other assets needed to operate a comparable station to the one in which the broadcast license is being utilized as of the valuation date. Cash flows are estimated and netted against all start-up costs, expenses and investments necessary to achieve a normalized and mature state of operations, thus reflecting only the cash flows directly attributable to the broadcast license. A multi-year discounted cash flow approach is then used to determine the net present value of these cash flows to derive an indication of fair value. For cash flows beyond the projection period, a terminal value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth model and long-term industry growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and Gross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) inflation rates.\nThe primary assumptions used in the Greenfield Method are:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> gross operating revenue in the station's designated market area;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> normalized market share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> normalized profit margin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> duration of the \u201cramp-up\u201d period to reach normalized operations, (which was assumed to be three years),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> estimated start-up costs (based on market size);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> ongoing replacement costs of fixed assets and working capital;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> amortization of the intangible asset, or the broadcast license.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions used reflect those of a hypothetical market participant and not necessarily the actual or projected results of Salem. The key estimates and assumptions used in the start-up income valuation for our broadcast licenses were as follows:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Broadcast Licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit margin ranges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(13.9%) - 30.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4% - 34.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% - 1.2% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\u201cWACC\u201d) developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nWhen performing our annual impairment testing for goodwill, the fair value of each applicable accounting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which is a form of the income approach. The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes a five to ten year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view. We make certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data, historical performance and our expectations of future performance. We also make assumptions regarding working capital requirements and ongoing capital expenditures for fixed assets. Future net free cash flows are calculated on a debt free basis and discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. The terminal year value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth method and long-term growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and GDP inflation rates. The resulting fair value estimates, net of any interest bearing debt, are then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit's net assets. Goodwill impairment testing may also use a cost approach, or the \u201cstick\u201d value of an entity or underlying assets. The stick value of a broadcast entity typically includes the carrying value of FCC licenses, tangible assets and working capital.\nThe first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets, including goodwill, are less than their carrying values. We review the significant inputs used in our prior year fair value estimates to determine if any changes to those inputs should be made. We estimate the fair value using a market approach and compare the estimated fair value of each entity to its carrying value, including goodwill. Under the market approach, we apply a multiple of four to each entities operating income to estimate the fair value. We believe that a multiple of four is a conservative indicator of fair value as described above.\nIf the results of our qualitative assessment indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value, we perform a second quantitative review of the reporting unit. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with determining the enterprise value as part of this quantitative review.\nGoodwill-Broadcast Markets\nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill associated with our radio stations is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. Seventeen of our 33 market clusters have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2018. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up.\nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Broadcast Markets Enterprise Valuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit margin ranges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8%) - 36.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.1%) - 45.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% - 1.1% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nGoodwill-Broadcast Networks\nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill in our radio networks is the entity level, which includes Salem Radio NetworkTM (\u201cSRNTM\u201d), Todays Christian Music (\u201cTCM\u201d) and Singing News\u00ae Radio. The entity level is\nthe level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available. One of our networks has goodwill associated with it as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2018. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up.\nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Broadcast Network Valuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit margin ranges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8% - 15.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nGoodwill - Digital Media\nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill in our digital media segment is the entity level, which includes SWN, SWN Spanish, Townhall.com\u00ae, Eagle Financial Publications and Newport National Health. The financial statements for SWN include the operating results and cash flows for our Christian content websites and our church product websites. The financial statements for Townhall.com\u00ae reflect the operating results for each of our conservative opinion websites. Eagle Financial Publications include our investing websites and related digital publications. The financial statements for Newport National Health include our e-commerce website. The entity level is the level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available. Four of our five digital entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2018. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up.\nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Media Enterprise Valuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit margin ranges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>8.0% - 36.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5% - 17.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% - 2.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nGoodwill-Publishing\nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill in our publishing segment is the entity level, which includes Regnery\u00ae Publishing, Salem Author Services and Singing News\u00ae. Regnery\u00ae Publishing is a book publisher based in Washington DC that operates from a stand-alone facility under one general manager, with operating results and cash flows of reported at the entity level. Salem Author Services operates from a stand-alone facility in Orlando, Florida under one general manager who is responsible for the operating results and cash flows. Singing News\u00ae produces and distributes a print magazine. The entity level is the level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available. Two of our publishing entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2018. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up.\nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows:\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Publishing Enterprise Valuations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin ranges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.0% - 5.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0% - 5.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nOther Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing\nMastheads consist of the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers. These include customized typeset page headers, section headers, and column graphics as well as other name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication. We are not aware of any legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our mastheads. We account for mastheads in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. We do not amortize mastheads, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year.\nWe test the value of mastheads at the publishing entity level, which is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. We print one magazine as of the testing period ended December 31, 2018 for which we have recorded masthead value.\nWhen performing a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair value of mastheads, the Relief from Royalty method is used. The Relief from Royalty method estimates the fair value of mastheads through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates a hypothetical \u201croyalty rate\u201d that a third-party owner would be willing to pay in lieu of owning the asset. The royalty rate is based on observed royalty rates for comparable assets as of the measurement date. We adjust the selected royalty rate to account for a percentage of the royalty fee that could be attributed to the use of other intangibles, such as goodwill, time in existence, trade secrets and industry expertise. The adjusted royalty rate represents the royalty fee remaining that could be attributed to the use of the masthead only.\nPre-tax royalty income is based on a 10-year revenue forecast and assumed to carry on into perpetuity. Revenue beyond the projection period (terminal year) is based on estimated long-term industry growth rates. The analysis also incorporated the present value of the tax amortization benefit associated with the mastheads. The key estimates and assumptions are as follows:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mastheads\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-adjusted discount rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(3.2%) - 0.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0%) - (1.0%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0% </td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.\nSensitivity of Key Broadcast Licenses, Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Assumptions\nWhen estimating the fair value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill, we make assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, operating cash flow margins and discount rates. These assumptions require substantial\njudgment, and actual rates and margins may differ materially. We prepared a sensitivity analysis of these assumptions and the hypothetical non-cash impairment charge that would have resulted if our estimates were to change by 100 basis points as of the testing period in the fourth quarter of 2018. The following would be the incremental impact:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sensitivity Analysis(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase in Risk-\nAdjusted Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease in Operating\nProfit Margins </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease in Long-Term\nRevenue Growth Rates </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incremental broadcast licenses impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incremental goodwill impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incremental Mastheads impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Each assumption used in the sensitivity analysis is independent of the other assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\u201cWACC\u201d) developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date. The same discount rate was used for each of our broadcast markets. The discount rate for our digital media and publishing entities was higher given the perceived additional risks associated with the cash flows in these businesses.\nOperating profit margin is defined as operating income before interest, depreciation, amortization, income tax and corporate allocation charges divided by net revenue. For the fair value analysis, the projections of operating profit margin that are used are based upon industry expectations. These margin projections are not specific to the performance of our radio stations or segments in a market, but are predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor. If actual future margins are lower than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nFor the goodwill fair value analysis, the projections of operating margin for each broadcast market and each entity are based on our historical performance. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nLong-term revenue growth rates are determined from publicly available information on industry expectations rather than our own estimates, which could differ. Long-term revenue growth rates can vary for each of our broadcast markets. Using industry expectations, each broadcast market, digital and publishing entity's revenues were forecasted over a ten-year projection period to reflect the projected long-term growth rate. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe account for property and equipment in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment. We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In accordance with authoritative guidance for impairment of long-lived assets, we must estimate the fair value of assets when events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets use significant observable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets, however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of long-lived assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations. The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Estimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill and any excess of fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued.\nAcquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts.\nA majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the FCC licenses to broadcast in a particular market. We often do not acquire the existing format, or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license. Under ASU 2017-01, that was effective on January 1, 2018, a fewer number of our radio station acquisitions will qualify as business acquisitions and instead be accounted for as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized.\nWe may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the acquisition date. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various asset categories in our financial statements. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that the purchase price allocations represent the appropriate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and we have not had to modify our purchase price allocations.\nWe estimate the economic life of each tangible and intangible asset acquired to determine the period of time in which the asset should be depreciated or amortized. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the economic life of each asset. We consider our own experience with similar assets, industry trends, market conditions and the age of the property at the time of our acquisition to estimate the economic life of each asset. If the financial condition of the assets were to deteriorate, the resulting change in life or impairment of the asset could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. To date, we have not experienced changes in the economic life established for each major category of our assets.\nContingent Earn-Out Consideration\nOur acquisitions often include contingent earn-out consideration as part of the purchase price. The fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date based on the present value of the\ncontingent payments expected to be made using a weighted probability of possible payments. The unobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration include our own assumptions about the likelihood of payment based on the established benchmarks and discount rates based on our internal rate of return analysis. The fair value measurements includes inputs that are Level 3 measurement as discussed in Note 12 in the notes of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in this annual report on Form 10-K .\nWe review the probabilities of possible future payments to the estimated fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results increase or decrease as compared to the assumption used in our analysis, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration obligations will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. During the year ended December 31 2018, we recognized a net increase of $76,000 to our estimated contingent earn-out liabilities as compared to a net decrease to our estimated contingent earn-out liabilities of $23,000 for the same period of the prior year. The changes in our estimates reflect volatility from variables, such as revenue growth, page views and session time as discussed in Note 4-Contingent Earn-Out Consideration in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of all remaining contingent earn-out consideration however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions.\nFair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and requires expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This includes applying the fair value concept to (i) nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations; (ii) reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing; (iii) other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments; and (iv) asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.\nThe fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasize that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price. If we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate.\nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less (or no) pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.\nFASB ASC Topic 820 established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value\nmeasurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as follows:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1 Inputs-quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2 Inputs-inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3 Inputs-unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity's own data).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our financial assets as discussed in Note 12 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nContingency Reserves\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe record contingency reserves to the extent we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the subjective judgment of management. The reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\nWhile we believe that the final resolution of any known maters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is possible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that can result in the diversion of significant operational resources.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe evaluate the balance reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis based on our historical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all of our collection efforts have been unsuccessful, including use of a collections agency. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\nSales Returns and Allowances\nWe provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return, primarily book sales associated with Regnery\u00ae Publishing and nutritional products sold through our wellness division. We record an estimate of these product returns as a reduction of revenue in the period of the sale. Our estimates are based upon historical sales returns, the amount of current period sales, economic trends and any changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. We regularly monitor actual performance to estimated return rates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience. However, actual returns may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories consist of finished goods, including published books and wellness products. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) cost method. We reviewed historical data associated with book and wellness product inventories held by Regnery\u00ae Publishing and our e-commerce wellness entities, as well as our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes a review of actual sales returns, our allowances, royalty reserves, overall economic conditions and product demand. We record a provision to expense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either favorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\nReserves for Royalty Advances\nRoyalties due to book authors are paid in advance and capitalized. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenues are earned or when we determine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We reviewed historical data associated with royalty advances, earnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery\u00ae Publishing. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will recover the advance through the sale of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. A provision was established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe is not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue publication of a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\nFair Value of Equity Awards\nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. We record equity awards with stock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of each award using the Black-Scholes valuation model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the award granted. The exercise price for each award is equal to or greater than the closing market price of Salem Media Group, Inc. common stock as of the date of the award. We use the straight-line attribution\nmethod to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of the award, deferred tax assets for awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award. We have not modified our estimates or assumptions used in our valuation model. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our stock based compensation is accurately reflected in our results of operations.\nPartial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan\nWe provide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits. We record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual amount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future reserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.8 million and $0.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes)\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by tax authorities. Reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities are established if necessary. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax implications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.\nFor financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to offset the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some\npositions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.\nWe review and reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not recognize liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we have no liabilities for uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2018. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2014 through 2017. There is currently one tax examination in process. The City of New York began their audit of Salem's 2013 and 2014 tax filings. We do not anticipate any material or significant results from the audit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal sources of funds have been operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of selected assets or businesses. We have historically funded, and will continue to fund, expenditures for operations, administrative expenses, and capital expenditures from these sources. We have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings, including borrowings under credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, from operating cash flow and from proceeds on selected asset dispositions. We expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings. We have assessed the current and expected economic outlook and our current and expected needs for funds and we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our working capital deficit at December 31, 2018.\nGenerally, we keep the balance of cash and cash equivalents low in order to reduce the balance of outstanding debt. Our ABL Facility automatically covers any shortfalls in operating cash flows such that we are not required to hold excess cash balances on hand. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $0.1 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $3,000 at December 31, 2017. Our working capital decreased by $13.8 million to ($9.2) million at December 31, 2018 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2017 reflecting a $10.6 million increase in the outstanding balance on the ABL Facility, a $3.5 million decrease in assets held for sale, and a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses including a $0.2 million increase in accrued music license fees, a $0.2 million increase in acquisition-related deferred payments, a $0.1 million increase in accrued legal fees and a $0.1 million increase in third-party marketing costs.\nOperating Cash Flows\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows are receipts from customers in exchange for advertising and programming. Other sources of operating cash inflows include receipts from customers for digital downloads and streaming, book sales, subscriptions, self-publishing fees, ticket sales, sponsorships, and vendor promotions. A majority of our operating cash outflows consist of payments to employees, such as salaries and benefits, and vendor payments under facility and tower leases, talent agreements, inventory purchases and recurring services\nsuch as utilities and music license fees. Our operating cash flows are subject to factors such as fluctuations in preferred advertising media and changes in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, and audience tastes. In addition, our operating cash flows may be affected if our customers are unable to pay, delay payment of amounts owed to us, or if we experience reductions in revenue, or increases in costs and expenses.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $4.4 million to $23.0 million from $27.4 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the following items:\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Total net revenue declined by $1.0 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Operating expenses exclusive of depreciation, amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, and impairments increased by $0.8 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Trade accounts receivables, net of allowances, increased by $0.5 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Unbilled revenue increased $0.2 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Our Day's Sales Outstanding, or the average number of days to collect cash from the date of sale, decreased to 60 days at December 31, 2018 compared to 65 days at December 31, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Net accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $1.4 million to $19.9 million from $18.5 million as of the prior year including a $0.2 million increase in accrued music license fees, $0.2 million increase in deferred payments, $0.1 million increase in accrued legal fees, and a $0.1 million increase in third party marketing costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Net inventories on hand decreased $53,000 to $677,000 at December 31, 2018 compared to an increase of $0.1 million to $730,000 at December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Investing Cash Flows\nOur primary source of investing cash inflows includes proceeds from the disposition of assets or businesses. Our investing cash outflows include cash payments made to acquire businesses, to acquire property and equipment and to acquire intangible assets such as domain names. While our focus continues to be on deleveraging the company, we remain committed to explore and pursue strategic acquisitions.\nIn recent years, our acquisition agreements have contained contingent earn-out arrangements that are payable in the future based on the achievement of predefined operating results. We believe that these contingent earn-out arrangements provide some degree of protection with regard to our cash outflows should these acquisitions not meet our operational expectations.\nWe plan to fund future purchases and any acquisitions from cash on hand, operating cash flow or our credit facilities.\nWe undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses, expand our digital and web-based offerings, improve our facilities and upgrade our computer infrastructures. The nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management. Based on our current plans, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $7.5 million during 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.4 million to $10.7 million compared to $10.3 million during the prior year. The increase in cash used for investing activities includes:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash paid for acquisitions increased $6.9 million to $10.9 million compared to $4.0 million during the prior year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Cash paid for capital expenditures increased $0.8 million to $9.3 million compared to $8.5 million during the prior year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We received $9.9 million in proceeds from the sale of radio station WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) in Miami, Florida, radio station KGBI-FM in Omaha, Nebraska, radio station WBIX-AM in Boston, Massachusetts, radio stations KOTK-AM and KCRO-AM in Omaha, Nebraska, sale of land in Lakeside Valley, California, and the sale of land in Covina, California.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Financing Cash Flows\nFinancing cash inflows include borrowings under our credit facilities and any proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock incentive plan. Financing cash outflows include repayments of our credit facilities, the payment of equity distributions and payments of amounts due under deferred installments and contingency earn-out consideration associated with acquisition activity.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2018, the principal balances outstanding under the Notes and ABL Facility ranged from $249.5 million to $264.0 million. These outstanding balances were ordinary and customary based on our operating and investing cash needs during this time.\nAny future equity distributions are likely to be comparable to prior declarations unless there are changes in expected future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements. Based on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock currently outstanding we expect to pay total annual equity distributions of approximately $6.8 million in 2019. However, the actual declaration of dividends and equity distributions, as well as the establishment of per share amounts, dates of record, and payment dates are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors and depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other factors.\nOur sole source of cash available for making any future equity distributions is our operating cash flow, subject to our credit facilities and Notes, which contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends and equity distributions unless certain specified conditions are satisfied.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $5.0 million to $12.1 million compared to $17.1 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities includes:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> A $7.0 million decrease in cash paid for debt issuance costs due to the credit agreements entered in the prior year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> A $2.9 million decrease in the book overdraft to $0.3 million from $3.2 million of the prior year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We used $15.4 million of cash to repurchase $16.4 million in face value of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The impact of the $8.0 million net cash used in 2017 to repay the Term Loan B of $263.0 million and issue the Notes for $255.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Salem Media Group, Inc. has no independent assets or operations, the subsidiary guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of Salem Media Group, Inc. other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor.\n6.75% Senior Secured Notes\nOn May 19, 2017, we issued in a private placement the Notes, which are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the \u201cSubsidiary Guarantors\u201d). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and\nmature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.\nThe Notes and the ABL Facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our and the Subsidiary Guarantors' assets, other than certain excluded assets. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the Subsidiary Guarantors' accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the \u201cABL Priority Collateral\u201d). The Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all other assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors (the \u201cNotes Priority Collateral\u201d). There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation.\nWe may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2020, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes before June 1, 2020 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.75% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. We may also redeem up to 10% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Notes per twelve-month period before June 1, 2020 at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.\nThe indenture relating to the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets.\nThe Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d): (i) default in payment of principal or premium on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least $15 million; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (vii) certain defaults with respect to any collateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of the Notes and any accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.\nBased on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $15.9 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31, 2018, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.3 million.\nWe incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the debt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.\nWe may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions warrant.\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at amounts less than face value as follows:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Principal\nRepurchased </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash\nPaid </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Face\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Bond Issue\nCosts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Gain </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 21, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 21, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 21, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>November 17, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>May 4, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 10, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 9, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility\nOn May 19, 2017, the Company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) by and among us and our subsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the Notes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.\nThe ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due May 19, 2022, which includes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a spread. The spread, which is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR rate borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings.\nThe ABL Facility is secured by a first-priority lien on the ABL Priority Collateral and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral. There is no direct lien on the Company's FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).\nThe Credit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold amount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict the ability of the borrowers and their subsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell assets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal or letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or any other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made; (iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral.\nWe incurred debt issue costs of $0.7 million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $0.2 million of debt issue costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2018, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 4.45%.\nWe report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and customary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nPrior Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility\nOur prior credit facility consisted of a term loan of $300.0 million (\u201cTerm Loan B\u201d) and a revolving credit facility of $25.0 million (\u201cRevolver\u201d). The Term Loan B was issued at a discount for total net proceeds of $298.5 million. The discount was amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $74,000 of the discount associated with the Term Loan B was amortized to interest expense.\nThe Term Loan B had a term of seven years, maturing in March 2020. On May 19, 2017, we used the net proceeds of the Notes and a portion of the ABL Facility to fully repay amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B of $258.0 million and under the Revolver of $4.1 million. We recorded a pre-tax loss on the early retirement of long-term debt of $2.1 million, which included $1.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs on the Term Loan B and the Revolver and $0.6 million of unamortized discount on the Term Loan B.\nThe following payments or prepayments of the Term Loan B were made during the year ended December 31, 2017 through the date of the termination, including interest through the payment date as follows:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Paid </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unamortized Discount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 19, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 28, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Debt issuance costs were amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Term Loan B using the effective interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2017 approximately $203,000 of the debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan B was amortized to interest expense.\nDebt issuance costs associated with the Revolver were recorded as an asset in accordance with ASU 2015-15. The costs were amortized to non-cash interest expense over the five year life of the Revolver using the effective interest method based on an imputed interest rate of 4.58%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $26,000.\nSummary of long-term debt obligations\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>255,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,570 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less unamortized debt issuance costs based on imputed interest rate of 7.08%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,774 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,540 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6.75% Senior Secured Notes net carrying value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,030 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility principal outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases and other loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and capital lease obligations less unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,109 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,718 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and capital lease obligations less unamortized debt issuance costs, net of current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding borrowings of $19.7 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR rate borrowings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> $238.6 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 6.75%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Debt\nWe have several capital leases related to office equipment.

We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset over its fair value. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses.\nDuring our annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $2.9 million impairment charge of broadcast licenses and $36,000 impairment of mastheads. We determined that the carrying value of broadcast licenses in three of our market clusters were impaired as of the annual testing period ending December 31, 2018. We recorded an impairment charge of $2.8 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Cleveland, Louisville and Portland. The impairment charge was driven by a decrease in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the broadcast industry. The masthead impairment charge was driven by decreases in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the print magazine industry.\nWe believe that our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses, mastheads, and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets, and our estimates incorporate variables and assumptions that are based on past experiences and judgment about future operating performance of our markets and business segments. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The fair value measurements for our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 12.\nThe valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations. The fair value measurements of our indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. Given the current economic environment and uncertainties that can negatively impact our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of our indefinite-lived intangible fair value estimates will prove to be accurate.\nWhile the impairment charges we have recognized are non-cash in nature and did not violate the covenants on the then existing Revolver and Term Loan B, the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows. We believe that we have adequately considered the potential for an economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non-cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nNot required for smaller

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGeneral\nSalem Media Group, Inc. (\u201cSalem\u201d) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable from period to period due to acquisitions and dispositions. Refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for details of each of these transactions.\nHistorical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Actual future results may differ from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the need for additional funds to service our debt and to execute our business strategy, our ability to access borrowings under our ABL Facility, reductions in revenue forecasts, our ability to renew our broadcast licenses, changes in interest rates, the timing of, our ability to complete any acquisitions or dispositions, costs and synergies resulting from the integration of any completed acquisitions, our ability to effectively manage costs, our ability to drive and manage growth, the popularity of radio as a broadcasting and advertising medium, changes in consumer tastes, the impact of general economic conditions in the United States or in specific markets in which we do business, industry conditions, including existing competition and future competitive technologies and cancellation, disruptions or postponements of advertising schedules in response to national or world events, our ability to generate revenues from new sources, including local commerce and technology-based initiatives, the impact of regulatory rules or proceedings that may affect our business from time to time, and the future write off of any material portion of the fair value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill,\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOverview\nWe have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.\nWe measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.\nOur principal sources of broadcast revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of block program time to national and local program producers; \n \u2022 the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers; \n \u2022 the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \u2022 fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through Salem Surround; \n \u2022 the sale of advertising time on our national network; \n \u2022 the syndication of programming on our national network; \n \u2022 product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts and programs; and \n \u2022 other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue is generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and rental income for studios, towers or office space.  Our principal sources of digital media revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications; \n \u2022 the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites; \n \u2022 the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \u2022 the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; \n \u2022 the number of video and graphic downloads; and \n \u2022 the sale and delivery of wellness products. \nOur principal sources of publishing revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of books and e-books; \n \u2022 publishing fees from authors; \n \u2022 the sale of digital advertising on our magazine websites and digital newsletters; \n \u2022 subscription fees for our print magazine; and \n \u2022 the sale of print magazine advertising. \nIn each of our operating segments, the rates we are able to charge for air-time, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors, including:\n \u2022 audience share; \n \u2022 how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients; \n \u2022 the size of the market and audience reached; \n \u2022 the number of impressions delivered; \n \u2022 the number of advertisements and programs streamed; \n \u2022 the number of page views achieved; \n \u2022 the number of downloads completed; \n \u2022 the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event; \n \u2022 demand for books and publications; \n \u2022 general economic conditions; and \n \u2022 supply and demand for air-time on a local and national level.  Broadcasting\nOur foundational business is radio broadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of our broadcasting operations.\nRevenues generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms are reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this quarterly report on Form 10-K. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.\nBroadcast revenues are impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations' ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks' ability to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio, which develops quarterly reports measuring a radio station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time available for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.\nNielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (\u201cPPM\u201d) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter time periods between when advertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the PPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the \u201cpanel\u201d (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time.\nAs is typical in the radio broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising during election years by way of political advertisements. During election years, or even numbered years, we benefit from a significant increase in political advertising revenue over non-election or odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues. Quarterly block programming revenue tends not to vary significantly because program rates are generally set annually and recognized on a per program basis.\nOur cash flows from broadcasting are affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period, when we develop a radio station's listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.\nIn broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange air time or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter air time or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the air time or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 97% of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash as compared to 98% during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBroadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities.\nDigital Media\nWeb-based and digital content continues to be a focus of future development. Our digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing and health-themed content, e-commerce, audio and video streaming, and other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Digital media revenues are impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our broadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product sites. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold associated with e-commerce sites.\nPublishing\nOur publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery\u00ae Publishing, a print magazine and our self-publishing services. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Publishing revenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print magazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery\u00ae Publishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our Publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nBroadcast revenue growth remains challenged, which we believe is due to several factors, including increasing competition from other forms of content distribution and time spent listening by audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. This increase in competition and mix of radio listening time may lead advertisers to conclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that provide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.\nOur broadcast revenues are particularly dependent on our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 12.0% and 10.4%, respectively, of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription revenues, are challenged both economically and by the increasing use of other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors. Because digital media has been a growth area for us, decreases in digital revenue streams could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views. We have experienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page which are generally sold at lower rates. Digital media revenue is impacted by page views and the number of advertisements per page. Declines in desktop page views impact revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to cross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.\nWe may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, seek to renew or renegotiate lease terms under a \u201cblend and extend\u201d option that we believe provides us with favorable lease terms over an extended period from five to twenty years. As rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, we expect our lease expense to increase by approximately $0.6 million over future periods. Actual cash payments for leased properties are expected to remain consistent with annual increases of up to 3% or a percentage of the Consumer Price Index.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators-Same-Station Definition\nIn the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an as-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies Refer to \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station results for each of the four quarters of that year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.\nOur presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nItem 101 of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain non-GAAP financial information may be presented in this report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (\u201cSOI\u201d), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses, Same Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nThe performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. SOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews associated with impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. SOI does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each\nquarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four quarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net digital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Income is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal review. This measurement does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the disposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before impairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFor all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial performance, develop budgets, manage expenditures, and determine employee compensation. Our presentation of this additional information is not to be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and broadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of Station Operating Income and Same\nStation Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in the table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss). Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nIn the table below, we present our calculations of Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income. Our presentation of these non-GAAP performance indicators are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\n In the table below, we present a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss). Our presentation of these non-GAAP performance indicators are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn the table below, we present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial performance measures that are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following factors affected our results of operations and our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year:\nFinancing\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of the Notes at amounts less than face value as follows during the year ended December 31, 2018:\n\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions\n \u2022 On September 11, 2018, we acquired radio station KTRB-AM in San Francisco for $5.1 million in cash from a related party. We operated the radio station under an LMA that began on June 24, 2016. \n \u2022 On August 28, 2018, we closed on the sale of radio station WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) in Miami, Florida for $3.5 million in cash. \n \u2022 On August 9, 2018, we acquired the Hilary Kramer Financial Newsletter and related assets valued at $2.0 million and we assumed deferred subscription liabilities valued at $1.5 million. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon closing and may pay up to an additional $0.1 million of contingent earn-out consideration over the next two years based on the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks as part of the purchase agreement. Using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model based on our own assumptions as to the ability of the Hilary Kramer Financial Newsletter to achieve the income targets at the time of closing, we estimated the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration to be $40,617, which was recorded at the discounted present value of $39,360. The discount will be accreted to interest expense over the two year earn-out period. \n \u2022 On August 7, 2018, we acquired the Just1Word mobile applications and related assets for $0.3 million in cash upon closing. We may pay up to an additional $0.1 million of contingent earn-out consideration over the next two years based on the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks as part of the purchase agreement. Using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model based on our own assumptions as to the ability of Just1Word to achieve the income targets at the time of closing, we estimated the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration to be $12,750, which was recorded at the discounted present value of $12,212. The discount will be accreted to interest expense over the two year earn-out period. \n \u2022 On August 6, 2018, we closed on the sale of radio station KGBI-FM in Omaha, Nebraska for $3.2 million \n \u2022 On July 25, 2018, we acquired radio station KZTS-AM (formerly KDXE-AM) and an FM Translator in Little Rock, Arkansas for $0.2 million in cash. The radio station is currently operated under an LMA agreement with another party and is not reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 On July 24, 2018, we acquired the Childrens-Ministry-Deals.com website and related assets for $3.7 million in cash. We paid $3.5 million in cash upon closing and may pay an additional $0.2 million in cash within twelve months from the closing date provided that the seller meet certain post-closing requirements with regard to intellectual property. \n \u2022 On June 25, 2018, we acquired radio station KDXE-FM (formerly KZTS-FM) in Little Rock, Arkansas for $1.1 million in cash. We programmed the station under an LMA as of April 1, 2018. \n \u2022 On June 28, 2018, we closed on the sale of land in Lakeside, California for $0.3 million in cash. \n \u2022 On June 20, 2018, we closed on the sale of radio station WBIX-AM in Boston, Massachusetts for $0.7 million in cash. \n \u2022 On May 24, 2018, we closed on the sale of land in Covina, California for $0.8 million resulting in a $0.2 million pre-tax loss. \n \u2022 On April 30, 2018, we ceased programming radio station KHTE-FM, in Little Rock, Arkansas. We programmed the station under a Time Brokerage Agreement (\u201cTBA\u201d) beginning on April 1, 2015. We had the option to acquire the station for $1.2 million in cash during the TBA period. We paid the licensee a $0.1 million fee for not exercising our purchase option for the station. \n \u2022 On April 19, 2018, we acquired the HearItFirst.com domain name and related social media assets for $70,000 in cash. \n \u2022 On January 2, 2018, we began programming radio stations KPAM-AM and KKOV-AM in Portland, Oregon under Local Marketing Agreements (\u201cLMAs\u201d) entered on December 29, 2017, with original terms of up to 12 months. The LMAs terminated on March 30, 2018 when the radio stations were sold to another party. We entered a second LMA with the new owner as of the closing date under which we continue to program radio station KPAM-AM \nNet Broadcast Revenue\n The following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net broadcast revenue for each broadcast revenue source.\n The net decline in block programming revenue of $0.4 million reflects a $1.6 million decline in local programming revenue that was offset by a $1.2 million increase in national programming revenue. Declines in local programming revenue include $0.9 million from WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) that was operated under an LMA as of December 1, 2017 through the sale of the station on August 28, 2018, and $0.7 million from program cancellations that we believe are due to increased competition from other broadcasters and from the loss of broadcast customers to digital. The increase in national programming revenue includes a $1.2 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations due to an increase in the number of programmers featured on-air that creates a higher demand for premium time slots. This higher demand for premium time slots often results in realization of higher rates. Annual renewals reflect a low single digit average rate increase with 95% of our programmers renewing. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million decline in programming from our Business format radio stations that restrict content to ensure compliance with securities rules and regulations and a $0.2 million decline in programming from all other formats.\nTotal advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, increased by $63,000 on a consolidated basis, which includes a $1.9 million increase in political advertising as compared to the same period of the prior year. Political\nrevenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years. Excluding political, advertising revenue declined by a net $1.9 million including a $3.6 million decline in local advertising offset by a $1.7 million increase in national advertising. Declines in local advertising, net of political, include a $2.2 million decline from our CCM format radio stations that were largely attributable to declines in the spot rate charged due to competition from other broadcasters that offer lower rates primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, a $1.1 million decline from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and $0.1 million from our Business News format radio stations, all reflecting the loss of broadcast advertisers to digital. Additionally, $0.4 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station KGBI-FM in Omaha, Nebraska and $0.3 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station WQVN-AM in Miami, Florida. These declines in local advertising were offset by a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations reflecting the addition of KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon that we began programming in April of 2018. The $1.7 million increase in national advertising, net of political, includes a $1.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations primarily in our Dallas and Atlanta markets and a $0.1 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. These increases, particularly from our CCM format stations, reflect the impact of higher ratings achieved in the current year as compared to the prior year that creates an increase in demand for air-time. This increase in demand can result in higher rates.\nLocal digital revenue, or that which is generated from our radio stations and networks increased $1.5 million, including a $0.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations, a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. During 2018, we launched Salem Surround, a national multimedia advertising agency. We continue to expand our digital product offerings to include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted advertising and other services to address the move of advertising dollars from broadcast to digital. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nDeclines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number of infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the infomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.\nNetwork revenue increased by $1.2 million of which $1.4 million was due to an increase in political advertising revenue and $0.3 million was generated from donor development campaigns that were offset by a $0.5 million decrease in national advertising revenue due to lower spot rates as a result of higher competition from other national broadcasters and agencies. Political revenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years.\nOther revenue increased $0.4 million including a $0.2 million increase in LMA fees associated with radio stations WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM), Miami, Florida, and WBIX-AM, Boston Massachusetts, a $0.2 million increase in sponsorship revenue and a $0.2 million increase in broadcast tower rental fees, offset by a $0.2 million decline in event revenue due to a reduction in the number of events held and a $0.1 million decline in listener purchasing program revenue. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of the events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather that can affect attendance.\nOn a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue increased $3.5 million, which reflects these items net of the impact of stations with acquisitions, dispositions and format changes.\nNet Digital Media Revenue\n\nThe following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of national net digital media revenue, or revenue generated from our websites and digital subscriptions, for each digital media revenue source.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGeneral\nSalem Media Group, Inc.

The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are not directly comparable from period to period due to acquisitions and dispositions. Refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for details of each of these transactions.\nHistorical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Actual future results may differ from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the need for additional funds to service our debt and to execute our business strategy, our ability to access borrowings under our ABL Facility, reductions in revenue forecasts, our ability to renew our broadcast licenses, changes in interest rates, the timing of, our ability to complete any acquisitions or dispositions, costs and synergies resulting from the integration of any completed acquisitions, our ability to effectively manage costs, our ability to drive and manage growth, the popularity of radio as a broadcasting and advertising medium, changes in consumer tastes, the impact of general economic conditions in the United States or in specific markets in which we do business, industry conditions, including existing competition and future competitive technologies and cancellation, disruptions or postponements of advertising schedules in response to national or world events, our ability to generate revenues from new sources, including local commerce and technology-based initiatives, the impact of regulatory rules or proceedings that may affect our business from time to time, and the future write off of any material portion of the fair value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill,\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOverview\nWe have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.\nWe measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.\nOur principal sources of broadcast revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of block program time to national and local program producers; \n \u2022 the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers; \n \u2022 the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \u2022 fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through Salem Surround; \n \u2022 the sale of advertising time on our national network; \n \u2022 the syndication of programming on our national network; \n \u2022 product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts and programs; and \n \u2022 other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue is generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and rental income for studios, towers or office space.  Our principal sources of digital media revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications; \n \u2022 the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications; \n \u2022 the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites; \n \u2022 the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \u2022 the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; \n \u2022 the number of video and graphic downloads; and \n \u2022 the sale and delivery of wellness products. \nOur principal sources of publishing revenue include:\n \u2022 the sale of books and e-books; \n \u2022 publishing fees from authors; \n \u2022 the sale of digital advertising on our magazine websites and digital newsletters; \n \u2022 subscription fees for our print magazine; and \n \u2022 the sale of print magazine advertising. \nIn each of our operating segments, the rates we are able to charge for air-time, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors, including:\n \u2022 audience share; \n \u2022 how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients; \n \u2022 the size of the market and audience reached; \n \u2022 the number of impressions delivered; \n \u2022 the number of advertisements and programs streamed; \n \u2022 the number of page views achieved; \n \u2022 the number of downloads completed; \n \u2022 the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event; \n \u2022 demand for books and publications; \n \u2022 general economic conditions; and \n \u2022 supply and demand for air-time on a local and national level.  Broadcasting\nOur foundational business is radio broadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of our broadcasting operations.\nRevenues generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms are reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this quarterly report on Form 10-K. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.\nBroadcast revenues are impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations' ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks' ability to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio, which develops quarterly reports measuring a radio station's audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time available for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.\nNielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (\u201cPPM\u201d) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter time periods between when advertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the PPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the \u201cpanel\u201d (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time.\nAs is typical in the radio broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising during election years by way of political advertisements. During election years, or even numbered years, we benefit from a significant increase in political advertising revenue over non-election or odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues. Quarterly block programming revenue tends not to vary significantly because program rates are generally set annually and recognized on a per program basis.\nOur cash flows from broadcasting are affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period, when we develop a radio station's listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.\nIn broadcasting, trade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange air time or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter air time or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the air time or digital campaign for cash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 97% of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash as compared to 98% during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBroadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities.\nDigital Media\nWeb-based and digital content continues to be a focus of future development. Our digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing and health-themed content, e-commerce, audio and video streaming, and other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Digital media revenues are impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our broadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product sites. Additionally, we experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold associated with e-commerce sites.\nPublishing\nOur publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery\u00ae Publishing, a print magazine and our self-publishing services. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations.\nRevenues generated from this segment are reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Publishing revenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print magazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery\u00ae Publishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions.\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our Publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as rent and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nBroadcast revenue growth remains challenged, which we believe is due to several factors, including increasing competition from other forms of content distribution and time spent listening by audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. This increase in competition and mix of radio listening time may lead advertisers to conclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that provide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.\nOur broadcast revenues are particularly dependent on our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 12.0% and 10.4%, respectively, of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription revenues, are challenged both economically and by the increasing use of other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors. Because digital media has been a growth area for us, decreases in digital revenue streams could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views. We have experienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page which are generally sold at lower rates. Digital media revenue is impacted by page views and the number of advertisements per page. Declines in desktop page views impact revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to cross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.\nWe may from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, seek to renew or renegotiate lease terms under a \u201cblend and extend\u201d option that we believe provides us with favorable lease terms over an extended period from five to twenty years. As rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, we expect our lease expense to increase by approximately $0.6 million over future periods. Actual cash payments for leased properties are expected to remain consistent with annual increases of up to 3% or a percentage of the Consumer Price Index.\nKey Financial Performance Indicators-Same-Station Definition\nIn the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an as-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies Refer to \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station results for each of the four quarters of that year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.\nOur presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nItem 101 of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain non-GAAP financial information may be presented in this report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (\u201cSOI\u201d), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses, Same Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nThe performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. SOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews associated with impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. SOI does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses from our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each\nquarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four quarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net digital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Income is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal review. This measurement does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the disposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before impairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFor all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial performance, develop budgets, manage expenditures, and determine employee compensation. Our presentation of this additional information is not to be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and broadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of Station Operating Income and Same\nStation Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in the table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income (Loss).

in local programming revenue that was offset by a $1.2 million increase in national programming revenue. Declines in local programming revenue include $0.9 million from WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) that was operated under an LMA as of December 1, 2017 through the sale of the station on August 28, 2018, and $0.7 million from program cancellations that we believe are due to increased competition from other broadcasters and from the loss of broadcast customers to digital. The increase in national programming revenue includes a $1.2 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations due to an increase in the number of programmers featured on-air that creates a higher demand for premium time slots. This higher demand for premium time slots often results in realization of higher rates. Annual renewals reflect a low single digit average rate increase with 95% of our programmers renewing. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million decline in programming from our Business format radio stations that restrict content to ensure compliance with securities rules and regulations and a $0.2 million decline in programming from all other formats.\nTotal advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, increased by $63,000 on a consolidated basis, which includes a $1.9 million increase in political advertising as compared to the same period of the prior year. Political\nrevenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years. Excluding political, advertising revenue declined by a net $1.9 million including a $3.6 million decline in local advertising offset by a $1.7 million increase in national advertising. Declines in local advertising, net of political, include a $2.2 million decline from our CCM format radio stations that were largely attributable to declines in the spot rate charged due to competition from other broadcasters that offer lower rates primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, a $1.1 million decline from our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations and $0.1 million from our Business News format radio stations, all reflecting the loss of broadcast advertisers to digital. Additionally, $0.4 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station KGBI-FM in Omaha, Nebraska and $0.3 million of the decline resulted from the sale of radio station WQVN-AM in Miami, Florida. These declines in local advertising were offset by a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations reflecting the addition of KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon that we began programming in April of 2018. The $1.7 million increase in national advertising, net of political, includes a $1.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations primarily in our Dallas and Atlanta markets and a $0.1 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. These increases, particularly from our CCM format stations, reflect the impact of higher ratings achieved in the current year as compared to the prior year that creates an increase in demand for air-time. This increase in demand can result in higher rates.\nLocal digital revenue, or that which is generated from our radio stations and networks increased $1.5 million, including a $0.5 million increase from our CCM format radio stations, a $0.5 million increase from our News Talk format radio stations and a $0.3 million increase from our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations. During 2018, we launched Salem Surround, a national multimedia advertising agency. We continue to expand our digital product offerings to include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted advertising and other services to address the move of advertising dollars from broadcast to digital. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nDeclines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number of infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the same period of the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the infomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.\nNetwork revenue increased by $1.2 million of which $1.4 million was due to an increase in political advertising revenue and $0.3 million was generated from donor development campaigns that were offset by a $0.5 million decrease in national advertising revenue due to lower spot rates as a result of higher competition from other national broadcasters and agencies. Political revenues reflect the current (even) year election period and are typically not as significant during non-election (odd) years.\nOther revenue increased $0.4 million including a $0.2 million increase in LMA fees associated with radio stations WQVN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM), Miami, Florida, and WBIX-AM, Boston Massachusetts, a $0.2 million increase in sponsorship revenue and a $0.2 million increase in broadcast tower rental fees, offset by a $0.2 million decline in event revenue due to a reduction in the number of events held and a $0.1 million decline in listener purchasing program revenue. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of the events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather that can affect attendance.\nOn a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue increased $3.5 million, which reflects these items net of the impact of stations with acquisitions, dispositions and format changes.\nNet Digital Media Revenue\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Digital Media Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(501 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of national net digital media revenue, or revenue generated from our websites and digital subscriptions, for each digital media revenue source.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Advertising, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Streaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Subscriptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Downloads\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> e-commerce\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td>"}
