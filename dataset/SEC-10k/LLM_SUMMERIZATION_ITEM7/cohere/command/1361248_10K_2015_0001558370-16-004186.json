MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward- looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics in oncology, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates in development: birinapant and SHAPE. In May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, clinical trial, and in January 2016 we terminated the birinapant myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, clinical trial due to disappointing results in the trial. We have, however, applied to re-commence the HBV clinical trial in India and our application is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. We are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nIn January 2016, our board of directors authorized a reduction in our staff which we expect to complete in the first half of 2016. Our Chief Scientific Officer and our Chief Operating Officer are included in those reductions. Following the reduction, we will have only nine remaining employees. In connection with these reductions, we expect to incur a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $2.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2016, which may increase later in the year, depending on potential facility-related charges and other write-downs that have not yet been finalized.\nOn January 20, 2016, we were notified by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum market value listing requirements of the exchange and that we have until July 18, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. On February 23, 2016, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of the exchange and that we have until August 22, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. We are currently considering available options to regain compliance.\nOn January 28, 2016, we announced that we retained Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., as our financial advisor, to provide financial advisory, restructuring and investment banking services in connection with analyzing and considering a wide range of transactional and strategic alternatives. We are currently focusing on our clinical programs and exploring various alternatives, but can give no assurance that our clinical programs will yield any commercially viable product or that a transaction of any kind will occur.\nSHAPE is our proprietary histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor that we are developing for topical use for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, and we are exploring studying SHAPE in alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. SHAPE has been granted U.S. orphan drug designation for CTCL. CTCL is a form of non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma which primarily manifests in the skin. The majority of CTCL cases are indolent; however, there are rare cases of CTCL that are aggressive and life-threatening. HDAC is a validated cancer target, and HDAC inhibitors, or HDACi, are a proven class of anti-cancer drugs for CTCL. SHAPE is a novel therapeutic, designed to maximize HDAC inhibition locally in the skin with limited systemic exposure, and it has characteristics that could allow its topical use over large body surface areas with minimal systemic absorption. By potentially avoiding toxicities typical of systemically-administered HDACi's, SHAPE may provide a more favorable safety profile than current HDACi's delivered orally or intravenously. SHAPE has been evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in early-stage CTCL. SHAPE was well-tolerated, and it demonstrated evidence of clinical activity with partial responses, or PRs, observed in certain subjects after 28 days of application.\nOn January 6, 2016, we announced that we had undertaken an interim analysis of our randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE. The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of three different dosing regimens of SHAPE in patients suffering from earlier stage CTCL. All patients in the clinical trial had received prior therapy either in the form of topical steroids, UV light therapy, topical nitrogen mustard, or some other agent. Twenty-eight of 34 patients were evaluable for response at the six month time point. After six months of treatment, eight of 34 patients exhibited a response to treatment as assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity, or CAILS, the primary endpoint, and a further 18 had stable disease. Using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, or mSWAT, a secondary endpoint in the clinical trial, 11 of 34 patients responded and a further 14 patients had stable disease at the six month endpoint.\nThe interim results taken during this Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that SHAPE also showed improvement in pruritus (itch), a significant symptom associated with CTCL. Thirty-eight percent of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful decrease in pruritus during the clinical trial as measured by a Visual Analog Scale. SHAPE was well tolerated by patients in the clinical trial. The 60 patient clinical trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect that final results will be available in mid-2016.\nSHAPE's composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2028. We have acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to SHAPE for all indications.\nBirinapant is a novel small molecule therapeutic that mimics Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases, or SMAC-mimetic, which leads to apoptosis, or cell-death, in damaged cells. In June 2014, we commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of birinapant administered with azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated, higher risk MDS. On January 6, 2016, we announced interim results from this study in which birinapant did not demonstrate any clinical benefit over placebo on the primary endpoint of response rate after four months of therapy and met the bounds for futility. This interim analysis included the first 62 patients randomized in the trial. As a result, the MDS clinical trial was terminated as of January 6, 2016.\nWe have generated pre-clinical data indicating that birinapant induces apoptosis in-vivo in mouse hepatocytes infected with HBV. In a mouse model, we have seen clearance of HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, and the appearance of antibodies directed against HBsAg, a clinical finding considered equivalent to a functional cure. We have also seen activity of birinapant in other infectious disease models, including human mononuclear cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in-vitro, and in-vivo in mouse models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila.\nIn May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic HBV multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in Australia due to cranial nerve palsies observed in the first cohort. In July 2015, we announced that we intend to initiate a combination single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose clinical trial, with birinapant as a single agent, in chronic HBV subjects. These subjects will not be taking any antiviral medication. In the single ascending dose phase of the trial, subjects will be given a single dose of birinapant. The dose of birinapant will be escalated until at least one of the subjects shows evidence of activity, defined as a transient increase in liver transaminases and/or a decline in circulating viral DNA. At that point the cohort will be expanded and additional subjects will each receive four weekly administrations, at that dose, of birinapant. The starting dose of birinapant will be 2.8 mg/m2. We have retained a clinical research organization to initiate this trial at multiple sites. The application to commence the clinical trial is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. However, there is no assurance that approval will be forthcoming. Timing of results will depend upon receiving approval to proceed, enrollment rates and the cohort in which activity, if any, is seen.\nWe discovered birinapant, and its composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2030. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights for all indications.\nWe are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, have not generated any product sales revenues and have not achieved profitable operations. Our accumulated deficit through December 31, 2015 was $175.6 million, and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods.\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $20.3 million and $27.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our clinical-stage product candidates, birinapant and SHAPE. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which have been converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued convertible notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In 2015 we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) for net proceeds of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we had $53.7 million and $20.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our research, development and licensing efforts and, ultimately, upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of birinapant and SHAPE. Our short- and long-term capital requirements depend upon a variety of factors, including our clinical development plan and various other factors discussed below.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninitiation, progress, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nclinical development plans we establish for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense receipt payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nnumber and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\noutcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing or defending other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\neffect of competing technological and market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether we are able to maintain our listing under Nasdaq.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, and our financial condition as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to derivative liabilities, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nIn January 2015, we granted stock options for 600,000 shares of our Common Stock and 450,000 shares of restricted stock to certain of our executive officers that include both a service condition and a market condition. For the stock options, we calculated the fair value of these options using fair value models that consider both the market condition and service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the accelerated attribution method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time. For the restricted stock, we calculated the fair value of the awards using fair value models that consider both the market condition and the service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time.\nFor all other stock options issued to employees and members of our board of directors for their services on our board of directors, we estimate the grant date fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates, the value of the common stock and expected dividend yields of the common stock. For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based payments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values, and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC Topic 505, Equity.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized by award type is as follows:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOption awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,299,870 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,933,916 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestricted stock awards\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84,930 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n746,437 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,384,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,680,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal compensation cost recognized for all stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations is as follows:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n933,814 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,569,886 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,450,986 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,110,467 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,384,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,680,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Trial Expense Accruals\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our\nclinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nContingent Consideration\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger 100% of Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. The acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within ASC 805, Business Combinations. It is currently estimated that the Shape Pharmaceuticals milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted milestones we could be required to pay under our agreement is between zero and $64.5 million. We determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future milestone payments was based on several factors including:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates in the U.S. and Rest of World, or ROW;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe probability of success for product candidates including risks associated with uncertainty, achievement and payment of milestone events;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and ROW;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe risk adjusted discount rate for fair value measurement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe credit risk of TetraLogic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contingent consideration payments have been recorded as a liability and the fair value is evaluated quarterly or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. The decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during 2015 was due primarily to the increase in the credit risk of TetraLogic during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Make-whole Derivative\nOur 8% Notes include an interest make-whole feature whereby if a noteholder converts any of the Notes after December 31, 2014, they are entitled, in addition to the other consideration payable or deliverable in connection with such conversion, to an interest make-whole payment through the earlier of (i) the date that is three years after the conversion date and (ii) the maturity date if the notes had not been so converted. We have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative and have recognized the fair value of this derivative as a liability on our balance sheet, with subsequent changes to fair value recorded through earnings at each reporting period on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The fair value of this embedded derivative was\ndetermined based on a binomial lattice model. During 2015, the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in our stock price\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets were $41.6 million at December 31, 2015 and were recorded at fair value as part of the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Shape\u201d) in April 2014. We will transfer the carrying value of the assets to intangible assets and amortize them over their estimated useful life when the development of the assets is complete. Until that time, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter on an annual basis, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When performing the review for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to recalculate the fair value of the assets. If we determine, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying amount, then we calculate the asset's fair value based on the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset. If the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written down to its fair value. Through December 31, 2015, no impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred.\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired. We recorded $16.9 million in goodwill related to our acquisition of Shape in April 2014. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. We perform an annual test of impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We utilize a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then we would perform the second step of the impairment test and allocate the fair value to all assets and liabilities using the authoritative guidance for business combinations, with any residual fair value amount assigned to goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized if the implied fair value of our goodwill is less than its carrying value. We performed this two-step process as of December 31, 2015 and determined that a goodwill impairment existed, due primarily to the significant decrease in the fair value of our single reporting unit. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $16.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales since we commenced operations. In the future, if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator or licensee to commercialize our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services. General and Administrative Expenses are expensed when incurred.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $10.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.7 million, offset by decreases in compensation costs, legal expenses, and minor decreases in travel, recruiting, and investor relations expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfacilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with pre-clinical activities and regulatory operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we incurred approximately $20.3 million, and $27.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increased stock compensation expense, increased manufacturing and formulation activities related to SHAPE and increased expenses relating to our MDS, ovarian, HBV and SHAPE clinical trials, offset by lower expenses related to birinapant manufacturing and formulation activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis as the majority of our past and planned expenses have been and will be in support of birinapant. However, we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClinical development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,969,010 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,628,977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManufacturing and formulation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,100,528 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,749,743 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel related\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,424,838 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,518,958 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n933,814 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,569,886 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsulting\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n496,929 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n485,111 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther research and non-clinical development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,361,707 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,448,994 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,286,826 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,401,669 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by targeted indication for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBlood cancers (MDS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,188,957 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,266,055 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSolid tumors\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,858,584 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2,450,948 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInfectious diseases (HBV)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n578,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,325,137 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShape (CTCL)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2,158,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,269,472 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther pre-clinical and non-indication specific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,502,334 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,090,057 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,286,826 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,401,669 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will need to secure additional funding in the future in order to carry out all of our planned research and development activities with respect to our product candidates. We will incur substantial costs beyond our present and planned clinical trials in order to file NDAs in target indications for both birinapant and SHAPE, and in each case, the nature, design, size and cost of further studies and trials will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and trials and discussions with regulators.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the costs and duration of our current or future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation.\nIn addition, the probability of success for our product candidates will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nMarket acceptance of our product candidates, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nefficacy and safety of our product candidates administered alone or with other drugs, and post-marketing experience of the drugs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nclinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer or infectious disease clinics and patients of our product candidates as safe and effective treatments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npotential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nproduct labeling or package insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ntiming of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\neffectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of our product candidates, as well as an assessment of their commercial potential.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nThe acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalties. We recorded the liability for the contingent consideration based on its fair value on the date of the acquisition, and we record any change in fair value of the contingent consideration in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of contingent consideration included in loss from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2.6 million, and $ (10.4) million, respectively. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due primarily to accretion related to the passage of time. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to a significant increase in the credit risk of the Company during the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as due to the to the effect of changes in assumptions for timing of payments, amount of future royalties, and probability of success based on current facts and circumstances, as well as due to the passage of time.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nCertain of our warrants to purchase our common stock are classified as derivative liabilities and recorded at fair value. These derivative liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $0.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of these derivative liabilities is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock in 2014 and 2015.\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our 8% Notes due 2019 issued in June 2014 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of this derivative liability of $0.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our 8% Notes to December 31, 2014, and the continued decrease during 2015.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $3.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, is attributable to coupon interest on our 8% Notes and to non-cash interest expense resulting from the accretion of the debt discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with our 8% Notes issued in June 2014.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to $34.9 million as compared to $32.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven primarily by increased costs for research and development and by the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets during 2015 as compared to the increase during 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2015 is attributable primarily to the excess of maturities over purchases of investments during the period. Cash used in investing activities in 2014 is due primarily to the purchase of Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014 for $12.8 million, net of cash received, and to the purchase of short-term investments in corporate bonds and commercial paper with the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $44.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 is attributable primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014. In 2015, cash provided from financing activities is mostly attributable to the sale of Common Stock to LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million, offset by payments made to retire convertible notes during the period.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under Section 107 of the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $36.0 million and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our operating activities used $32.4 million and $34.9 million of cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $175.6 million, working capital of $18.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $20.4 million. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which were converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued our 8% Notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses, as further described below. In 2015, we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million.\nOn June 23, 2014, we issued through a private placement $47.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Notes, of which $43.75 million remain outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Interest on our 8% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced December 15, 2014. Our 8% Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, rank equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and rank structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. We may not redeem our 8% Notes at our option prior to maturity. Our 8% Notes are convertible prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions described below, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 148.3019 shares per $1,000 principal amount of our 8% Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.74 per share of common stock). This conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. We may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The indenture for our 8% Notes contains certain covenants which limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain additional indebtedness except for certain\npermitted debt, and to incur liens except for certain permitted liens. We will also be restricted from taking certain actions that could result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of our 8% Notes until we receive stockholder approval. We are in compliance with all the covenants set forth in the indenture governing our 8% Notes.\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13.0 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We currently estimate that the milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted amounts that we could be required to pay under our agreement for the milestone payments is between zero and $64.5 million.\nSimilar to other clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, our access to traditional bank credit is limited. Although we have had a revolving line of credit in the past, we do not currently have an open revolving line of credit or access to bank finance. We have limited assets which can be used as collateral to secure potential indebtedness. Moreover, as noted above, we have not received any material revenues since inception. Therefore, our ability to fund our operations and sustain our clinical development programs is dependent on our ability to raise additional funding, including through issuances of debt or equity securities. None of our current investors is required to invest any additional capital in us. Thus, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient capital in the future from these or other similar sources or the public markets to fund our operations, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, the need to raise capital is expected to consume management resources, time and attention and, to a lesser extent, the time and attention of our scientific staff.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we fund our planned clinical trials for our product candidates. Following our initial public offering, we are now a publicly traded company and have incurred significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were inapplicable to us as a private company. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash\nand investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe results of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates, and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of commercialization activities if birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of manufacturing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and, if approved, in commercial sale;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nany product liability infringement or other lawsuits related to our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs associated with any future acquisitions or in-licensing of additional assets or companies to further expand our technology base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We may in-license or acquire additional assets or companies in the future to further expand our technology base. However, we may not have sufficient cash reserves or other liquid assets to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds to complete future transactions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n44,059,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty-Based and Other Commitments\nLicense Agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nIn October 2008, Shape Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. (the Licensors\u201d) to grant a license under its interest in certain patent rights as defined in the license agreement, which include claims covering the composition of the SHAPE molecule. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. The Licensors received 400,000 shares of common stock of Shape Pharmaceuticals in consideration for the grant of the license, for which they received a payment of $213,317 when we acquired Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014. We also paid the Licensors an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 in 2012 and will pay $50,000 on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement and on each subsequent anniversary date thereafter as long as the license agreement remains in full force and effect. The annual maintenance fee of $50,000 was paid in 2013, 2014 and 2015. As defined in the license agreement, we may be required to pay milestones on an indication-by-indication basis of up to $4,450,000 in the aggregate and/or royalties of net sales of developed products, if and when achieved. Annual maintenance fee payments can be used to offset milestone obligations. We paid a milestone payment of $100,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice.\nCTCL Trial with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\nIn June 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS, to fund the development of SHAPE. Under the LLS funding agreement, we are obligated to use the funding received exclusively for the payment or reimbursement of the costs and expenses for clinical development activities for SHAPE. Under this agreement, we retain ownership and control of all intellectual property pertaining to works of authorship, inventions, know-how, information, data and proprietary material.\nUnder the LLS funding agreement, as amended, we received funding of $2.695 million from LLS through 2014. We terminated the funding agreement effective as of February 2014. We are required to make specified payments to LLS, including payments payable upon execution of the first out-license; first filing of approval for marketing by a regulatory body; first approval for marketing by a regulatory body; and completion of the first commercial sale of SHAPE. The extent of these payments and our obligations will depend on whether we out-license rights to develop or commercialize SHAPE to a third party, we commercialize SHAPE on our own or we combine with or are sold to another company. In addition, we will pay to LLS a single-digit percentage royalty of our net sales of SHAPE, if any. The sum of our payments to LLS is capped at three times the total funding received from LLS, or $8.085 million.\nIn addition, some of our obligations under the funding agreement will remain in effect until the completion of specified milestones and payments to LLS. Assuming the successful outcome of the development activities covered by the LLS funding agreement and our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, we will be required to take commercially reasonable steps through 2019 to advance the development of SHAPE in clinical trials and to bring SHAPE to practical application for CTCL in a major market country, provided that we reasonably believe the product is safe and effective. We believe that we can satisfy our obligation by out-licensing SHAPE to, or partnering SHAPE with, a third party. We are required to report to LLS on our efforts and results with respect to continuing development of SHAPE. Our failure to perform these diligence obligations, even if we successfully achieve the specified development milestones, would require us to pay back to LLS the total amount of the funding we received from them, unless an exception applies. If LLS were\nto claim that such failure occurred and we disagreed with such claim, the dispute would be settled through binding arbitration. In connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, we estimated the fair value of this potential obligation to be $200,000, which is included within contingent consideration and other liabilities in our December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 balance sheet.\nBecause the achievement and timing of our net sales is dependent on successful completion of our clinical programs and is therefore not fixed and determinable, our commitments under these agreements have not been included on our balance sheets or in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table above.\nIn July 2015, we assigned our worldwide patents for birinapant and SHAPE to two wholly-owned subsidiaries domiciled in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d), in consideration for payments to be made over a 10 year period. Although the assignment of the intellectual property rights did not result in any gain or loss in our consolidated financial statements, the transaction did result in a taxable gain in the United States and we are utilizing available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset this taxable gain. The UK subsidiaries will be responsible for the future development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE, and will recognize the net profits or losses generated from those activities.\nLicense Agreement with Princeton University\nIn November 2003, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Princeton University, subsequently amended in June 2004, August 2006 and October 2006, which grants us the rights to certain U.S. patents controlled by the university relating to SMAC-mimetic compounds, including birinapant, and a non-exclusive right to certain know-how and technology relating thereto. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. To date, we have paid an aggregate of $100,000 in license fees under the license agreement. As part of the consideration paid, we issued to Princeton University 9,734 shares of our common stock and agreed to pay Princeton University certain royalties. In particular, we are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage of net product sales of 2.0% for direct licensed products, such as birinapant, and 0.5% of derived licensed products, if such products are covered by the applicable Princeton University patent rights. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to Princeton University by the amount of any royalties paid to a third-party in a pro rata manner, provided that the royalty rate may not be less than 1.0% of net sales for direct licensed products and 0.25% for derived licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties in the U.S. expires upon the expiration, lapse or abandonment of the last of the licensed patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of the direct licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties outside the U.S. expires, on a country by country basis, 10 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country. The licensed patent rights were developed using federal funds from the National Institutes of Health and are subject to certain overriding rights of and obligations to the federal government as provided in the Bayh-Dole Act. This agreement expires upon expiration of the last of the licensed patent rights in 2023 (absent extensions).\nThe agreement also requires that we pay to Princeton University 2.5% of the non-royalty consideration that we receive from a sublicensee. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop, test, obtain regulatory approval, manufacture, market and sell licensed products in all countries worldwide.\nLicense Agreement with Walter and Eliza Hall Institute\nIn January 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, or WEHI, in Melbourne, Australia for worldwide exclusive rights to a patent application and any patents issuing therefrom relating to a method of treating intracellular infections involving the administration of an IAP antagonist. WEHI will perform research and development services for which we will be making payments over the first 5 years of the agreement in the amount of $1.25 million, of which we have paid $1.0 million to date. We are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage of net sales of 2% for products that are based either on the licensed patents or any patents arising from research performed by WEHI. We are also obligated to pay royalties as a percentage of net income of 15% received from sublicensing the licensed patents or any patents arising from research performed by WEHI to a third party. We may also be required to make milestone payments to WEHI of up to $3,750,000 for the first indication and up to $1,875,000 for each of the next two indications based on the commencement of certain clinical trials and the filing and approval of new drug applications.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward- looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics in oncology, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates in development: birinapant and SHAPE. In May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, clinical trial, and in January 2016 we terminated the birinapant myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, clinical trial due to disappointing results in the trial. We have, however, applied to re-commence the HBV clinical trial in India and our application is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. We are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nIn January 2016, our board of directors authorized a reduction in our staff which we expect to complete in the first half of 2016. Our Chief Scientific Officer and our Chief Operating Officer are included in those reductions. Following the reduction, we will have only nine remaining employees. In connection with these reductions, we expect to incur a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $2.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2016, which may increase later in the year, depending on potential facility-related charges and other write-downs that have not yet been finalized.\nOn January 20, 2016, we were notified by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum market value listing requirements of the exchange and that we have until July 18, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. On February 23, 2016, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of the exchange and that we have until August 22, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. We are currently considering available options to regain compliance.\nOn January 28, 2016, we announced that we retained Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., as our financial advisor, to provide financial advisory, restructuring and investment banking services in connection with analyzing and considering a wide range of transactional and strategic alternatives. We are currently focusing on our clinical programs and exploring various alternatives, but can give no assurance that our clinical programs will yield any commercially viable product or that a transaction of any kind will occur.\nSHAPE is our proprietary histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor that we are developing for topical use for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, and we are exploring studying SHAPE in alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. SHAPE has been granted U.S. orphan drug designation for CTCL. CTCL is a form of non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma which primarily manifests in the skin. The majority of CTCL cases are indolent; however, there are rare cases of CTCL that are aggressive and life-threatening. HDAC is a validated cancer target, and HDAC inhibitors, or HDACi, are a proven class of anti-cancer drugs for CTCL. SHAPE is a novel therapeutic, designed to maximize HDAC inhibition locally in the skin with limited systemic exposure, and it has characteristics that could allow its topical use over large body surface areas with minimal systemic absorption. By potentially avoiding toxicities typical of systemically-administered HDACi's, SHAPE may provide a more favorable safety profile than current HDACi's delivered orally or intravenously. SHAPE has been evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in early-stage CTCL. SHAPE was well-tolerated, and it demonstrated evidence of clinical activity with partial responses, or PRs, observed in certain subjects after 28 days of application.\nOn January 6, 2016, we announced that we had undertaken an interim analysis of our randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE. The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of three different dosing regimens of SHAPE in patients suffering from earlier stage CTCL. All patients in the clinical trial had received prior therapy either in the form of topical steroids, UV light therapy, topical nitrogen mustard, or some other agent. Twenty-eight of 34 patients were evaluable for response at the six month time point. After six months of treatment, eight of 34 patients exhibited a response to treatment as assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity, or CAILS, the primary endpoint, and a further 18 had stable disease. Using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, or mSWAT, a secondary endpoint in the clinical trial, 11 of 34 patients responded and a further 14 patients had stable disease at the six month endpoint.\nThe interim results taken during this Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that SHAPE also showed improvement in pruritus (itch), a significant symptom associated with CTCL. Thirty-eight percent of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful decrease in pruritus during the clinical trial as measured by a Visual Analog Scale. SHAPE was well tolerated by patients in the clinical trial. The 60 patient clinical trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect that final results will be available in mid-2016.\nSHAPE's composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2028. We have acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to SHAPE for all indications.\nBirinapant is a novel small molecule therapeutic that mimics Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases, or SMAC-mimetic, which leads to apoptosis, or cell-death, in damaged cells. In June 2014, we commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of birinapant administered with azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated, higher risk MDS. On January 6, 2016, we announced interim results from this study in which birinapant did not demonstrate any clinical benefit over placebo on the primary endpoint of response rate after four months of therapy and met the bounds for futility. This interim analysis included the first 62 patients randomized in the trial. As a result, the MDS clinical trial was terminated as of January 6, 2016.\nWe have generated pre-clinical data indicating that birinapant induces apoptosis in-vivo in mouse hepatocytes infected with HBV. In a mouse model, we have seen clearance of HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, and the appearance of antibodies directed against HBsAg, a clinical finding considered equivalent to a functional cure. We have also seen activity of birinapant in other infectious disease models, including human mononuclear cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in-vitro, and in-vivo in mouse models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila.\nIn May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic HBV multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in Australia due to cranial nerve palsies observed in the first cohort. In July 2015, we announced that we intend to initiate a combination single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose clinical trial, with birinapant as a single agent, in chronic HBV subjects. These subjects will not be taking any antiviral medication. In the single ascending dose phase of the trial, subjects will be given a single dose of birinapant. The dose of birinapant will be escalated until at least one of the subjects shows evidence of activity, defined as a transient increase in liver transaminases and/or a decline in circulating viral DNA. At that point the cohort will be expanded and additional subjects will each receive four weekly administrations, at that dose, of birinapant. The starting dose of birinapant will be 2.8 mg/m2. We have retained a clinical research organization to initiate this trial at multiple sites. The application to commence the clinical trial is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. However, there is no assurance that approval will be forthcoming. Timing of results will depend upon receiving approval to proceed, enrollment rates and the cohort in which activity, if any, is seen.\nWe discovered birinapant, and its composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2030. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights for all indications.\nWe are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, have not generated any product sales revenues and have not achieved profitable operations. Our accumulated deficit through December 31, 2015 was $175.6 million, and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods.\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $20.3 million and $27.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our clinical-stage product candidates, birinapant and SHAPE. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which have been converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued convertible notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In 2015 we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) for net proceeds of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we had $53.7 million and $20.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our research, development and licensing efforts and, ultimately, upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of birinapant and SHAPE. Our short- and long-term capital requirements depend upon a variety of factors, including our clinical development plan and various other factors discussed below.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\n \u00b7 initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 clinical development plans we establish for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 our obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense receipt payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements; \n \u00b7 number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop; \n \u00b7 outcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect; \n \u00b7 costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing or defending other intellectual property rights; \n \u00b7 effect of competing technological and market developments; \n \u00b7 costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities; \n \u00b7 costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and \n \u00b7 whether we are able to maintain our listing under Nasdaq. \nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, and our financial condition as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to derivative liabilities, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nIn January 2015, we granted stock options for 600,000 shares of our Common Stock and 450,000 shares of restricted stock to certain of our executive officers that include both a service condition and a market condition. For the stock options, we calculated the fair value of these options using fair value models that consider both the market condition and service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the accelerated attribution method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time. For the restricted stock, we calculated the fair value of the awards using fair value models that consider both the market condition and the service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time.\nFor all other stock options issued to employees and members of our board of directors for their services on our board of directors, we estimate the grant date fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates, the value of the common stock and expected dividend yields of the common stock. For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based payments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values, and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC Topic 505, Equity.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized by award type is as follows:\n\nTotal compensation cost recognized for all stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations is as follows:\n\nClinical Trial Expense Accruals\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our\nclinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nContingent Consideration\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger 100% of Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. The acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within ASC 805, Business Combinations. It is currently estimated that the Shape Pharmaceuticals milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted milestones we could be required to pay under our agreement is between zero and $64.5 million. We determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future milestone payments was based on several factors including:\n \u00b7 estimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates in the U.S. and Rest of World, or ROW; \n \u00b7 the probability of success for product candidates including risks associated with uncertainty, achievement and payment of milestone events; \n \u00b7 the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; \n \u00b7 the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and ROW; \n \u00b7 the risk adjusted discount rate for fair value measurement; and \n \u00b7 the credit risk of TetraLogic. \nThe contingent consideration payments have been recorded as a liability and the fair value is evaluated quarterly or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. The decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during 2015 was due primarily to the increase in the credit risk of TetraLogic during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Make-whole Derivative\nOur 8% Notes include an interest make-whole feature whereby if a noteholder converts any of the Notes after December 31, 2014, they are entitled, in addition to the other consideration payable or deliverable in connection with such conversion, to an interest make-whole payment through the earlier of (i) the date that is three years after the conversion date and (ii) the maturity date if the notes had not been so converted. We have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative and have recognized the fair value of this derivative as a liability on our balance sheet, with subsequent changes to fair value recorded through earnings at each reporting period on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The fair value of this embedded derivative was\ndetermined based on a binomial lattice model. During 2015, the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in our stock price\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets were $41.6 million at December 31, 2015 and were recorded at fair value as part of the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Shape\u201d) in April 2014. We will transfer the carrying value of the assets to intangible assets and amortize them over their estimated useful life when the development of the assets is complete. Until that time, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter on an annual basis, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When performing the review for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to recalculate the fair value of the assets. If we determine, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying amount, then we calculate the asset's fair value based on the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset. If the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written down to its fair value. Through December 31, 2015, no impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred.\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired. We recorded $16.9 million in goodwill related to our acquisition of Shape in April 2014. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. We perform an annual test of impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We utilize a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then we would perform the second step of the impairment test and allocate the fair value to all assets and liabilities using the authoritative guidance for business combinations, with any residual fair value amount assigned to goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized if the implied fair value of our goodwill is less than its carrying value. We performed this two-step process as of December 31, 2015 and determined that a goodwill impairment existed, due primarily to the significant decrease in the fair value of our single reporting unit. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $16.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales since we commenced operations. In the future, if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator or licensee to commercialize our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services. General and Administrative Expenses are expensed when incurred.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $10.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.7 million, offset by decreases in compensation costs, legal expenses, and minor decreases in travel, recruiting, and investor relations expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and \n \u00b7 costs associated with pre-clinical activities and regulatory operations. \nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we incurred approximately $20.3 million, and $27.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increased stock compensation expense, increased manufacturing and formulation activities related to SHAPE and increased expenses relating to our MDS, ovarian, HBV and SHAPE clinical trials, offset by lower expenses related to birinapant manufacturing and formulation activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis as the majority of our past and planned expenses have been and will be in support of birinapant. However, we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by targeted indication for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\n\nWe will need to secure additional funding in the future in order to carry out all of our planned research and development activities with respect to our product candidates. We will incur substantial costs beyond our present and planned clinical trials in order to file NDAs in target indications for both birinapant and SHAPE, and in each case, the nature, design, size and cost of further studies and trials will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and trials and discussions with regulators.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the costs and duration of our current or future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation.\nIn addition, the probability of success for our product candidates will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nMarket acceptance of our product candidates, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n \u00b7 efficacy and safety of our product candidates administered alone or with other drugs, and post-marketing experience of the drugs; \n \u00b7 clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved; \n \u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer or infectious disease clinics and patients of our product candidates as safe and effective treatments; \n \u00b7 potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments; \n \u00b7 prevalence and severity of any side effects; \n \u00b7 product labeling or package insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products; \n \u00b7 cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments; \n \u00b7 availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; \n \u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration; and \n \u00b7 effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. \nWe will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of our product candidates, as well as an assessment of their commercial potential.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nThe acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalties. We recorded the liability for the contingent consideration based on its fair value on the date of the acquisition, and we record any change in fair value of the contingent consideration in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of contingent consideration included in loss from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2.6 million, and $ (10.4) million, respectively. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due primarily to accretion related to the passage of time. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to a significant increase in the credit risk of the Company during the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as due to the to the effect of changes in assumptions for timing of payments, amount of future royalties, and probability of success based on current facts and circumstances, as well as due to the passage of time.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nCertain of our warrants to purchase our common stock are classified as derivative liabilities and recorded at fair value. These derivative liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $0.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of these derivative liabilities is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock in 2014 and 2015.\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our 8% Notes due 2019 issued in June 2014 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of this derivative liability of $0.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our 8% Notes to December 31, 2014, and the continued decrease during 2015.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $3.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, is attributable to coupon interest on our 8% Notes and to non-cash interest expense resulting from the accretion of the debt discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with our 8% Notes issued in June 2014.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to $34.9 million as compared to $32.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven primarily by increased costs for research and development and by the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets during 2015 as compared to the increase during 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2015 is attributable primarily to the excess of maturities over purchases of investments during the period. Cash used in investing activities in 2014 is due primarily to the purchase of Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014 for $12.8 million, net of cash received, and to the purchase of short-term investments in corporate bonds and commercial paper with the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $44.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 is attributable primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014. In 2015, cash provided from financing activities is mostly attributable to the sale of Common Stock to LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million, offset by payments made to retire convertible notes during the period.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under Section 107 of the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $36.0 million and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our operating activities used $32.4 million and $34.9 million of cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $175.6 million, working capital of $18.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $20.4 million. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which were converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued our 8% Notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses, as further described below. In 2015, we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million.\nOn June 23, 2014, we issued through a private placement $47.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Notes, of which $43.75 million remain outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Interest on our 8% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced December 15, 2014. Our 8% Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, rank equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and rank structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. We may not redeem our 8% Notes at our option prior to maturity. Our 8% Notes are convertible prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions described below, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 148.3019 shares per $1,000 principal amount of our 8% Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.74 per share of common stock). This conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. We may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The indenture for our 8% Notes contains certain covenants which limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain additional indebtedness except for certain\npermitted debt, and to incur liens except for certain permitted liens. We will also be restricted from taking certain actions that could result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of our 8% Notes until we receive stockholder approval. We are in compliance with all the covenants set forth in the indenture governing our 8% Notes.\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13.0 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We currently estimate that the milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted amounts that we could be required to pay under our agreement for the milestone payments is between zero and $64.5 million.\nSimilar to other clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, our access to traditional bank credit is limited. Although we have had a revolving line of credit in the past, we do not currently have an open revolving line of credit or access to bank finance. We have limited assets which can be used as collateral to secure potential indebtedness. Moreover, as noted above, we have not received any material revenues since inception. Therefore, our ability to fund our operations and sustain our clinical development programs is dependent on our ability to raise additional funding, including through issuances of debt or equity securities. None of our current investors is required to invest any additional capital in us. Thus, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient capital in the future from these or other similar sources or the public markets to fund our operations, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, the need to raise capital is expected to consume management resources, time and attention and, to a lesser extent, the time and attention of our scientific staff.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we fund our planned clinical trials for our product candidates. Following our initial public offering, we are now a publicly traded company and have incurred significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were inapplicable to us as a private company. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash\nand investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the results of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates, and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities if birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; \n \u00b7 the cost of manufacturing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and, if approved, in commercial sale; \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u00b7 any product liability infringement or other lawsuits related to our products; \n \u00b7 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company; \n \u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \n \u00b7 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any; and \n \u00b7 the costs associated with any future acquisitions or in-licensing of additional assets or companies to further expand our technology base. \nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We may in-license or acquire additional assets or companies in the future to further expand our technology base. However, we may not have sufficient cash reserves or other liquid assets to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds to complete future transactions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\n\nRoyalty-Based and Other Commitments\nLicense Agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nIn October 2008, Shape Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. (the Licensors\u201d) to grant a license under its interest in certain patent rights as defined in the license agreement, which include claims covering the composition of the SHAPE molecule. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. The Licensors received 400,000 shares of common stock of Shape Pharmaceuticals in consideration for the grant of the license, for which they received a payment of $213,317 when we acquired Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014. We also paid the Licensors an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 in 2012 and will pay $50,000 on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement and on each subsequent anniversary date thereafter as long as the license agreement remains in full force and effect. The annual maintenance fee of $50,000 was paid in 2013, 2014 and 2015. As defined in the license agreement, we may be required to pay milestones on an indication-by-indication basis of up to $4,450,000 in the aggregate and/or royalties of net sales of developed products, if and when achieved. Annual maintenance fee payments can be used to offset milestone obligations. We paid a milestone payment of $100,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice.\nCTCL Trial with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\nIn June 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS, to fund the development of SHAPE. Under the LLS funding agreement, we are obligated to use the funding received exclusively for the payment or reimbursement of the costs and expenses for clinical development activities for SHAPE. Under this agreement, we retain ownership and control of all intellectual property pertaining to works of authorship, inventions, know-how, information, data and proprietary material.\nUnder the LLS funding agreement, as amended, we received funding of $2.695 million from LLS through 2014. We terminated the funding agreement effective as of February 2014. We are required to make specified payments to LLS, including payments payable upon execution of the first out-license; first filing of approval for marketing by a regulatory body; first approval for marketing by a regulatory body; and completion of the first commercial sale of SHAPE. The extent of these payments and our obligations will depend on whether we out-license rights to develop or commercialize SHAPE to a third party, we commercialize SHAPE on our own or we combine with or are sold to another company. In addition, we will pay to LLS a single-digit percentage royalty of our net sales of SHAPE, if any. The sum of our payments to LLS is capped at three times the total funding received from LLS, or $8.085 million.\nIn addition, some of our obligations under the funding agreement will remain in effect until the completion of specified milestones and payments to LLS. Assuming the successful outcome of the development activities covered by the LLS funding agreement and our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, we will be required to take commercially reasonable steps through 2019 to advance the development of SHAPE in clinical trials and to bring SHAPE to practical application for CTCL in a major market country, provided that we reasonably believe the product is safe and effective. We believe that we can satisfy our obligation by out-licensing SHAPE to, or partnering SHAPE with, a third party. We are required to report to LLS on our efforts and results with respect to continuing development of SHAPE. Our failure to perform these diligence obligations, even if we successfully achieve the specified development milestones, would require us to pay back to LLS the total amount of the funding we received from them, unless an exception applies. If LLS were\nto claim that such failure occurred and we disagreed with such claim, the dispute would be settled through binding arbitration. In connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, we estimated the fair value of this potential obligation to be $200,000, which is included within contingent consideration and other liabilities in our December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 balance sheet.\nBecause the achievement and timing of our net sales is dependent on successful completion of our clinical programs and is therefore not fixed and determinable, our commitments under these agreements have not been included on our balance sheets or in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table above.\nIn July 2015, we assigned our worldwide patents for birinapant and SHAPE to two wholly-owned subsidiaries domiciled in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d), in consideration for payments to be made over a 10 year period. Although the assignment of the intellectual property rights did not result in any gain or loss in our consolidated financial statements, the transaction did result in a taxable gain in the United States and we are utilizing available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset this taxable gain. The UK subsidiaries will be responsible for the future development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE, and will recognize the net profits or losses generated from those activities.\nLicense Agreement with Princeton University\nIn November 2003, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Princeton University, subsequently amended in June 2004, August 2006 and October 2006, which grants us the rights to certain U.S. patents controlled by the university relating to SMAC-mimetic compounds, including birinapant, and a non-exclusive right to certain know-how and technology relating thereto. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. To date, we have paid an aggregate of $100,000 in license fees under the license agreement. As part of the consideration paid, we issued to Princeton University 9,734 shares of our common stock and agreed to pay Princeton University certain royalties. In particular, we are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage of net product sales of 2.0% for direct licensed products, such as birinapant, and 0.5% of derived licensed products, if such products are covered by the applicable Princeton University patent rights. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to Princeton University by the amount of any royalties paid to a third-party in a pro rata manner, provided that the royalty rate may not be less than 1.0% of net sales for direct licensed products and 0.25% for derived licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties in the U.S. expires upon the expiration, lapse or abandonment of the last of the licensed patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of the direct licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties outside the U.S. expires, on a country by country basis, 10 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country. The licensed patent rights were developed using federal funds from the National Institutes of Health and are subject to certain overriding rights of and obligations to the federal government as provided in the Bayh-Dole Act. This agreement expires upon expiration of the last of the licensed patent rights in 2023 (absent extensions).\nThe agreement also requires that we pay to Princeton University 2.5% of the non-royalty consideration that we receive from a sublicensee. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop, test, obtain regulatory approval, manufacture, market and sell licensed products in all countries worldwide.\nLicense Agreement with Walter and Eliza Hall Institute\nIn January 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, or WEHI, in Melbourne, Australia for worldwide exclusive rights to a patent application and any patents issuing therefrom relating to a method of treating intracellular infections involving the administration of an IAP antagonist. WEHI will perform research and development services for which we will be making payments", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward- looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics in oncology, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates in development: birinapant and SHAPE. In May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, clinical trial, and in January 2016 we terminated the birinapant myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, clinical trial due to disappointing results in the trial. We have, however, applied to re-commence the HBV clinical trial in India and our application is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. We are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nIn January 2016, our board of directors authorized a reduction in our staff which we expect to complete in the first half of 2016. Our Chief Scientific Officer and our Chief Operating Officer are included in those reductions. Following the reduction, we will have only nine remaining employees. In connection with these reductions, we expect to incur a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $2.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2016, which may increase later in the year, depending on potential facility-related charges and other write-downs that have not yet been finalized.\nOn January 20, 2016, we were notified by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum market value listing requirements of the exchange and that we have until July 18, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. On February 23, 2016, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of the exchange and that we have until August 22, 2016 to regain compliance with this requirement or face delisting. We are currently considering available options to regain compliance.\nOn January 28, 2016, we announced that we retained Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., as our financial advisor, to provide financial advisory, restructuring and investment banking services in connection with analyzing and considering a wide range of transactional and strategic alternatives. We are currently focusing on our clinical programs and exploring various alternatives, but can give no assurance that our clinical programs will yield any commercially viable product or that a transaction of any kind will occur.\nSHAPE is our proprietary histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor that we are developing for topical use for the treatment of early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, and we are exploring studying SHAPE in alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. SHAPE has been granted U.S. orphan drug designation for CTCL. CTCL is a form of non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma which primarily manifests in the skin. The majority of CTCL cases are indolent; however, there are rare cases of CTCL that are aggressive and life-threatening. HDAC is a validated cancer target, and HDAC inhibitors, or HDACi, are a proven class of anti-cancer drugs for CTCL. SHAPE is a novel therapeutic, designed to maximize HDAC inhibition locally in the skin with limited systemic exposure, and it has characteristics that could allow its topical use over large body surface areas with minimal systemic absorption. By potentially avoiding toxicities typical of systemically-administered HDACi's, SHAPE may provide a more favorable safety profile than current HDACi's delivered orally or intravenously. SHAPE has been evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in early-stage CTCL. SHAPE was well-tolerated, and it demonstrated evidence of clinical activity with partial responses, or PRs, observed in certain subjects after 28 days of application.\nOn January 6, 2016, we announced that we had undertaken an interim analysis of our randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE. The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of three different dosing regimens of SHAPE in patients suffering from earlier stage CTCL. All patients in the clinical trial had received prior therapy either in the form of topical steroids, UV light therapy, topical nitrogen mustard, or some other agent. Twenty-eight of 34 patients were evaluable for response at the six month time point. After six months of treatment, eight of 34 patients exhibited a response to treatment as assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity, or CAILS, the primary endpoint, and a further 18 had stable disease. Using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, or mSWAT, a secondary endpoint in the clinical trial, 11 of 34 patients responded and a further 14 patients had stable disease at the six month endpoint.\nThe interim results taken during this Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that SHAPE also showed improvement in pruritus (itch), a significant symptom associated with CTCL. Thirty-eight percent of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful decrease in pruritus during the clinical trial as measured by a Visual Analog Scale. SHAPE was well tolerated by patients in the clinical trial. The 60 patient clinical trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect that final results will be available in mid-2016.\nSHAPE's composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2028. We have acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to SHAPE for all indications.\nBirinapant is a novel small molecule therapeutic that mimics Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases, or SMAC-mimetic, which leads to apoptosis, or cell-death, in damaged cells. In June 2014, we commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of birinapant administered with azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated, higher risk MDS. On January 6, 2016, we announced interim results from this study in which birinapant did not demonstrate any clinical benefit over placebo on the primary endpoint of response rate after four months of therapy and met the bounds for futility. This interim analysis included the first 62 patients randomized in the trial. As a result, the MDS clinical trial was terminated as of January 6, 2016.\nWe have generated pre-clinical data indicating that birinapant induces apoptosis in-vivo in mouse hepatocytes infected with HBV. In a mouse model, we have seen clearance of HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, and the appearance of antibodies directed against HBsAg, a clinical finding considered equivalent to a functional cure. We have also seen activity of birinapant in other infectious disease models, including human mononuclear cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in-vitro, and in-vivo in mouse models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila.\nIn May 2015, we temporarily halted the birinapant chronic HBV multiple ascending dose trial being conducted in Australia due to cranial nerve palsies observed in the first cohort. In July 2015, we announced that we intend to initiate a combination single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose clinical trial, with birinapant as a single agent, in chronic HBV subjects. These subjects will not be taking any antiviral medication. In the single ascending dose phase of the trial, subjects will be given a single dose of birinapant. The dose of birinapant will be escalated until at least one of the subjects shows evidence of activity, defined as a transient increase in liver transaminases and/or a decline in circulating viral DNA. At that point the cohort will be expanded and additional subjects will each receive four weekly administrations, at that dose, of birinapant. The starting dose of birinapant will be 2.8 mg/m2. We have retained a clinical research organization to initiate this trial at multiple sites. The application to commence the clinical trial is currently under review by the Indian regulatory authority. However, there is no assurance that approval will be forthcoming. Timing of results will depend upon receiving approval to proceed, enrollment rates and the cohort in which activity, if any, is seen.\nWe discovered birinapant, and its composition of matter patent in the U.S. extends until at least 2030. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights for all indications.\nWe are also exploring strategic alternatives with respect to birinapant, including the potential out-licensing of birinapant to interested partners.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, have not generated any product sales revenues and have not achieved profitable operations. Our accumulated deficit through December 31, 2015 was $175.6 million, and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods.\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $20.3 million and $27.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our clinical-stage product candidates, birinapant and SHAPE. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which have been converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued convertible notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In 2015 we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) for net proceeds of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we had $53.7 million and $20.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our research, development and licensing efforts and, ultimately, upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of birinapant and SHAPE. Our short- and long-term capital requirements depend upon a variety of factors, including our clinical development plan and various other factors discussed below.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\n \u00b7 initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 clinical development plans we establish for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 our obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense receipt payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements; \n \u00b7 number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop; \n \u00b7 outcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect; \n \u00b7 costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing or defending other intellectual property rights; \n \u00b7 effect of competing technological and market developments; \n \u00b7 costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities; \n \u00b7 costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for birinapant, SHAPE and any other future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and \n \u00b7 whether we are able to maintain our listing under Nasdaq. \nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, and our financial condition as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to derivative liabilities, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nIn January 2015, we granted stock options for 600,000 shares of our Common Stock and 450,000 shares of restricted stock to certain of our executive officers that include both a service condition and a market condition. For the stock options, we calculated the fair value of these options using fair value models that consider both the market condition and service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the accelerated attribution method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time. For the restricted stock, we calculated the fair value of the awards using fair value models that consider both the market condition and the service condition of the awards, and we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method. Should the market condition be reached during the vesting period, all remaining unamortized compensation expense will be recognized at that time.\nFor all other stock options issued to employees and members of our board of directors for their services on our board of directors, we estimate the grant date fair value of each option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates, the value of the common stock and expected dividend yields of the common stock. For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based payments issued to non-employees are recorded at their fair values, and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC Topic 505, Equity.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized by award type is as follows:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOption awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,299,870 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,933,916 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestricted stock awards\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84,930 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n746,437 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,384,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,680,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal compensation cost recognized for all stock-based compensation awards in the statements of operations is as follows:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n933,814 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,569,886 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,450,986 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,110,467 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,384,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,680,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Trial Expense Accruals\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our\nclinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.\nContingent Consideration\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger 100% of Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. The acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within ASC 805, Business Combinations. It is currently estimated that the Shape Pharmaceuticals milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted milestones we could be required to pay under our agreement is between zero and $64.5 million. We determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future milestone payments was based on several factors including:\n \u00b7 estimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates in the U.S. and Rest of World, or ROW; \n \u00b7 the probability of success for product candidates including risks associated with uncertainty, achievement and payment of milestone events; \n \u00b7 the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; \n \u00b7 the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and ROW; \n \u00b7 the risk adjusted discount rate for fair value measurement; and \n \u00b7 the credit risk of TetraLogic. \nThe contingent consideration payments have been recorded as a liability and the fair value is evaluated quarterly or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. The decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during 2015 was due primarily to the increase in the credit risk of TetraLogic during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Make-whole Derivative\nOur 8% Notes include an interest make-whole feature whereby if a noteholder converts any of the Notes after December 31, 2014, they are entitled, in addition to the other consideration payable or deliverable in connection with such conversion, to an interest make-whole payment through the earlier of (i) the date that is three years after the conversion date and (ii) the maturity date if the notes had not been so converted. We have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative and have recognized the fair value of this derivative as a liability on our balance sheet, with subsequent changes to fair value recorded through earnings at each reporting period on our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The fair value of this embedded derivative was\ndetermined based on a binomial lattice model. During 2015, the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in our stock price\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets were $41.6 million at December 31, 2015 and were recorded at fair value as part of the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Shape\u201d) in April 2014. We will transfer the carrying value of the assets to intangible assets and amortize them over their estimated useful life when the development of the assets is complete. Until that time, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter on an annual basis, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When performing the review for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to recalculate the fair value of the assets. If we determine, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying amount, then we calculate the asset's fair value based on the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset. If the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written down to its fair value. Through December 31, 2015, no impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred.\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired. We recorded $16.9 million in goodwill related to our acquisition of Shape in April 2014. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. We perform an annual test of impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We utilize a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then we would perform the second step of the impairment test and allocate the fair value to all assets and liabilities using the authoritative guidance for business combinations, with any residual fair value amount assigned to goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized if the implied fair value of our goodwill is less than its carrying value. We performed this two-step process as of December 31, 2015 and determined that a goodwill impairment existed, due primarily to the significant decrease in the fair value of our single reporting unit. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $16.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales since we commenced operations. In the future, if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we may generate revenue from product sales, or alternatively, we may choose to select a collaborator or licensee to commercialize our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services. General and Administrative Expenses are expensed when incurred.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $10.9 million, and $11.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.7 million, offset by decreases in compensation costs, legal expenses, and minor decreases in travel, recruiting, and investor relations expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies; and \n \u00b7 costs associated with pre-clinical activities and regulatory operations. \nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we incurred approximately $20.3 million, and $27.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increased stock compensation expense, increased manufacturing and formulation activities related to SHAPE and increased expenses relating to our MDS, ovarian, HBV and SHAPE clinical trials, offset by lower expenses related to birinapant manufacturing and formulation activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis as the majority of our past and planned expenses have been and will be in support of birinapant. However, we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClinical development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,969,010 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,628,977 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManufacturing and formulation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,100,528 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3,749,743 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel related\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,424,838 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,518,958 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n933,814 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,569,886 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsulting\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n496,929 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n485,111 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther research and non-clinical development\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,361,707 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,448,994 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,286,826 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,401,669 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by targeted indication for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBlood cancers (MDS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,188,957 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,266,055 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSolid tumors\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,858,584 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2,450,948 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInfectious diseases (HBV)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n578,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1,325,137 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShape (CTCL)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2,158,114 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5,269,472 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther pre-clinical and non-indication specific\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,502,334 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,090,057 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,286,826 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,401,669 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will need to secure additional funding in the future in order to carry out all of our planned research and development activities with respect to our product candidates. We will incur substantial costs beyond our present and planned clinical trials in order to file NDAs in target indications for both birinapant and SHAPE, and in each case, the nature, design, size and cost of further studies and trials will depend in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and trials and discussions with regulators.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the costs and duration of our current or future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation.\nIn addition, the probability of success for our product candidates will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nMarket acceptance of our product candidates, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n \u00b7 efficacy and safety of our product candidates administered alone or with other drugs, and post-marketing experience of the drugs; \n \u00b7 clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved; \n \u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer or infectious disease clinics and patients of our product candidates as safe and effective treatments; \n \u00b7 potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments; \n \u00b7 prevalence and severity of any side effects; \n \u00b7 product labeling or package insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products; \n \u00b7 cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments; \n \u00b7 availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; \n \u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration; and \n \u00b7 effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. \nWe will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of our product candidates, as well as an assessment of their commercial potential.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nThe acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals includes a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration in the form of milestone payments and tiered royalties. We recorded the liability for the contingent consideration based on its fair value on the date of the acquisition, and we record any change in fair value of the contingent consideration in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of contingent consideration included in loss from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2.6 million, and $ (10.4) million, respectively. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due primarily to accretion related to the passage of time. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to a significant increase in the credit risk of the Company during the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as due to the to the effect of changes in assumptions for timing of payments, amount of future royalties, and probability of success based on current facts and circumstances, as well as due to the passage of time.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nCertain of our warrants to purchase our common stock are classified as derivative liabilities and recorded at fair value. These derivative liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $0.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of these derivative liabilities is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock in 2014 and 2015.\nWe have classified the interest make-whole provision of our 8% Notes due 2019 issued in June 2014 as a derivative liability that is recorded at fair value. This derivative liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, we recorded a change in fair value of this derivative liability of $0.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of this derivative liability is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock from the date of issuance of our 8% Notes to December 31, 2014, and the continued decrease during 2015.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income consists principally of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $3.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, is attributable to coupon interest on our 8% Notes and to non-cash interest expense resulting from the accretion of the debt discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with our 8% Notes issued in June 2014.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to $34.9 million as compared to $32.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven primarily by increased costs for research and development and by the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets during 2015 as compared to the increase during 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2015 is attributable primarily to the excess of maturities over purchases of investments during the period. Cash used in investing activities in 2014 is due primarily to the purchase of Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014 for $12.8 million, net of cash received, and to the purchase of short-term investments in corporate bonds and commercial paper with the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $44.3 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 is attributable primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of our 8% Notes in June 2014. In 2015, cash provided from financing activities is mostly attributable to the sale of Common Stock to LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million, offset by payments made to retire convertible notes during the period.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under Section 107 of the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $36.0 million and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our operating activities used $32.4 million and $34.9 million of cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $175.6 million, working capital of $18.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $20.4 million. We funded our operations as a private company primarily through the sale of preferred stock and the issuance of convertible notes for gross proceeds totaling $85.4 million, which were converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We also received amounts under collaboration and grant arrangements totaling $13.7 million. In addition, in December 2013 we sold 8,222,115 shares of common stock in our initial public offering for net proceeds of $49.1 million after payment of underwriting fees and other expenses, and in June 2014 we issued our 8% Notes for proceeds of $44.1 million, net of underwriting fees and other expenses, as further described below. In 2015, we sold 1,435,612 shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with LPC for net proceeds of $2.6 million.\nOn June 23, 2014, we issued through a private placement $47.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Notes, of which $43.75 million remain outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Interest on our 8% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced December 15, 2014. Our 8% Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, rank equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities that are not so subordinated, are effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and rank structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. We may not redeem our 8% Notes at our option prior to maturity. Our 8% Notes are convertible prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions described below, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 148.3019 shares per $1,000 principal amount of our 8% Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.74 per share of common stock). This conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. We may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The indenture for our 8% Notes contains certain covenants which limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain additional indebtedness except for certain\npermitted debt, and to incur liens except for certain permitted liens. We will also be restricted from taking certain actions that could result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of our 8% Notes until we receive stockholder approval. We are in compliance with all the covenants set forth in the indenture governing our 8% Notes.\nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13.0 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We currently estimate that the milestone payments will occur between 2017 and 2021. The range of undiscounted amounts that we could be required to pay under our agreement for the milestone payments is between zero and $64.5 million.\nSimilar to other clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, our access to traditional bank credit is limited. Although we have had a revolving line of credit in the past, we do not currently have an open revolving line of credit or access to bank finance. We have limited assets which can be used as collateral to secure potential indebtedness. Moreover, as noted above, we have not received any material revenues since inception. Therefore, our ability to fund our operations and sustain our clinical development programs is dependent on our ability to raise additional funding, including through issuances of debt or equity securities. None of our current investors is required to invest any additional capital in us. Thus, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient capital in the future from these or other similar sources or the public markets to fund our operations, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, the need to raise capital is expected to consume management resources, time and attention and, to a lesser extent, the time and attention of our scientific staff.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we fund our planned clinical trials for our product candidates. Following our initial public offering, we are now a publicly traded company and have incurred significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were inapplicable to us as a private company. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe received written notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq\u201d) on January 20, 2016 and February 23, 2016 notifying us that we did not meet certain minimum listing requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Specifically, we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 for our common stock, the minimum publicly held market value requirement of $15 million for our outstanding common stock, or the minimum total market value requirement of $50 million for our outstanding common stock. If we are not able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules within the specified time period (generally 180 days from the date of notice), we would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. This event would be considered a fundamental change under the indenture for our 8% Notes, and we could be required by the noteholders to purchase for cash all of the outstanding 8% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 8% Notes ($43.75 million of which are outstanding as of December 31, 2015) plus accrued and unpaid interest. To regain compliance, the minimum total market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $50 million for 10 consecutive business days by July 18, 2016, the minimum bid price of our common stock would need to reach at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016, and the minimum publicly held market value of our common stock would need to reach at least $15 million for 10 consecutive business days by August 22, 2016. All of these events are outside of our control at this time. Should the delisting of our common stock occur during the second half of 2016, we do not currently have sufficient funds on hand to satisfy the obligations for the 8% Notes. Although we are currently considering available options to resolve our compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have no assurance that this will occur within the necessary time period to prevent delisting. In addition, we have no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations with respect to the 8% Notes in the event that delisting occurs. Should we remain in compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we believe our existing cash\nand investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016. In order for our existing cash and investments to fund operating and investing activities through December 31, 2016, we have limited our planned business activities to the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SHAPE and the winding down of the Phase 2 clinical trial in birinapant in MDS, and we announced a reduction in force in January 2016, which will reduce our headcount to 9 employees by April 2016.\nOur failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the results of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates, and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates; \n \u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities if birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; \n \u00b7 the cost of manufacturing birinapant, SHAPE or any other future product candidates in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and, if approved, in commercial sale; \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u00b7 any product liability infringement or other lawsuits related to our products; \n \u00b7 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company; \n \u00b7 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \n \u00b7 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any; and \n \u00b7 the costs associated with any future acquisitions or in-licensing of additional assets or companies to further expand our technology base. \nIn April 2014, we acquired by merger Shape Pharmaceuticals, a development stage pharmaceutical company developing SHAPE. We acquired this company to add a second clinical-stage oncology compound to the TetraLogic portfolio. We paid $13 million in cash at closing and entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration, including milestone payments and tiered royalty payments upon commercialization. We may in-license or acquire additional assets or companies in the future to further expand our technology base. However, we may not have sufficient cash reserves or other liquid assets to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds to complete future transactions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConvertible notes\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n44,059,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,348 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,750,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty-Based and Other Commitments\nLicense Agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nIn October 2008, Shape Pharmaceuticals entered into a license agreement with Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. (the Licensors\u201d) to grant a license under its interest in certain patent rights as defined in the license agreement, which include claims covering the composition of the SHAPE molecule. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. The Licensors received 400,000 shares of common stock of Shape Pharmaceuticals in consideration for the grant of the license, for which they received a payment of $213,317 when we acquired Shape Pharmaceuticals in April 2014. We also paid the Licensors an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 in 2012 and will pay $50,000 on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement and on each subsequent anniversary date thereafter as long as the license agreement remains in full force and effect. The annual maintenance fee of $50,000 was paid in 2013, 2014 and 2015. As defined in the license agreement, we may be required to pay milestones on an indication-by-indication basis of up to $4,450,000 in the aggregate and/or royalties of net sales of developed products, if and when achieved. Annual maintenance fee payments can be used to offset milestone obligations. We paid a milestone payment of $100,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice.\nCTCL Trial with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\nIn June 2010, we entered into a funding agreement with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS, to fund the development of SHAPE. Under the LLS funding agreement, we are obligated to use the funding received exclusively for the payment or reimbursement of the costs and expenses for clinical development activities for SHAPE. Under this agreement, we retain ownership and control of all intellectual property pertaining to works of authorship, inventions, know-how, information, data and proprietary material.\nUnder the LLS funding agreement, as amended, we received funding of $2.695 million from LLS through 2014. We terminated the funding agreement effective as of February 2014. We are required to make specified payments to LLS, including payments payable upon execution of the first out-license; first filing of approval for marketing by a regulatory body; first approval for marketing by a regulatory body; and completion of the first commercial sale of SHAPE. The extent of these payments and our obligations will depend on whether we out-license rights to develop or commercialize SHAPE to a third party, we commercialize SHAPE on our own or we combine with or are sold to another company. In addition, we will pay to LLS a single-digit percentage royalty of our net sales of SHAPE, if any. The sum of our payments to LLS is capped at three times the total funding received from LLS, or $8.085 million.\nIn addition, some of our obligations under the funding agreement will remain in effect until the completion of specified milestones and payments to LLS. Assuming the successful outcome of the development activities covered by the LLS funding agreement and our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, we will be required to take commercially reasonable steps through 2019 to advance the development of SHAPE in clinical trials and to bring SHAPE to practical application for CTCL in a major market country, provided that we reasonably believe the product is safe and effective. We believe that we can satisfy our obligation by out-licensing SHAPE to, or partnering SHAPE with, a third party. We are required to report to LLS on our efforts and results with respect to continuing development of SHAPE. Our failure to perform these diligence obligations, even if we successfully achieve the specified development milestones, would require us to pay back to LLS the total amount of the funding we received from them, unless an exception applies. If LLS were\nto claim that such failure occurred and we disagreed with such claim, the dispute would be settled through binding arbitration. In connection with the accounting for the acquisition of Shape Pharmaceuticals, we estimated the fair value of this potential obligation to be $200,000, which is included within contingent consideration and other liabilities in our December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 balance sheet.\nBecause the achievement and timing of our net sales is dependent on successful completion of our clinical programs and is therefore not fixed and determinable, our commitments under these agreements have not been included on our balance sheets or in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table above.\nIn July 2015, we assigned our worldwide patents for birinapant and SHAPE to two wholly-owned subsidiaries domiciled in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d), in consideration for payments to be made over a 10 year period. Although the assignment of the intellectual property rights did not result in any gain or loss in our consolidated financial statements, the transaction did result in a taxable gain in the United States and we are utilizing available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset this taxable gain. The UK subsidiaries will be responsible for the future development and commercialization of birinapant and SHAPE, and will recognize the net profits or losses generated from those activities.\nLicense Agreement with Princeton University\nIn November 2003, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Princeton University, subsequently amended in June 2004, August 2006 and October 2006, which grants us the rights to certain U.S. patents controlled by the university relating to SMAC-mimetic compounds, including birinapant, and a non-exclusive right to certain know-how and technology relating thereto. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense. To date, we have paid an aggregate of $100,000 in license fees under the license agreement. As part of the consideration paid, we issued to Princeton University 9,734 shares of our common stock and agreed to pay Princeton University certain royalties. In particular, we are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage of net product sales of 2.0% for direct licensed products, such as birinapant, and 0.5% of derived licensed products, if such products are covered by the applicable Princeton University patent rights. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to Princeton University by the amount of any royalties paid to a third-party in a pro rata manner, provided that the royalty rate may not be less than 1.0% of net sales for direct licensed products and 0.25% for derived licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties in the U.S. expires upon the expiration, lapse or abandonment of the last of the licensed patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of the direct licensed products. The obligation to pay royalties outside the U.S. expires, on a country by country basis, 10 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country. The licensed patent rights were developed using federal funds from the National Institutes of Health and are subject to certain overriding rights of and obligations to the federal government as provided in the Bayh-Dole Act. This agreement expires upon expiration of the last of the licensed patent rights in 2023 (absent extensions).\nThe agreement also requires that we pay to Princeton University 2.5% of the non-royalty consideration that we receive from a sublicensee. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop, test, obtain regulatory approval, manufacture, market and sell licensed products in all countries worldwide.\nLicense Agreement with Walter and Eliza Hall Institute\nIn January 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, or WEHI, in Melbourne, Australia for worldwide exclusive rights to a patent application and any patents issuing therefrom relating to a method of treating intracellular infections involving the administration of an IAP antagonist. WEHI will perform research and development services for which we will be making payments"}
