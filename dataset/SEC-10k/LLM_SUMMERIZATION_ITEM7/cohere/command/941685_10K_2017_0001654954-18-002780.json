Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including (without limitation) the disclosures made under the captions Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Risk Factors,\u201d and in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a pioneer and leader in the emerging market for biometrically enabled software-based identity management solutions. Using those human characteristics that are unique to us all, we create software that provides a highly reliable indication of a person's identity. Our flagship\u201d product is our patented IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae. Scalable for small city business or worldwide deployment, our IWS Biometric Engine is a multi-biometric software platform that is hardware and algorithm independent, enabling the enrollment and management of unlimited population sizes. It allows a user to utilize one or more biometrics on a seamlessly integrated platform. Our products are used to manage and issue secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, driver licenses and access control credentials. Our products also provide law enforcement with integrated mug shot, LiveScan fingerprint and investigative capabilities. We also provide comprehensive authentication security software using biometrics to secure physical and logical access to facilities or computer networks or Internet sites. Biometric technology is now an integral part of all markets we address and all of our products are integrated into the IWS Biometric Engine.\nWith the advent of cloud-based computing and the proliferation of smart mobile devices, which allow for reliable biometric capture and the need to secure access to data, products and services, the Company believes that the market for multi-biometric solutions will expand to encompass significant deployments of biometric systems in the commercial and consumer markets. The Company therefore intends to leverage the strength of its experience servicing existing government clients who have deployed the Company's products for large populations, as well as its foundational patent portfolio in the field of multi-modal biometrics and the fusion of multiple biometric algorithms, to address the growing commercial and consumer market.\nOur biometric technology is a core software component of an organization's security infrastructure and includes a multi-biometric identity management solution for enrolling, managing, identifying and verifying the identities of people by the physical characteristics of the human body. We develop, sell and support various identity management capabilities within government (federal, state and local), law enforcement, commercial enterprises, and transportation and aviation markets for identification and verification purposes. Our IWS Biometric Engine is a patented biometric identity management software platform for multi-biometric enrollment, management and authentication, managing population databases of virtually unlimited sizes. It is hardware agnostic and can utilize different types of biometric algorithms. It allows different types of biometrics to be operated at the same time on a seamlessly integrated platform. It is also offered as an SDK based search engine, enabling developers and system integrators to implement a biometric solution or integrate biometric capabilities into existing applications without having to derive biometric functionality from pre-existing applications. The IWS Biometric Engine combined with our secure credential platform, IWS EPI Builder, provides a comprehensive, integrated biometric and secure credential solution that can be leveraged for high-end applications such as passports, driver licenses, national IDs, and other secure documents.\nOur law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints and other biometrics as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless or web-based platform. We develop, sell and support a suite of modular software products used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to create and manage criminal history records and to investigate crime. Our IWS Law Enforcement solution consists of five software modules: Capture and Investigative modules, which provide a criminal booking system with related databases as well as the ability to create and print mug photo/SMT image lineups and electronic mugbooks; a Facial Recognition module, which uses biometric facial recognition to identify suspects; a Web module, which provides access to centrally stored records over the Internet in a connected or wireless fashion; and a LiveScan module, which incorporates LiveScan capabilities into IWS Law Enforcement providing integrated fingerprint and palm print biometric management for civil and law enforcement use. The IWS Biometric Engine is also available to our law enforcement clients and allows them to capture and search using other biometrics such as iris or DNA.\nOur secure credential solutions empower customers to create secure and smart digital identification documents with complete ID systems. We develop, sell and support software and design systems which utilize digital imaging and biometrics in the production of photo identification cards, credentials and identification systems. Our products in this market consist of IWS EPI Suite and IWS EPI Builder. These products allow for the production of digital identification cards and related databases and records and can be used by, among others, schools, airports, hospitals, corporations or governments. We have added the ability to incorporate multiple biometrics into the ID systems with the integration of IWS Biometric Engine to our secure credential product line.\nOur enterprise authentication software includes the IWS Desktop Security product, which is a comprehensive authentication management infrastructure solution providing added layers of security to workstations, networks and systems through advanced encryption and authentication technologies. IWS Desktop Security is optimized to enhance network security and usability, and uses multi-factor authentication methods to protect access, verify identity and help secure the computing environment without sacrificing ease-of-use features such as quick login. Additionally, IWS Desktop Security provides an easy integration with various smart card-based credentials including the Common Access Card ( CAC\u201d), Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ( HSPD-12\u201d), Personal Identity Verification ( PIV\u201d) credential, and Transportation Worker Identification Credential ( TWIC\u201d) with an organization's access control process. IWS Desktop Security provides the crucial end-point component of a Logical Access Control System ( LACS\u201d), and when combined with a Physical Access Control System ( PACS\u201d), organizations benefit from a complete door to desktop access control and security model.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company's financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.\nSignificant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory carrying values, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, accounting for loss contingencies, recoverability of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and amortization periods, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share based payments, assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value differential of the Preferred Stock Exchange, revenue and cost of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations.\nThe following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our consolidated results of operations. We recognize revenue from the following major revenue sources:\n\u25cf\nLong-term fixed-price contracts involving significant customization;\n\u25cf\nFixed-price contracts involving minimal customization;\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing;\n\u25cf\nSales of computer hardware and identification media; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d).\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are consistent with GAAP including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition,\u201d ASC 605-35 Revenue Recognition, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 104,\u201d and ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Element Arrangements.\u201d Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long-term, fixed-price contracts involving significant amounts of hardware and software customization using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs upon completion. The primary components of costs incurred are third party software and direct labor cost including fringe benefits. Revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets under Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current liabilities under Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Revenue from contracts for which the Company cannot reliably estimate total costs, or there are not significant amounts of customization, are recognized upon completion. For contracts that require significant amounts of customization that the Company accounts for under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, the Company defers revenue recognition until customer acceptance is received. For contracts containing either extended or dependent payment terms, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as payment has been received by the Company. The Company also generates non-recurring revenue from the licensing of its software. Software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement, upon deliverance, when fees are fixed and determinable, when collectability is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled. The Company also generates revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer. The Company's revenue from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain and collectability of the related receivable is probable. Amounts collected in advance for maintenance services are included in current liabilities under Deferred revenues.\u201d Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and the age of the accounts receivable balances and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nValuation of Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company accounts for its intangible assets under the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with a definite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360-10-05 and intangible assets with an indefinite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360. In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill, or the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is tested for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (referred to as a component) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. The Company's reporting unit is at the entity level. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company uses fair value methodologies to establish fair values.\nWe assess impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u25cf\nSignificant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results;\n\u25cf\nSignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business; and\n\u25cf\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a need, tests the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. A two-step impairment test is used to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The first step was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value, employing the market approach, of the Company's reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The Company determined that its only reporting unit is Identity Management. Based on the results of this impairment test, the Company determined that its goodwill assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company's management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company's products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nThere are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results. Significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenues and operating expenses. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2017, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in general and administrative, sales and marketing, engineering and customer service expenses based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company's Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company's Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 ranged from 58% to 103%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved simplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. The expected term used by the Company to value the grants issued in 2017, 2016 and 2015 as computed by this method was 5.17 years. The effect of the difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company's Black-Scholes calculations were 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company's common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 6.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nASC 740-10 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our analysis of income tax reserves reflects the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, if any, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining the Company's provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation's ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company's use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent ownership changes,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, in 1991, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2011 and 2012, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets to zero relating to its federal and state research credits because of such limitations. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nFair-Value Measurements. The Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLevel 1\n</td> <td>\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLevel 2\n</td> <td>\nApplies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLevel 3\n</td> <td>\nPrices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Determining whether a fair value measurement is based on Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 inputs is important because certain disclosures are applicable only to those fair value measurements that use Level 3 inputs. The use of Level 3 inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions.\nFor a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nComparison of Results for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nProduct Revenue\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\nNet Product Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $1,248\n</td> <td> $391\n</td> <td> 46%\n</td> <td> $857\n</td> <td> $(744)\n</td> <td> (46)%\n</td> <td> $1,601\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $94\n</td> <td> $26\n</td> <td> 38%\n</td> <td> $68\n</td> <td> $34\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td> $34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $272\n</td> <td> $(52)\n</td> <td> (16)%\n</td> <td> $324\n</td> <td> $(233)\n</td> <td> (42)%\n</td> <td> $557\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net product revenue\n</td> <td> $1,614\n</td> <td> $365\n</td> <td> 29%\n</td> <td> $1,249\n</td> <td> $(943)\n</td> <td> (43)%\n</td> <td> $2,192\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware and royalty revenue increased 46% or approximately $391,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase is due to higher project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $397,000, higher sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $5,000, higher law enforcement project revenue of approximately $8,000 offset by lower royalty revenue of approximately $19,000.\nSoftware and royalty revenue decreased 46% or approximately $744,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due to lower project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $542,000, lower sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $93,000, lower royalty revenue of approximately $84,000 and lower law enforcement project revenue of approximately $25,000.\nRevenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 38% or approximately $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nDuring the 2016 period, revenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 100% or approximately $34,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Such revenue decreased 16% or approximately $52,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to the completion of the service element in identity management project solutions in the 2015 period.\nServices revenue decreased 42% or approximately $233,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to the completion of the service elements in certain identity management project solutions.\nWe believe that the period-to-period fluctuations of identity management software revenue in project-oriented solutions are largely due to the timing of government procurement with respect to the various programs we are pursuing. Although no assurances can be given, based on management's current visibility into the timing of potential government procurements and potential partnerships and current pilot programs, we believe that we will see an increase in government procurement and implementations with respect to identity management initiatives during 2018; however, government procurement initiatives, implementations and pilots are frequently delayed and extended, as was the case in the year ended December 31, 2017, and we cannot predict the timing of such initiatives.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued our efforts to move the Biometric Engine into cloud and mobile markets and to expand our end-user market into non-government sectors including commercial, consumer and healthcare applications. Our approach to the markets we serve is to partner with larger integrators as resellers who have both the infrastructure and resources to sell into the worldwide market. We rely upon these partners for guidance as to when they expect revenues for our products to begin to ramp. For those opportunities that are approaching implementation, we are being told by our partners that we should expect revenues to commence in the first quarter of 2018.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\nNet Maintenance Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance Revenue\n</td> <td> $2,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> <td> $2,563\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td> $2,577\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance revenue was approximately $2,679,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $2,563,000 and $2,577,000 for the corresponding periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,311,000 as compared to $1,181,000 for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in identity management maintenance revenue of approximately $130,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,368,000 for the twelve months ended December 2017 as compared to $1,382,000 for the comparable period in 2016. This decrease of approximately $14,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, maintenance revenue decreased approximately $14,000 as compared to the comparable period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,181,000 as compared to $1,114,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in identity management revenue of approximately $67,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,382,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,463,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease of approximately $81,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nWe anticipate growth of our maintenance revenue through the retention of existing customers combined with the continued expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of project-oriented work, however we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth.\nCost of Product Revenue\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\nCost of Product\nRevenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $39\n</td> <td> $(39)\n</td> <td> (50)%\n</td> <td> $78\n</td> <td> $(11)\n</td> <td> (12)%\n</td> <td> $89\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $64\n</td> <td> $21\n</td> <td> 49%\n</td> <td> $43\n</td> <td> $(2)\n</td> <td> (4)%\n</td> <td> $45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $49\n</td> <td> $(73)\n</td> <td> (60)%\n</td> <td> $122\n</td> <td> $(861)\n</td> <td> (88)%\n</td> <td> $983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of services product revenue\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of product revenue\n</td> <td> $152\n</td> <td> $(91)\n</td> <td> (37)%\n</td> <td> $243\n</td> <td> $(874)\n</td> <td> (78)%\n</td> <td> $1,117\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total product revenue\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of software and royalty product revenue decreased approximately $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The cost of software and royalty revenue decreased approximately $11,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to decreases in third party software costs despite higher sales of software. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nThe cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $21,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $26,000. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales decreased by approximately $2,000, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 despite higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $34,000 primarily due to the 2015 period containing approximately $21,000 in hardware equipment written off due to substantial doubt as to recoverability.\nCost of services revenue decreased approximately $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease reflects lower professional service revenue of approximately $52,000. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of services revenue decreased 88% or approximately $861,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease reflects higher professional service revenue of approximately $322,000 due to the positive impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with higher level and more costly service resources utilized in the generation of such non-recurring revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Also contributing to this decrease was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\nMaintenance cost\nof revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total maintenance cost of revenue\n</td> <td> $839\n</td> <td> $12\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td> $827\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td> $827\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n</td> <td> 31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of maintenance revenue increased approximately $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting principally from higher labor costs driven primarily by the utilization of more expensive labor resources required to fulfill maintenance contract obligations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nProduct Gross Profit\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\nProduct gross profit\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $1,209\n</td> <td> $430\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> $779\n</td> <td> $(733)\n</td> <td> (48)%\n</td> <td> $1,512\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n</td> <td> 97%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $30\n</td> <td> $5\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td> $25\n</td> <td> $36\n</td> <td> 327%\n</td> <td> $(11)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $223\n</td> <td> $21\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> <td> $202\n</td> <td> $628\n</td> <td> 147%\n</td> <td> $(426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of services product revenue\n</td> <td> 82%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product gross profit\n</td> <td> $1,462\n</td> <td> $456\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> <td> $1,006\n</td> <td> $(69)\n</td> <td> (6)%\n</td> <td> $1,075\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total product revenue\n</td> <td> 91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware and royalty gross profit increased 55% or approximately $430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher software and royalty product revenue of approximately $391,000 combined with lower cost of software and royalty revenue of approximately $39,000. This relationship is reflective of approximately $339,000 in license revenue with extremely low costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nSoftware and royalty gross profit decreased 48% or approximately $733,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to lower software and royalty product revenue of approximately $744,000. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $26,000 combined with corresponding higher cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the 2015 period. This increase resulted from lower sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $34,000 combined with corresponding lower cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nServices gross profit increased approximately $21,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due to lower service revenue of approximately $52,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This inverse relationship is cause by the recognition of certain service revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 combined with the related costs of these revenues being written off in 2015 due to significant doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nServices gross profit increased 147% or approximately $628,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to lower service revenue of approximately $233,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $861,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in service revenue and uncharacteristically high cost of service revenue in the 2015 period reflect the impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with significant costs incurred from implementation challenges. The Company's contract with this one customer in the 2015 period also included software product revenue of approximately $440,000, offset by minimal costs. Also contributing to the services gross profit increase was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nMaintenance Gross Profit\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\nMaintenance gross profit\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total maintenance gross profit\n</td> <td> $ 1,840\n</td> <td> $104\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td> $1,736\n</td> <td> $(14)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td> $1,750\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margins related to maintenance revenue were 69% and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The tax benefit reflects the reversal of a prior year accrual related to foreign taxes which expired due to the expiration of the statute of limitation on this foreign tax liability. The 2016 tax expense relates to taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by research and development tax credits generated in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have incurred consolidated pre-tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and have incurred operating losses in all prior periods. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit from such losses will not be realized. Accordingly, we did not record a benefit for income taxes for these periods.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt, including our Lines of Credit (defined below). Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of SaaS capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We expect that, as our revenues grow, our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve and sustain income from operations.\nReliance on Lines of Credit\nIn March 2013, the Company and Neal Goldman, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Goldman\u201d), entered into a line of credit (the Goldman Line of Credit\u201d), as amended, with available borrowings of up to $5.5 million, and a maturity date, as amended, of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman has the right to convert the outstanding principal amount due under the terms of the Goldman Line of Credit, plus any accrued but unpaid interest due thereunder, into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs consideration for the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman was granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,230,410 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the Line of Credit Warrants\u201d). The Goldman Line of Credit Warrants have exercise prices ranging between $0.95 and $2.25 per share and 177,778 of these warrants expired unexercised.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: term of two years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.58%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility between 74% and 79%. The Company recorded the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants as a deferred financing fee of approximately $580,000 to be amortized over the life of the Goldman Line of Credit.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded an aggregate of approximately $11,000 and $48,000, respectively in deferred financing fee amortization expense which is recorded as a component of interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company has also entered into an unsecured line of credit with Charles Crocker, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Crocker\u201d), which, as amended, provides for available borrowings of up to $500,000 (the Crocker LOC\u201d). All amounts due under the terms of the Crocker LOC, as amended, are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs the amendments to the Goldman Line of Credit and the Crocker LOC (\"Lines of Credit\") resulted in an increase to the borrowing capacity of the Lines of Credit, the Company adjusted the amortization period of any remaining unamortized deferred costs and note discounts to the term of the new arrangement.\nThe Company evaluated the Lines of Credit and determined that the instruments contain a contingent beneficial conversion feature, i.e. an embedded conversion right that enables the holder to obtain the underlying Common Stock at a price below market value. The beneficial conversion feature is contingent as the terms of the conversion do not permit the Company to compute the number of shares that the holder would receive if the contingent event occurs (i.e. future borrowings under the Lines of Credit). The Company has considered the accounting for this contingent beneficial conversion feature using the guidance in ASC 470, Debt. The guidance in ASC 470 states that a contingent beneficial conversion feature in an instrument shall not be recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved. The beneficial conversion features of future borrowings under the Lines of Credit will be measured using the intrinsic value calculated at the date the contingency is resolved using the conversion price and trading value of the Company's Common Stock at the date the Lines of Credit were issued (commitment date). Pursuant to borrowings made during the 2015 year, the Company recognized approximately $146,000 in beneficial conversion feature as debt discount. As a result of the retirement of all amounts outstanding under the Lines of Credit in 2015, the Company recognized all remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $385,000 as a component of interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2015. As a result of $2,650,000 in borrowings under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $219,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of additional borrowings of $3,350,000 under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded approximately $302,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accreted approximately $198,000 and $97,000, respectively, of debt discount as a component of interest expense.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's activity under its Lines of Credit for the periods indicated:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> Balance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowing under Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> 2,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $2,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> 3,350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $6,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently do not anticipate generating sufficient revenue and profit to repay these borrowings in full when due. Therefore, unless the holders of the Lines of Credit convert any outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock, we will need to seek an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit on or before December 31, 2018. If we are unable to extend the maturity date of the Lines of Credit, we will be required to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. No assurances can be given that any such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. At this time, we do not have any commitments for alternative financing or for an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit.\nGoing Concern and Management's Plan\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $415,000, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2016. Our principal sources of liquidity at December 31, 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $7,317,000, compared to available borrowings under our Lines of Credit of $3,350,000, and approximately $1,586,000 of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nConsidering our projected cash requirements, and assuming we are unable to generate incremental revenue, our available cash may be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address our working capital requirements, management may seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities or may seek strategic or other transactions intended to increase shareholder value. There are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company's ability to continue to raise capital and generate positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8,703,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $7,911,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7,183,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $10,069,000 and an increase in operating cash from changes in assets and liabilities of $195,000. We also incurred $1,171,000 in net non-cash costs including $1,151,000 in stock based compensation, $209,000 in debt issuance cost amortization and debt discount amortization, $15,000 in provision for losses on accounts receivable and $68,000 in depreciation and amortization offset by $272,000 of non-cash income primarily from the write-off of certain accrued expenses due to the expiration of the statute of limitations of $222,000 and $50,000 from the sale of one of the Company's non-utilized trademarks. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used cash of $282,000 from increases in current assets and generated cash of $477,000 through increases in current liabilities and deferred revenues, excluding debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $9,527,000 and an increase in operating cash from changes in assets and liabilities of $383,000.

We also incurred $1,923,000 in net non-cash costs including $1,040,000 in stock-based compensation (which includes $80,000 in warrants modified in lieu of cash as compensation), $438,000 in debt issuance cost amortization and debt discount amortization, $281,000 related to the write down of capitalized labor inventory to net realizable value, and $164,000 in depreciation and amortization. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated cash of $523,000 from reductions in current assets and used cash of $1,095,000 through reductions in current liabilities and deferred revenues, excluding debt.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $45,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, $49,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $87,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we used cash to fund capital expenditures of computer equipment, software and furniture and fixtures of $5,000, $49,000 and $87,000, respectively. This level of equipment purchases resulted primarily from the replacement of older equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated cash of $50,000 from the sale of one of our non-utilized trademarks.\nFinancing Activities\nWe generated cash of $14,495,000 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6,195,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $10,337,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated cash of $11,000,000 from the Series A Financing offset by $63,000 in offering costs, generated $3,350,000 from borrowings under the Lines of Credit and generated approximately $259,000 from the exercise of 369,004 options resulting in the issuance of 369,004 shares of Common Stock. We used cash of approximately $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated cash of $2,000,000 from the Series F Financing offset by $21,000 in offering costs, and $1,625,000 from the Series G Financing, offset by $11,000 in offering costs, $3,000 from the exercise of 12,626 Common Stock options and $2,650,000 from borrowings under the Lines of Credit. We used cash of $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated cash of $10,022,000 from the Series E Financing offset by $67,000 in offering costs, $33,000 from the exercise of 39,705 Common Stock options and $750,000 from borrowings under the Goldman Line of Credit offset by the repayment of $350,000 under the Goldman Line of Credit. We used cash of $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred.\nDebt\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $5,774,000 in outstanding debt, net of unamortized debt discount of approximately $226,000 and in addition we owed approximately $527,000 in related accrued interest.\nContractual Obligations\nTotal contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Due by Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\nMore than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> $1,770\n</td> <td> $607\n</td> <td> $847\n</td> <td> $316\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advances (including accrued interest of approximately $527,000) under related party lines of credit\n</td> <td> $6,527\n</td> <td> 6,527\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $8,297\n</td> <td> $7,134\n</td> <td> $847\n</td> <td> $316\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Property Leases\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California where we occupy 9,927 square feet of office space. This facility is leased through October 2018 at a cost of approximately $30,000 per month. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we also occupied and leased the following spaces at December 31, 2017:\n\u25cf\n1,508 square feet in Ottawa, Province of Ontario, Canada, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on March 31, 2021. This lease was renewed in April 2016 for a five-year period ending on March 31, 2021. Renewal terms were substantially unchanged from the existing lease;\n\u25cf\n9,720 square feet in Portland, Oregon, at a cost of approximately $21,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on December 31, 2021. This lease was renewed in September 2017, resulting in an additional 1,675 feet, an increase from approximately $18,000 to approximately $21,000 per month and the extension of the term from October 2018 to December 2021; and\n\u25cf\nsquare feet of office space in Mexico City, Mexico, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per month until November 30, 2018.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation related to equity options and restricted stock has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> $19\n</td> <td> $20\n</td> <td> $15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $1,094\n</td> <td> $1,162\n</td> <td> $960\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d), or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company's management believes the impact of recently issued standards not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption. See Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs, and we do not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses, particularly labor and operating expenses, could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers and end users.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- The case study analyzes the financial statements of a company over a three-year period, including income statements,

OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including (without limitation) the disclosures made under the captions Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Risk Factors,\u201d and in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a pioneer and leader in the emerging market for biometrically enabled software-based identity management solutions. Using those human characteristics that are unique to us all, we create software that provides a highly reliable indication of a person's identity. Our flagship\u201d product is our patented IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae. Scalable for small city business or worldwide deployment, our IWS Biometric Engine is a multi-biometric software platform that is hardware and algorithm independent, enabling the enrollment and management of unlimited population sizes. It allows a user to utilize one or more biometrics on a seamlessly integrated platform. Our products are used to manage and issue secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, driver licenses and access control credentials. Our products also provide law enforcement with integrated mug shot, LiveScan fingerprint and investigative capabilities. We also provide comprehensive authentication security software using biometrics to secure physical and logical access to facilities or computer networks or Internet sites. Biometric technology is now an integral part of all markets we address and all of our products are integrated into the IWS Biometric Engine.\nWith the advent of cloud-based computing and the proliferation of smart mobile devices, which allow for reliable biometric capture and the need to secure access to data, products and services, the Company believes that the market for multi-biometric solutions will expand to encompass significant deployments of biometric systems in the commercial and consumer markets. The Company therefore intends to leverage the strength of its experience servicing existing government clients who have deployed the Company's products for large populations, as well as its foundational patent portfolio in the field of multi-modal biometrics and the fusion of multiple biometric algorithms, to address the growing commercial and consumer market.\nOur biometric technology is a core software component of an organization's security infrastructure and includes a multi-biometric identity management solution for enrolling, managing, identifying and verifying the identities of people by the physical characteristics of the human body. We develop, sell and support various identity management capabilities within government (federal, state and local), law enforcement, commercial enterprises, and transportation and aviation markets for identification and verification purposes. Our IWS Biometric Engine is a patented biometric identity management software platform for multi-biometric enrollment, management and authentication, managing population databases of virtually unlimited sizes. It is hardware agnostic and can utilize different types of biometric algorithms. It allows different types of biometrics to be operated at the same time on a seamlessly integrated platform. It is also offered as an SDK based search engine, enabling developers and system integrators to implement a biometric solution or integrate biometric capabilities into existing applications without having to derive biometric functionality from pre-existing applications. The IWS Biometric Engine combined with our secure credential platform, IWS EPI Builder, provides a comprehensive, integrated biometric and secure credential solution that can be leveraged for high-end applications such as passports, driver licenses, national IDs, and other secure documents.\nOur law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints and other biometrics as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless or web-based platform. We develop, sell and support a suite of modular software products used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to create and manage criminal history records and to investigate crime. Our IWS Law Enforcement solution consists of five software modules: Capture and Investigative modules, which provide a criminal booking system with related databases as well as the ability to create and print mug photo/SMT image lineups and electronic mugbooks; a Facial Recognition module, which uses biometric facial recognition to identify suspects; a Web module, which provides access to centrally stored records over the Internet in a connected or wireless fashion; and a LiveScan module, which incorporates LiveScan capabilities into IWS Law Enforcement providing integrated fingerprint and palm print biometric management for civil and law enforcement use. The IWS Biometric Engine is also available to our law enforcement clients and allows them to capture and search using other biometrics such as iris or DNA.\nOur secure credential solutions empower customers to create secure and smart digital identification documents with complete ID systems. We develop, sell and support software and design systems which utilize digital imaging and biometrics in the production of photo identification cards, credentials and identification systems. Our products in this market consist of IWS EPI Suite and IWS EPI Builder. These products allow for the production of digital identification cards and related databases and records and can be used by, among others, schools, airports, hospitals, corporations or governments. We have added the ability to incorporate multiple biometrics into the ID systems with the integration of IWS Biometric Engine to our secure credential product line.\nOur enterprise authentication software includes the IWS Desktop Security product, which is a comprehensive authentication management infrastructure solution providing added layers of security to workstations, networks and systems through advanced encryption and authentication technologies. IWS Desktop Security is optimized to enhance network security and usability, and uses multi-factor authentication methods to protect access, verify identity and help secure the computing environment without sacrificing ease-of-use features such as quick login. Additionally, IWS Desktop Security provides an easy integration with various smart card-based credentials including the Common Access Card ( CAC\u201d), Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ( HSPD-12\u201d), Personal Identity Verification ( PIV\u201d) credential, and Transportation Worker Identification Credential ( TWIC\u201d) with an organization's access control process. IWS Desktop Security provides the crucial end-point component of a Logical Access Control System ( LACS\u201d), and when combined with a Physical Access Control System ( PACS\u201d), organizations benefit from a complete door to desktop access control and security model.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company's financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.\nSignificant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory carrying values, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, accounting for loss contingencies, recoverability of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and amortization periods, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share based payments, assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value differential of the Preferred Stock Exchange, revenue and cost of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations.\nThe following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our consolidated results of operations. We recognize revenue from the following major revenue sources:\n\u25cf\nLong-term fixed-price contracts involving significant customization;\n\u25cf\nFixed-price contracts involving minimal customization;\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing;\n\u25cf\nSales of computer hardware and identification media; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d).\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are consistent with GAAP including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition,\u201d ASC 605-35 Revenue Recognition, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 104,\u201d and ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Element Arrangements.\u201d Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long-term, fixed-price contracts involving significant amounts of hardware and software customization using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs upon completion. The primary components of costs incurred are third party software and direct labor cost including fringe benefits. Revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets under Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current liabilities under Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Revenue from contracts for which the Company cannot reliably estimate total costs, or there are not significant amounts of customization, are recognized upon completion. For contracts that require significant amounts of customization that the Company accounts for under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, the Company defers revenue recognition until customer acceptance is received. For contracts containing either extended or dependent payment terms, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as payment has been received by the Company. The Company also generates non-recurring revenue from the licensing of its software. Software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement, upon deliverance, when fees are fixed and determinable, when collectability is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled. The Company also generates revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer. The Company's revenue from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain and collectability of the related receivable is probable. Amounts collected in advance for maintenance services are included in current liabilities under Deferred revenues.\u201d Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and the age of the accounts receivable balances and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nValuation of Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company accounts for its intangible assets under the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with a definite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360-10-05 and intangible assets with an indefinite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360. In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill, or the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is tested for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (referred to as a component) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. The Company's reporting unit is at the entity level. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company uses fair value methodologies to establish fair values.\nWe assess impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u25cf\nSignificant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results;\n\u25cf\nSignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business; and\n\u25cf\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a need, tests the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. A two-step impairment test is used to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The first step was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value, employing the market approach, of the Company's reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The Company determined that its only reporting unit is Identity Management. Based on the results of this impairment test, the Company determined that its goodwill assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company's management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company's products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nThere are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results. Significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenues and operating expenses. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2017, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in general and administrative, sales and marketing, engineering and customer service expenses based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company's Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company's Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 ranged from 58% to 103%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved simplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. The expected term used by the Company to value the grants issued in 2017, 2016 and 2015 as computed by this method was 5.17 years. The effect of the difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company's Black-Scholes calculations were 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company's common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 6.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nASC 740-10 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our analysis of income tax reserves reflects the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, if any, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining the Company's provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation's ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company's use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent ownership changes,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, in 1991, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2011 and 2012, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets to zero relating to its federal and state research credits because of such limitations. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nFair-Value Measurements. The Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\n Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). \nAssessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Determining whether a fair value measurement is based on Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 inputs is important because certain disclosures are applicable only to those fair value measurements that use Level 3 inputs. The use of Level 3 inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions.\nFor a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nComparison of Results for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nProduct Revenue\n\nSoftware and royalty revenue increased 46% or approximately $391,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase is due to higher project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $397,000, higher sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $5,000, higher law enforcement project revenue of approximately $8,000 offset by lower royalty revenue of approximately $19,000.\nSoftware and royalty revenue decreased 46% or approximately $744,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due to lower project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $542,000, lower sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $93,000, lower royalty revenue of approximately $84,000 and lower law enforcement project revenue of approximately $25,000.\nRevenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 38% or approximately $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nDuring the 2016 period, revenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 100% or approximately $34,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Such revenue decreased 16% or approximately $52,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to the completion of the service element in identity management project solutions in the 2015 period.\nServices revenue decreased 42% or approximately $233,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to the completion of the service elements in certain identity management project solutions.\nWe believe that the period-to-period fluctuations of identity management software revenue in project-oriented solutions are largely due to the timing of government procurement with respect to the various programs we are pursuing. Although no assurances can be given, based on management's current visibility into the timing of potential government procurements and potential partnerships and current pilot programs, we believe that we will see an increase in government procurement and implementations with respect to identity management initiatives during 2018; however, government procurement initiatives, implementations and pilots are frequently delayed and extended, as was the case in the year ended December 31, 2017, and we cannot predict the timing of such initiatives.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued our efforts to move the Biometric Engine into cloud and mobile markets and to expand our end-user market into non-government sectors including commercial, consumer and healthcare applications. Our approach to the markets we serve is to partner with larger integrators as resellers who have both the infrastructure and resources to sell into the worldwide market. We rely upon these partners for guidance as to when they expect revenues for our products to begin to ramp. For those opportunities that are approaching implementation, we are being told by our partners that we should expect revenues to commence in the first quarter of 2018.\nMaintenance Revenue\n\nMaintenance revenue was approximately $2,679,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $2,563,000 and $2,577,000 for the corresponding periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,311,000 as compared to $1,181,000 for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in identity management maintenance revenue of approximately $130,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,368,000 for the twelve months ended December 2017 as compared to $1,382,000 for the comparable period in 2016. This decrease of approximately $14,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, maintenance revenue decreased approximately $14,000 as compared to the comparable period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,181,000 as compared to $1,114,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in identity management revenue of approximately $67,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,382,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,463,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease of approximately $81,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nWe anticipate growth of our maintenance revenue through the retention of existing customers combined with the continued expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of project-oriented work, however we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth.\nCost of Product Revenue\n\nThe cost of software and royalty product revenue decreased approximately $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The cost of software and royalty revenue decreased approximately $11,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to decreases in third party software costs despite higher sales of software. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nThe cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $21,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $26,000. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales decreased by approximately $2,000, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 despite higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $34,000 primarily due to the 2015 period containing approximately $21,000 in hardware equipment written off due to substantial doubt as to recoverability.\nCost of services revenue decreased approximately $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease reflects lower professional service revenue of approximately $52,000. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of services revenue decreased 88% or approximately $861,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease reflects higher professional service revenue of approximately $322,000 due to the positive impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with higher level and more costly service resources utilized in the generation of such non-recurring revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Also contributing to this decrease was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\n\nCost of maintenance revenue increased approximately $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting principally from higher labor costs driven primarily by the utilization of more expensive labor resources required to fulfill maintenance contract obligations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nProduct Gross Profit\n\nSoftware and royalty gross profit increased 55% or approximately $430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher software and royalty product revenue of approximately $391,000 combined with lower cost of software and royalty revenue of approximately $39,000. This relationship is reflective of approximately $339,000 in license revenue with extremely low costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nSoftware and royalty gross profit decreased 48% or approximately $733,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to lower software and royalty product revenue of approximately $744,000. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $26,000 combined with corresponding higher cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the 2015 period. This increase resulted from lower sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $34,000 combined with corresponding lower cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nServices gross profit increased approximately $21,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due to lower service revenue of approximately $52,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This inverse relationship is cause by the recognition of certain service revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 combined with the related costs of these revenues being written off in 2015 due to significant doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nServices gross profit increased 147% or approximately $628,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to lower service revenue of approximately $233,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $861,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in service revenue and uncharacteristically high cost of service revenue in the 2015 period reflect the impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with significant costs incurred from implementation challenges. The Company's contract with this one customer in the 2015 period also included software product revenue of approximately $440,000, offset by minimal costs. Also contributing to the services gross profit increase was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nMaintenance Gross Profit\n\nGross margins related to maintenance revenue were 69% and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The dollar increase of approximately $104,000 for the 2017 year as compared to the corresponding 2016 period primarily resulted from higher maintenance revenue of approximately $116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Gross margins related to maintenance revenue were 68% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The decrease of approximately $14,000 for the 2016 year as compared to the corresponding 2015 period primarily resulted from lower maintenance revenue of approximately $14,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nOperating Expense\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense is comprised primarily of salaries and other employee-related costs for executive, financial, and other infrastructure personnel. General legal, accounting and consulting services, insurance, occupancy and communication costs are also included with general and administrative expense.\nThe dollar increase of approximately $470,000 in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, is comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nIncrease in personnel related expense of approximately $170,000 due to head count increases;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in financing related expenses of approximately $160,000;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in professional fees including consulting services and contract services of approximately $27,000 due primarily to decreases in audit fees of $75,000 offset by increases in legal fees of approximately $6,000, increases in various consulting, contract services and corporate expenses of approximately $82,000 and increases in patent related fees of approximately $14,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $59,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in travel, insurances, licenses, dues, rent, and office related costs of approximately $172,000.\nThe dollar increase of approximately $285,000 in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, is comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nIncrease in personnel related expense of approximately $331,000 due to head count increases;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in professional fees including consulting services and contract services of approximately $101,000 due primarily to decreases in patent related expenses of approximately $134,000, decreases in legal fees of approximately $14,000, decreases in various consulting, contract services and corporate expenses of approximately $34,000, offset by increases in public/inventory relation fees of approximately $35,000 and auditing fees of approximately $46,000;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $96,000; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in travel, insurances, licenses, dues, rent, and office related costs of approximately $41,000.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on achieving additional future operating efficiencies by reviewing and improving upon existing business processes and evaluating our cost structure. We believe these efforts will allow us to continue to gradually decrease our level of general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of the salaries, commissions, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and travel expense of our sales, marketing, and business development.\nThe dollar decrease in sales and marketing expense of approximately $205,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, is primarily comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel related expense of approximately $45,000 due primarily to decreases in headcount;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in professional services of approximately $194,000 resulting primarily from decreased utilization of sales consultants;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in contract services and office related expense of approximately $18,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in our Mexico sales office related expense of approximately $39,000 due primarily to lower contractor utilization for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable period in 2016 due to the completion of certain identity management projects;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in travel and trade show expense of approximately $33,000 and increases in advertising due and subscriptions and other selling expense of approximately $26,000; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $4,000.\nWe anticipate that the level of expense incurred for sales and marketing during the year ended December 31, 2018 will increase as we pursue large project solution opportunities.\nThe dollar increase in sales and marketing expense of approximately $230,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nIncrease in personnel related expense of approximately $49,000 due primarily to increases in headcount;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in professional services of approximately $195,000 resulting primarily from increased utilization of sales consultants;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in contract services and office related expense of approximately $50,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in our Mexico sales office related expense of approximately $65,000 due primarily to lower contractor utilization for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015 due to the completion of certain identity management projects;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in travel and trade show expense and other selling expense of approximately $52,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $53,000.\nWe anticipate that the level of expense incurred for sales and marketing during the year ended December 31, 2017 will increase as we pursue large project solution opportunities.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and outside contractors for new product development, product enhancements, custom integration work and related facility costs.\nResearch and development expense increased approximately $621,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel expenditures of approximately $72,000 due to the full year effect of several headcount changes combined with higher levels of capitalized labor for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable period in 2016;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in contractor fees and contract services of approximately $570,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $4,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in office related expense including communications, engineering tools and supplies, dues and subscriptions and travel of approximately $127,000.\nResearch and development expense increased approximately $689,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to the following major components:\n\u25cf\nIncrease in personnel expenditures of approximately $702,000 due to the full year effect of several headcount increases in mid-2015 combined with lower levels of capitalized labor for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015 due to the completion of certain identity management projects;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in contractor fees and contract services of approximately $51,000;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in stock-based compensation of approximately $48,000; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in office related expense and travel of approximately $112,000.\nOur level of expenditures in research and development reflects our belief that to maintain our competitive position in markets characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement, we must continue to invest significant resources in new systems and software as well as continue to enhance existing products.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $61,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $35,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The relatively small amount of depreciation and amortization in both periods reflects the relatively small property and equipment carrying value.\nInterest Expense (Income), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized interest income of $43,000 and interest expense of $634,000. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized interest income of $3,000 and interest expense of $248,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized interest income of $7,000 and interest expense of $454,000.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $11,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $198,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $425,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $48,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $97,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $102,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $53,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $385,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $12,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $4,000 related to miscellaneous interest charges.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized other income of approximately $125,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 is comprised of approximately $75,000 from the write off of certain accrued expenses due the expiration of the legal statute of limitations on such liabilities. Other income also includes $50,000 from the sale of one of the Company's non-utilized trademarks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income of approximately $201,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 is comprised of approximately $201,000 from the write off of certain accrued expenses due the expiration of the legal statute of limitations on such liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized other income of approximately $145,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 is comprised of approximately $46,000 relating to the litigation settlement of certain patent infringement matters in favor of the Company and approximately $99,000 from the recovery of a previously written-off accounts receivable.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net benefit of approximately $124,000 from income taxes, as compared to an expense of $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and expense of $22,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our benefit for income taxes of $124,000 and tax expense of $21,000, respectively. The tax benefit reflects the reversal of a prior year accrual related to foreign taxes which expired due to the expiration of the statute of limitation on this foreign tax liability. The 2016 tax expense relates to taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by research and development tax credits generated in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have incurred consolidated pre-tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and have incurred operating losses in all prior periods. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit from such losses will not be realized. Accordingly, we did not record a benefit for income taxes for these periods.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt, including our Lines of Credit (defined below). Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of SaaS capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We expect that, as our revenues grow, our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve and sustain income from operations.\nReliance on Lines of Credit\nIn March 2013, the Company and Neal Goldman, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Goldman\u201d), entered into a line of credit (the Goldman Line of Credit\u201d), as amended, with available borrowings of up to $5.5 million, and a maturity date, as amended, of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman has the right to convert the outstanding principal amount due under the terms of the Goldman Line of Credit, plus any accrued but unpaid interest due thereunder, into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs consideration for the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman was granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,230,410 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the Line of Credit Warrants\u201d). The Goldman Line of Credit Warrants have exercise prices ranging between $0.95 and $2.25 per share and 177,778 of these warrants expired unexercised.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: term of two years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.58%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility between 74% and 79%. The Company recorded the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants as a deferred financing fee of approximately $580,000 to be amortized over the life of the Goldman Line of Credit.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded an aggregate of approximately $11,000 and $48,000, respectively in deferred financing fee amortization expense which is recorded as a component of interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company has also entered into an unsecured line of credit with Charles Crocker, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Crocker\u201d), which, as amended, provides for available borrowings of up to $500,000 (the Crocker LOC\u201d). All amounts due under the terms of the Crocker LOC, as amended, are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs the amendments to the Goldman Line of Credit and the Crocker LOC (\"Lines of Credit\") resulted in an increase to the borrowing capacity of the Lines of Credit, the Company adjusted the amortization period of any remaining unamortized deferred costs and note discounts to the term of the new arrangement.\nThe Company evaluated the Lines of Credit and determined that the instruments contain a contingent beneficial conversion feature, i.e. an embedded conversion right that enables the holder to obtain the underlying Common Stock at a price below market value. The beneficial conversion feature is contingent as the terms of the conversion do not permit the Company to compute the number of shares that the holder would receive if the contingent event occurs (i.e. future borrowings under the Lines of Credit). The Company has considered the accounting for this contingent beneficial conversion feature using the guidance in ASC 470, Debt. The guidance in ASC 470 states that a contingent beneficial conversion feature in an instrument shall not be recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved. The beneficial conversion features of future borrowings under the Lines of Credit will be measured using the intrinsic value calculated at the date the contingency is resolved using the conversion price and trading value of the Company's Common Stock at the date the Lines of Credit were issued (commitment date). Pursuant to borrowings made during the 2015 year, the Company recognized approximately $146,000 in beneficial conversion feature as debt discount. As a result of the retirement of all amounts outstanding under the Lines of Credit in 2015, the Company recognized all remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $385,000 as a component of interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2015. As a result of $2,650,000 in borrowings under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $219,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of additional borrowings of $3,350,000 under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded approximately $302,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accreted approximately $198,000 and $97,000, respectively, of debt discount as a component of interest expense.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's activity under its Lines of Credit for the periods indicated:\n\nWe currently do not anticipate generating sufficient revenue and profit to repay these borrowings in full when due. Therefore, unless the holders of the Lines of Credit convert any outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock, we will need to seek an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit on or before December 31, 2018. If we are unable to extend the maturity date of the Lines of Credit, we will be required to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. No assurances can be given that any such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. At this time, we do not have any commitments for alternative financing or for an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit.\nGoing Concern and Management's Plan\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $415,000, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2016. Our principal sources of liquidity at December 31, 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $7,317,000, compared to available borrowings under our Lines of Credit of $3,350,000, and approximately $1,586,000 of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nConsidering our projected cash requirements, and assuming we are unable to generate incremental revenue, our available cash may be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address our working capital requirements, management may seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities or may seek strategic or other transactions intended to increase shareholder value. There are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company's ability to continue to raise capital and generate positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8,703,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $7,911,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7,183,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $10,069,000 and an increase in operating cash from changes in assets and liabilities of $195,000. We also incurred $1,171,000 in", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td>\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including (without limitation) the disclosures made under the captions Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Risk Factors,\u201d and in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a pioneer and leader in the emerging market for biometrically enabled software-based identity management solutions.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company's financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.\nSignificant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory carrying values, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, accounting for loss contingencies, recoverability of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and amortization periods, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share based payments, assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value differential of the Preferred Stock Exchange, revenue and cost of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations.\nThe following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our consolidated results of operations. We recognize revenue from the following major revenue sources:\n\u25cf\nLong-term fixed-price contracts involving significant customization;\n\u25cf\nFixed-price contracts involving minimal customization;\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing;\n\u25cf\nSales of computer hardware and identification media; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d).\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are consistent with GAAP including Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition,\u201d ASC 605-35 Revenue Recognition, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 104,\u201d and ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Element Arrangements.\u201d Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long-term, fixed-price contracts involving significant amounts of hardware and software customization using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs upon completion. The primary components of costs incurred are third party software and direct labor cost including fringe benefits. Revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets under Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current liabilities under Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\u201d Revenue from contracts for which the Company cannot reliably estimate total costs, or there are not significant amounts of customization, are recognized upon completion. For contracts that require significant amounts of customization that the Company accounts for under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, the Company defers revenue recognition until customer acceptance is received. For contracts containing either extended or dependent payment terms, revenue recognition is deferred until such time as payment has been received by the Company. The Company also generates non-recurring revenue from the licensing of its software. Software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement, upon deliverance, when fees are fixed and determinable, when collectability is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled. The Company also generates revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer. The Company's revenue from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain and collectability of the related receivable is probable. Amounts collected in advance for maintenance services are included in current liabilities under Deferred revenues.\u201d Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers' inability to pay. We determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and the age of the accounts receivable balances and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nValuation of Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company accounts for its intangible assets under the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with a definite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360-10-05 and intangible assets with an indefinite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360. In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill, or the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is tested for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (referred to as a component) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at the component level. The Company's reporting unit is at the entity level. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company uses fair value methodologies to establish fair values.\nWe assess impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u25cf\nSignificant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results;\n\u25cf\nSignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business; and\n\u25cf\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe Company annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a need, tests the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. A two-step impairment test is used to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The first step was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value, employing the market approach, of the Company's reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The Company determined that its only reporting unit is Identity Management. Based on the results of this impairment test, the Company determined that its goodwill assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company's management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company's products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nThere are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results. Significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenues and operating expenses. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2017, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in general and administrative, sales and marketing, engineering and customer service expenses based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company's Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company's Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 ranged from 58% to 103%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved simplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. The expected term used by the Company to value the grants issued in 2017, 2016 and 2015 as computed by this method was 5.17 years. The effect of the difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company's Black-Scholes calculations were 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company's common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 6.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nASC 740-10 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our analysis of income tax reserves reflects the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, if any, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining the Company's provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation's ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company's use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent ownership changes,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, in 1991, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2011 and 2012, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets to zero relating to its federal and state research credits because of such limitations. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nFair-Value Measurements. The Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\n Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). \nAssessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Determining whether a fair value measurement is based on Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 inputs is important because certain disclosures are applicable only to those fair value measurements that use Level 3 inputs. The use of Level 3 inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions.\nFor a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nComparison of Results for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nProduct Revenue\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\nNet Product Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $1,248\n</td> <td> $391\n</td> <td> 46%\n</td> <td> $857\n</td> <td> $(744)\n</td> <td> (46)%\n</td> <td> $1,601\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $94\n</td> <td> $26\n</td> <td> 38%\n</td> <td> $68\n</td> <td> $34\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td> $34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $272\n</td> <td> $(52)\n</td> <td> (16)%\n</td> <td> $324\n</td> <td> $(233)\n</td> <td> (42)%\n</td> <td> $557\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net product revenue\n</td> <td> $1,614\n</td> <td> $365\n</td> <td> 29%\n</td> <td> $1,249\n</td> <td> $(943)\n</td> <td> (43)%\n</td> <td> $2,192\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware and royalty revenue increased 46% or approximately $391,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase is due to higher project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $397,000, higher sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $5,000, higher law enforcement project revenue of approximately $8,000 offset by lower royalty revenue of approximately $19,000.\nSoftware and royalty revenue decreased 46% or approximately $744,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due to lower project related sales of our identity management software of approximately $542,000, lower sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $93,000, lower royalty revenue of approximately $84,000 and lower law enforcement project revenue of approximately $25,000.\nRevenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 38% or approximately $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nDuring the 2016 period, revenue from the sale of hardware and consumables increased 100% or approximately $34,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions.\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Such revenue decreased 16% or approximately $52,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to the completion of the service element in identity management project solutions in the 2015 period.\nServices revenue decreased 42% or approximately $233,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to the completion of the service elements in certain identity management project solutions.\nWe believe that the period-to-period fluctuations of identity management software revenue in project-oriented solutions are largely due to the timing of government procurement with respect to the various programs we are pursuing. Although no assurances can be given, based on management's current visibility into the timing of potential government procurements and potential partnerships and current pilot programs, we believe that we will see an increase in government procurement and implementations with respect to identity management initiatives during 2018; however, government procurement initiatives, implementations and pilots are frequently delayed and extended, as was the case in the year ended December 31, 2017, and we cannot predict the timing of such initiatives.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued our efforts to move the Biometric Engine into cloud and mobile markets and to expand our end-user market into non-government sectors including commercial, consumer and healthcare applications. Our approach to the markets we serve is to partner with larger integrators as resellers who have both the infrastructure and resources to sell into the worldwide market. We rely upon these partners for guidance as to when they expect revenues for our products to begin to ramp. For those opportunities that are approaching implementation, we are being told by our partners that we should expect revenues to commence in the first quarter of 2018.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\nNet Maintenance Revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaintenance Revenue\n</td> <td> $2,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> <td> $2,563\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td> $2,577\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance revenue was approximately $2,679,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $2,563,000 and $2,577,000 for the corresponding periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,311,000 as compared to $1,181,000 for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in identity management maintenance revenue of approximately $130,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,368,000 for the twelve months ended December 2017 as compared to $1,382,000 for the comparable period in 2016. This decrease of approximately $14,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, maintenance revenue decreased approximately $14,000 as compared to the comparable period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,181,000 as compared to $1,114,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in identity management revenue of approximately $67,000 reflects the expansion of our installed base. Law enforcement maintenance revenue was approximately $1,382,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,463,000 for the comparable period in 2015. This decrease of approximately $81,000 is primarily due to the expiration of certain law enforcement maintenance contracts.\nWe anticipate growth of our maintenance revenue through the retention of existing customers combined with the continued expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of project-oriented work, however we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth.\nCost of Product Revenue\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\nCost of Product\nRevenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $39\n</td> <td> $(39)\n</td> <td> (50)%\n</td> <td> $78\n</td> <td> $(11)\n</td> <td> (12)%\n</td> <td> $89\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $64\n</td> <td> $21\n</td> <td> 49%\n</td> <td> $43\n</td> <td> $(2)\n</td> <td> (4)%\n</td> <td> $45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $49\n</td> <td> $(73)\n</td> <td> (60)%\n</td> <td> $122\n</td> <td> $(861)\n</td> <td> (88)%\n</td> <td> $983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of services product revenue\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of product revenue\n</td> <td> $152\n</td> <td> $(91)\n</td> <td> (37)%\n</td> <td> $243\n</td> <td> $(874)\n</td> <td> (78)%\n</td> <td> $1,117\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total product revenue\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of software and royalty product revenue decreased approximately $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The cost of software and royalty revenue decreased approximately $11,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is due primarily to decreases in third party software costs despite higher sales of software. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nThe cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $21,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $26,000. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales decreased by approximately $2,000, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 despite higher hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $34,000 primarily due to the 2015 period containing approximately $21,000 in hardware equipment written off due to substantial doubt as to recoverability.\nCost of services revenue decreased approximately $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease reflects lower professional service revenue of approximately $52,000. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of services revenue decreased 88% or approximately $861,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease reflects higher professional service revenue of approximately $322,000 due to the positive impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with higher level and more costly service resources utilized in the generation of such non-recurring revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Also contributing to this decrease was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period. Costs of service revenue can vary depending upon the complexity of the project solution and the mix of labor resources utilized to complete the service element.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\nMaintenance cost\nof revenue\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total maintenance cost of revenue\n</td> <td> $839\n</td> <td> $12\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td> $827\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td> $827\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n</td> <td> 31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of maintenance revenue increased approximately $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting principally from higher labor costs driven primarily by the utilization of more expensive labor resources required to fulfill maintenance contract obligations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nProduct Gross Profit\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\nProduct gross profit\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software and royalties\n</td> <td> $1,209\n</td> <td> $430\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> $779\n</td> <td> $(733)\n</td> <td> (48)%\n</td> <td> $1,512\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n</td> <td> 97%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware and consumables\n</td> <td> $30\n</td> <td> $5\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td> $25\n</td> <td> $36\n</td> <td> 327%\n</td> <td> $(11)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> $223\n</td> <td> $21\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> <td> $202\n</td> <td> $628\n</td> <td> 147%\n</td> <td> $(426)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of services product revenue\n</td> <td> 82%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product gross profit\n</td> <td> $1,462\n</td> <td> $456\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> <td> $1,006\n</td> <td> $(69)\n</td> <td> (6)%\n</td> <td> $1,075\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total product revenue\n</td> <td> 91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware and royalty gross profit increased 55% or approximately $430,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due primarily to higher software and royalty product revenue of approximately $391,000 combined with lower cost of software and royalty revenue of approximately $39,000. This relationship is reflective of approximately $339,000 in license revenue with extremely low costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nSoftware and royalty gross profit decreased 48% or approximately $733,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due primarily to lower software and royalty product revenue of approximately $744,000. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. This increase resulted from higher sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $26,000 combined with corresponding higher cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $36,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the 2015 period. This increase resulted from lower sales of hardware and consumables in project solutions of approximately $34,000 combined with corresponding lower cost of hardware and consumables product revenue of $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nServices gross profit increased approximately $21,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, due to lower service revenue of approximately $52,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $73,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This inverse relationship is cause by the recognition of certain service revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 combined with the related costs of these revenues being written off in 2015 due to significant doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nServices gross profit increased 147% or approximately $628,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to lower service revenue of approximately $233,000 combined with lower cost of service revenue of approximately $861,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in service revenue and uncharacteristically high cost of service revenue in the 2015 period reflect the impact of non-recurring revenue received from one customer in the 2015 period combined with significant costs incurred from implementation challenges. The Company's contract with this one customer in the 2015 period also included software product revenue of approximately $440,000, offset by minimal costs. Also contributing to the services gross profit increase was the write-off of $261,000 in capitalized labor costs due to doubts as to the recoverability of such costs in the 2015 period.\nMaintenance Gross Profit\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\nMaintenance gross profit\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total maintenance gross profit\n</td> <td> $ 1,840\n</td> <td> $104\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td> $1,736\n</td> <td> $(14)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> <td> $1,750\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margins related to maintenance revenue were 69% and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Gross margins related to maintenance revenue were 68% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The decrease of approximately $14,000 for the 2016 year as compared to the corresponding 2015 period primarily resulted from lower maintenance revenue of approximately $14,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.\nOperating Expense\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\nOperating Expense\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n$\nChange\n</td> <td>\n%\nChange\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> $4,192\n</td> <td> $470\n</td> <td> 13%\n</td> <td> $3,722\n</td> <td> $285\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td> $3,437\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net revenue\n</td> <td> 98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> $2,816\n</td> <td> $(205)\n</td> <td> (7)%\n</td> <td> $3,021\n</td> <td> $230\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td> $2,791\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net revenue\n</td> <td> 66%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> $5,953\n</td> <td> $621\n</td> <td> 12%\n</td> <td> $5,332\n</td> <td> $689\n</td> <td> 15%\n</td> <td> $4,643\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net revenue\n</td> <td> 139%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> $68\n</td> <td> $(61)\n</td> <td> (47)%\n</td> <td> $129\n</td> <td> $(35)\n</td> <td> (22)%\n</td> <td> $164\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of total net revenue\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense is comprised primarily of salaries and other employee-related costs for executive, financial, and other infrastructure personnel.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $35,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The relatively small amount of depreciation and amortization in both periods reflects the relatively small property and equipment carrying value.\nInterest Expense (Income), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized interest income of $43,000 and interest expense of $634,000. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized interest income of $3,000 and interest expense of $248,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized interest income of $7,000 and interest expense of $454,000.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $11,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $198,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $425,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $48,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $97,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $102,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains the following components:\n\u25cf\nApproximately $53,000 of amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the Lines of Credit;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $385,000 of amortization expense of recognized beneficial conversion feature related to the Lines of Credit borrowings;\n\u25cf\nApproximately $12,000 related to coupon interest on our 8% Line of Credit borrowings; and\n\u25cf\nApproximately $4,000 related to miscellaneous interest charges.\nOther Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized other income of approximately $125,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 is comprised of approximately $75,000 from the write off of certain accrued expenses due the expiration of the legal statute of limitations on such liabilities. Other income also includes $50,000 from the sale of one of the Company's non-utilized trademarks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income of approximately $201,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 is comprised of approximately $201,000 from the write off of certain accrued expenses due the expiration of the legal statute of limitations on such liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized other income of approximately $145,000 and other expense of $0. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 is comprised of approximately $46,000 relating to the litigation settlement of certain patent infringement matters in favor of the Company and approximately $99,000 from the recovery of a previously written-off accounts receivable.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net benefit of approximately $124,000 from income taxes, as compared to an expense of $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and expense of $22,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our benefit for income taxes of $124,000 and tax expense of $21,000, respectively. The tax benefit reflects the reversal of a prior year accrual related to foreign taxes which expired due to the expiration of the statute of limitation on this foreign tax liability. The 2016 tax expense relates to taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by research and development tax credits generated in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have incurred consolidated pre-tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and have incurred operating losses in all prior periods. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit from such losses will not be realized. Accordingly, we did not record a benefit for income taxes for these periods.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt, including our Lines of Credit (defined below). Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of SaaS capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We expect that, as our revenues grow, our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve and sustain income from operations.\nReliance on Lines of Credit\nIn March 2013, the Company and Neal Goldman, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Goldman\u201d), entered into a line of credit (the Goldman Line of Credit\u201d), as amended, with available borrowings of up to $5.5 million, and a maturity date, as amended, of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman has the right to convert the outstanding principal amount due under the terms of the Goldman Line of Credit, plus any accrued but unpaid interest due thereunder, into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs consideration for the Goldman Line of Credit, as amended, Goldman was granted warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,230,410 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the Line of Credit Warrants\u201d). The Goldman Line of Credit Warrants have exercise prices ranging between $0.95 and $2.25 per share and 177,778 of these warrants expired unexercised.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: term of two years, a risk-free interest rate of 2.58%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility between 74% and 79%. The Company recorded the fair value of the Line of Credit Warrants as a deferred financing fee of approximately $580,000 to be amortized over the life of the Goldman Line of Credit.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded an aggregate of approximately $11,000 and $48,000, respectively in deferred financing fee amortization expense which is recorded as a component of interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company has also entered into an unsecured line of credit with Charles Crocker, a member of the Company's Board of Directors ( Crocker\u201d), which, as amended, provides for available borrowings of up to $500,000 (the Crocker LOC\u201d). All amounts due under the terms of the Crocker LOC, as amended, are convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock for $1.25 per share.\nAs the amendments to the Goldman Line of Credit and the Crocker LOC (\"Lines of Credit\") resulted in an increase to the borrowing capacity of the Lines of Credit, the Company adjusted the amortization period of any remaining unamortized deferred costs and note discounts to the term of the new arrangement.\nThe Company evaluated the Lines of Credit and determined that the instruments contain a contingent beneficial conversion feature, i.e. an embedded conversion right that enables the holder to obtain the underlying Common Stock at a price below market value. The beneficial conversion feature is contingent as the terms of the conversion do not permit the Company to compute the number of shares that the holder would receive if the contingent event occurs (i.e. future borrowings under the Lines of Credit). The Company has considered the accounting for this contingent beneficial conversion feature using the guidance in ASC 470, Debt. The guidance in ASC 470 states that a contingent beneficial conversion feature in an instrument shall not be recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved. The beneficial conversion features of future borrowings under the Lines of Credit will be measured using the intrinsic value calculated at the date the contingency is resolved using the conversion price and trading value of the Company's Common Stock at the date the Lines of Credit were issued (commitment date). Pursuant to borrowings made during the 2015 year, the Company recognized approximately $146,000 in beneficial conversion feature as debt discount. As a result of the retirement of all amounts outstanding under the Lines of Credit in 2015, the Company recognized all remaining unamortized debt discount of approximately $385,000 as a component of interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2015. As a result of $2,650,000 in borrowings under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $219,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of additional borrowings of $3,350,000 under the Lines of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded approximately $302,000 in debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accreted approximately $198,000 and $97,000, respectively, of debt discount as a component of interest expense.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's activity under its Lines of Credit for the periods indicated:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> Balance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowing under Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> 2,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $2,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> 3,350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayments\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance outstanding under Lines of Credit as of December 31,\n</td> <td> $6,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently do not anticipate generating sufficient revenue and profit to repay these borrowings in full when due. Therefore, unless the holders of the Lines of Credit convert any outstanding balance into shares of Common Stock, we will need to seek an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit on or before December 31, 2018. If we are unable to extend the maturity date of the Lines of Credit, we will be required to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing to continue operations. No assurances can be given that any such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. At this time, we do not have any commitments for alternative financing or for an extension of the maturity date of the Lines of Credit.\nGoing Concern and Management's Plan\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $415,000, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2016. Our principal sources of liquidity at December 31, 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $7,317,000, compared to available borrowings under our Lines of Credit of $3,350,000, and approximately $1,586,000 of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nConsidering our projected cash requirements, and assuming we are unable to generate incremental revenue, our available cash may be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To address our working capital requirements, management may seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities or may seek strategic or other transactions intended to increase shareholder value. There are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company's ability to continue to raise capital and generate positive cash flows from operations. However, the Company operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8,703,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $7,911,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7,183,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $10,069,000 and an increase in operating cash from changes in assets and liabilities of $195,000. We also incurred $1,171,000 in"}
