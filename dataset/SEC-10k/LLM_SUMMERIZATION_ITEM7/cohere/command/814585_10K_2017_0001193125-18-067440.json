Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of MBIA Inc. should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. In addition, this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes statements of the opinion of MBIA Inc.'s management which may be forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. Refer to \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties.\nINTRODUCTION\nMBIA Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, \u201cMBIA\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) operates within the financial guarantee insurance industry. MBIA manages its business within three operating segments: 1) United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation (\u201cNational\u201d), our corporate segment is operated through MBIA Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, including our service company, MBIA Services Corporation (\u201cMBIA Services\u201d) and our international and structured finance insurance business is primarily operated through MBIA Insurance Corporation and its subsidiaries (\u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d). Effective on January 10, 2017, MBIA Corp.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA UK (Holdings) Limited (\u201cMBIA UK Holdings\u201d), sold its operating subsidiary, MBIA UK Insurance Limited (\u201cMBIA UK\u201d), to Assured Guaranty Corp. (\u201cAssured\u201d), a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. References to MBIA Inc. generally refer to activities within our corporate segment and, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d are (i) for any references relating to the period ended January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, MBIA UK, and MBIA Mexico S.A. de C.V (\u201cMBIA Mexico\u201d) and (ii) for any references relating to the period after January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation together with MBIA Mexico.\nNational's primary objective is to maximize the economics of our existing insured portfolio, including our insured exposure with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (\u201cPuerto Rico\u201d), through effective surveillance and remediation and to manage its investment portfolio. Our corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA's operating subsidiaries and asset and capital management. MBIA Corp.'s primary objectives are to satisfy claims for its policyholders, maximize future recoveries, if any, for its senior lending and other surplus note holders and, then its preferred stock holders. MBIA Corp. is executing this strategy by pursuing various actions focused on maximizing the collection of recoveries and reducing and mitigating potential losses on its insurance exposures. We do not expect National and MBIA Corp. to write new business.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2017 Events\nThe following is a summary of notable 2017 events:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In July of 2017, Puerto Rico defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds. National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $242 million during 2017. On January 1, 2018, Puerto Rico also defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $69 million. As of December 31, 2017, National had $3.4 billion of gross insured par outstanding ($3.9 billion of gross insured par outstanding when including accreted interest on insured capital appreciation bonds (\u201cCABs\u201d)) related to Puerto Rico. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW (continued)\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In the second quarter of 2017, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (\u201cS&P\u201d) downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. We believe that National's ability to write new business and to compete with other financial guarantors was largely dependent on the financial strength ratings assigned to National by major rating agencies, and with the A rating assigned by S&P, it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors. Therefore, at that time, we ceased our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. National immediately initiated cost savings measures related to the cessation of new business, which included reducing our headcount by approximately 25%. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $8 million of costs associated with the headcount reduction. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance\u201d section for additional information on the U.S. public finance insurance business and the below discussion \u201cFinancial Strength Ratings\u201d for additional information about our ratings. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. The full valuation allowance resulted from our conclusion that, at this time, we do not have sufficient positive evidence required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to support our ability to use our net deferred tax asset before it expires. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. Notwithstanding the establishment of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset, the Company believes that it may be able to derive some economic benefit over time from its net deferred tax asset before the expirations associated with that asset based upon expected earnings at National and potential future sources of taxable income to be identified by the Company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>In the first quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of MBIA UK and executed a secured financing facility which enabled MBIA Corp. to satisfy a claim of $770 million on an insurance policy insuring certain notes issued by Zohar II 2005-1, Limited (\u201cZohar II\u201d).

Also in 2017, National provided notice to Kroll Bond Rating Agency (\u201cKroll\u201d) terminating the agreement by which Kroll agreed to provide a financial strength rating to National. In December of 2017, S&P affirmed National's A with a stable outlook rating and subsequently withdrew all of its ratings and Kroll downgraded National's rating from AA+ to AA with a negative outlook and subsequently withdrew its rating. In January of 2018, Moody's downgraded National's rating to Baa2 from A3 with a stable outlook, affirmed MBIA Corp.'s rating at Caa1 with a developing outlook, downgraded MBIA Inc.'s rating to Ba3 with a stable outlook from Ba1 with a negative outlook, and affirmed MBIA Mexico's Caa1/B3.mx with a developing outlook rating. Moody's, at its discretion and in the absence of a contract with the Company, continues to maintain ratings on MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nEconomic and Financial Market Trends\nThe U.S. economy continued to improve during the fourth quarter of 2017. The labor market remains strong and economic activity has been increasing steadily. In addition, U.S. home prices across the country have maintained a positive trajectory over the year and there has been an increase in business investment. Gross domestic product increased during the quarter, driven by consumer spending and business investment and unplanned spending due to the effects of the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) increased its target for the federal funds rate in December of 2017 by 25 basis points citing the economic factors of a strong labor market and solid economic growth along with low inflation. There is an expectation of three rate increases in 2018. The FOMC stated that it will continue to monitor economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation as they work to a path towards a relatively gradual normalization of rates. Congress successfully passed comprehensive tax reform in December of 2017 which includes a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. Tax reform, along with Congress' emphasis on a reduction in regulation, is expected to lead to continued economic growth.\nEconomic and financial market trends could impact MBIA's business outlook and its financial results. Many states and municipalities have experienced growing tax collections that resulted from increased economic activity and higher assessed property valuations. The economic improvement at the state and local level strengthens the credit quality of the issuers of our insured municipal bonds, improves the performance of our insured U.S. public finance portfolio and could reduce the amount of National's potential incurred losses. In addition, higher projected interest rates could yield increased returns on our Company's investment portfolio. A decrease in oil prices could have a positive impact on certain sales taxes to the extent consumer spending increases as a result. However, some states and municipalities will experience a decrease in revenues where their economies are reliant on the oil and gas industries.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. The following accounting estimates are viewed by management to be critical because they require significant judgment on the part of management. Management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. Financial results could be materially different if other methodologies were used or if management modified its assumptions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense (\u201cLAE\u201d) reserves are established by loss reserve committees in each of our major operating insurance companies (National and MBIA Insurance Corporation) and reviewed by our executive Loss Reserve Committee, which consists of members of senior management. Loss and LAE reserves include case basis reserves and accruals for LAE incurred with respect to non-derivative financial guarantees. Case basis reserves represent our estimate of expected losses to be paid under insurance contracts, net of expected recoveries, on insured obligations that have defaulted or are expected to default. These reserves require the use of judgment and estimates with respect to the occurrence, timing and amount of paid losses and recoveries on insured obligations. Given that the reserves are based on such estimates and assumptions, there can be no assurance that the actual ultimate losses will not be greater than or less than such estimates, resulting in the Company recognizing additional or reversing excess loss and LAE reserves through earnings.\nWe take into account a number of variables in establishing specific case basis reserves for individual policies that depend primarily on the nature of the underlying insured obligation. These variables include the nature and creditworthiness of the issuers of the insured obligations, expected recovery rates on unsecured obligations, the projected cash flow or market value of any assets pledged as collateral on secured obligations, and the expected rates of recovery, cash flow or market values on such obligations or assets. Factors that may affect the actual ultimate realized losses for any policy include economic conditions and trends, political developments, the extent to which sellers/servicers comply with the representations or warranties made in connection therewith, levels of interest rates, rates of inflation, borrower behavior, the default rate and salvage values of specific collateral, and our ability to enforce contractual rights through litigation and otherwise. Our remediation strategy for an insured obligation that has defaulted or is expected to default may also have an impact on our loss reserves.\nIn establishing case basis loss reserves, we calculate the present value of probability-weighted estimated loss payments, net of estimated recoveries, using a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate applicable to the currency and the weighted average remaining life of the insurance contract. Yields on U.S. Treasury offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in U.S. dollars, which represent the majority of our loss reserves. Similarly, yields on foreign government offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a comprehensive discussion of our loss reserves and recoveries, including critical accounting estimates used in the determination of these amounts.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into the three-level hierarchy according to accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures based on the significance of pricing inputs to the measurement in its entirety. Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in markets that are not active where significant inputs are observable are generally categorized as Level 2, and fair value measurements of financial instruments where significant inputs are not observable are generally categorized as Level 3. We categorize our financial instruments based on the lowest level category at which we can generate reliable fair values. The determination of reliability requires management to exercise judgment. The degree of judgment used to determine the fair values of financial instruments generally correlates to the degree that pricing is not observable.\nThe fair value measurements of financial instruments held or issued by the Company are determined through the use of observable market data when available. Market data is obtained from a variety of third-party sources, including dealer quotes. If dealer quotes are not available for an instrument that is infrequently traded, we use alternate valuation methods, including either dealer quotes for similar contracts or modeling using market data inputs. The use of alternate valuation methods generally requires considerable judgment in the application of estimates and assumptions and changes to these variables may produce materially different values.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nThe fair value pricing of assets and liabilities is a function of many components which include interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. For financial instruments that are internally valued by the Company, as well as those for which the Company uses broker quotes or pricing services, credit risk is typically incorporated by using appropriate credit spreads or discount rates as inputs. Substantially all of the Company's investments carried and reported at fair value are priced by independent third parties, including pricing services and brokers.\nInstruments that trade infrequently and, therefore, have little or no price transparency are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Also included in Level 3 are financial instruments that have significant unobservable inputs deemed significant to the instrument's overall fair value. Level 3 assets represented approximately 30% and 21% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represented approximately 41% and 37% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRefer to \u201cNote 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value, including valuation techniques and significant inputs.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recorded with respect to the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements that will result in deductible or taxable amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Our temporary differences relate principally to net operating losses, premium revenue recognition, accrued interest on outstanding surplus notes, insured loss reserves, unrealized gains or losses on investments and insured derivatives and deferred acquisition costs.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets. Changes in the amount of a valuation allowance are reflected within our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. Determining whether to establish a valuation allowance and, if so, the amount of the valuation allowance requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such tax benefits will be realized in future periods prior to the expiration of the deferred tax assets.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future federal pre-tax income. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses. Actual future taxable income or loss could be significantly different from our projections. In evaluating the objective evidence that recent results provide, we consider the prior three years of cumulative pre-tax comprehensive income (loss). We consider a trend of comprehensive income to be positive evidence of our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset and a trend of comprehensive losses to be negative evidence.\nDuring 2017, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. The Company will continue to analyze the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to \u201cNote 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of Consolidated Results\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions except for per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>564 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(661) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(339) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,605) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.50) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.54) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.50) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.54) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average number of common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,930,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,001,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,936,318 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,930,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,001,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,869,788 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> 2017 vs. 2016\nThe increase in consolidated total revenues was primarily due to an impairment loss related to the sale of MBIA UK recorded in 2016, gains related to changes in the fair values of assets of consolidated variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and warrants on MBIA Inc. stock and a realized gain related to the settlement of litigation, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on Euro denominated liabilities due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, an increase in net investment losses related to other-than-temporary impairments (\u201cOTTI\u201d) and lower net premiums earned due to higher refunding activity in 2016. The increase in OTTI related to several impaired securities for which a loss was recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $683 million and $220 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured first-lien residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d).\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes increased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe decrease in consolidated total revenues was primarily due to an impairment loss related to the sale of MBIA UK, a decrease in net gains on insured derivatives and lower net premiums earned due to higher refunding activity in 2015. Net losses on insured derivatives in 2016 were primarily the result of claim payments on commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) transactions. Net gains on insured derivatives in 2015 were principally the result of changes in transaction-specific factors, such as credit ratings, partially offset by claim payments.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $220 million and $123 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured second-lien RMBS transactions, partially offset by decreases in insured collateralized debt obligation (\u201cCDO\u201d) losses.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nIn addition to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also analyze the operating performance of the Company using adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, both non-GAAP measures. Previously, these non-GAAP measures were referred to as combined operating income (loss) and combined operating income (loss) per diluted common share. There was no change to the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. There was only a change to the names of these non-GAAP measures. Since adjusted net income (loss) is used by management to assess performance and make business decisions, we consider adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share fundamental measures of periodic financial performance which are useful in understanding our results. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are not substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted common share determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definitions of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share include the after-tax results of the Company and remove the after-tax results of our international and structured finance insurance segment, which is not part of our ongoing business strategy, as well as the following:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Elimination of the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments that primarily include interest rate swaps and hybrid financial instruments.

We consider ABV a measure of fundamental value of the Company and the change in ABV an important measure of financial performance. ABV adjusts GAAP book value to remove the legal entity book value of MBIA Corp. In addition, ABV adjusts for certain items which the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value through GAAP earnings and other comprehensive income, as well as add in the impact of certain items which the Company believes will be realized in GAAP book value in future periods. The Company has limited such adjustments to those items that it deems to be important to fundamental value and performance and for which the likelihood and amount can be reasonably estimated. We have presented ABV to allow investors and analysts to evaluate the Company using the same measure that MBIA's management regularly uses to measure financial performance and value. ABV is not a substitute for and should not be viewed in isolation of GAAP book value, and our definition of ABV may differ from that used by other companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ABV per share was $29.32, a decrease from $31.88 as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in ABV per share was primarily driven by the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax asset and losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures, partially offset by a decrease in common shares outstanding from the share repurchases made by the Company during 2017. The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated book value per share to consolidated ABV per share:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions except share and per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shareholders' equity of MBIA Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,484,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,200,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reverse book value of the MBIA Corp. legal entity(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value after MBIA Corp. legal entity adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other book value adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reverse net unrealized (gains) losses included in other comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add net unearned premium revenue(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add tax effect on unrealized (gains) losses and unearned premium revenue(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.61) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other book value adjustments per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted book value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-The book value of the MBIA Corp. legal entity does not provide significant economic or shareholder value to MBIA Inc.\n(2)-Consists of financial guarantee premiums, net of deferred acquisition costs.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nU.S. Public Finance Insurance\nOur U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National. The financial guarantees issued by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due or, in the event National has exercised, at its discretion, the right to accelerate the payment under its policies upon the acceleration of the underlying insured obligations due to default or otherwise. National's guarantees insure municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions, as well as utility districts, airports, healthcare institutions, higher educational facilities, student loan issuers, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, user fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. As of December 31, 2017, National had total insured gross par outstanding of $71.9 billion.\nOn June 26, 2017, S&P downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. S&P noted that the downgrade of National was based on its view that National had not gained wide market acceptance as demonstrated by its low new business volume. We determined that with the A rating it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors, and therefore, we ceased at that time our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. Subsequent to the S&P financial strength rating downgrade, National terminated its agreement for ratings from S&P, Moody's and Kroll.\nNational continues to surveil and remediate its existing insured portfolio and will seek opportunities to enhance shareholder value using its strong financial resources, while protecting the interests of its policyholders. Certain state and local governments and territory obligors that National insures remain under financial and budgetary stress. This could lead to an increase in defaults by such entities on the payment of their obligations and losses or impairments on a greater number of the Company's insured transactions. In particular, Puerto Rico is experiencing significant fiscal stress and constrained liquidity due to, among other things, Puerto Rico's structural budget imbalance, the lack of access to the capital markets, a stagnating local economy, net migration of people out of Puerto Rico and a high debt burden. Although Puerto Rico has tried to address its challenges through various fiscal policies, it continues to experience significant fiscal stress. Also, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane resulting in catastrophic damage to much of the island's basic infrastructure, including its electrical transmission and distribution grid, telecommunications network, housing, roads, bridges, water and sewer systems. On September 21, 2017, the President of the United States approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) made federal disaster assistance available to Puerto Rico to supplement its recovery efforts. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. We continue to monitor and analyze these situations and other stressed credits closely, and the overall extent and duration of this stress is uncertain.\nItem 7.

premium earnings and premium earnings from refunded issues. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2017 compared with 2016 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $41 million and scheduled premiums earned of $21 million. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2016 compared with 2015 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $42 million and scheduled premiums earned of $26 million. Scheduled premium earnings declined due to the refunding and maturity of insured issues in prior periods. Refunding activity over the past several years has accelerated premium earnings in prior periods and reduced the amount of scheduled premiums that would have been earned in the current period.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange primarily relate to net realized gains from the sales of securities as a result of favorable market conditions. In 2016, the increase in these net realized gains was primarily due to generating liquidity for anticipated claim payments on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nNET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS Net investment losses related to OTTI for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to impaired securities for which losses were recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value or recovery value. This OTTI resulted from liquidity concerns, recent credit rating downgrades and other adverse financial conditions of the issuers.\nLOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES National's insured portfolio management group within our U.S. public finance insurance segment is responsible for monitoring our U.S. public finance insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and performance of the insured issue.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's loss reserving policy and additional information related to its loss reserves.\nItem 7.

Gross expenses increased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to severance related expenses associated with the headcount reduction.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 and 2015 due to higher refunding activity in prior years. When an insured obligation refunds, we accelerate any remaining deferred acquisition costs associated with the policy covering the refunded insured obligation. We did not defer a material amount of policy acquisition costs during 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nINSURED PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE Financial guarantee insurance companies use a variety of approaches to assess the underlying credit risk profile of their insured portfolios. National uses both an internally developed credit rating system as well as third-party rating sources in the analysis of credit quality measures of its insured portfolio. In evaluating credit risk, we obtain, when available, the underlying rating(s) of the insured obligation before the benefit of its insurance policy from nationally recognized rating agencies, Moody's and S&P. Other companies within the financial guarantee industry may report credit quality information based upon internal ratings that would not be comparable to our presentation. We maintain internal ratings on our entire portfolio, and our ratings may be higher or lower than the underlying ratings assigned by Moody's or S&P.\nThe following table presents the credit quality distribution of National's U.S. public finance outstanding gross par insured as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. CABs are reported at the par amount at the time of issuance of the insurance policy. All ratings are as of the period presented and represent S&P underlying ratings, where available. If transactions are not rated by S&P, a Moody's equivalent rating is used. If transactions are not rated by either S&P or Moody's, an internal equivalent rating is used.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Par Outstanding </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>In millions </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AAA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> A\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BBB\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Below investment grade\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 7.

On September 21, 2017, the President of the United States approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico and FEMA made federal disaster assistance available to Puerto Rico to supplement its recovery efforts. Many residents of Puerto Rico continue to lack access to basic necessities such as clean water, food and health care. The lack of passable roads and compromised infrastructure has complicated recovery efforts. Given the significant physical barriers to assistance, the Department of Defense took over much of the initial search, rescue and restoration effort. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has taken the lead in the effort to rebuild the Island's infrastructure, in cooperation with FEMA and Puerto Rico. Damage estimates vary widely, but a preliminary report from Moody's Analytics places the upper bound of the range at $95 billion. This estimate includes lost economic activity and physical damage to infrastructure. Given the numerous estimates of physical damage and the extent of insurance coverage, uninsured damages are not reasonably estimable at this time. On October 12, 2017, the House of Representatives passed legislation providing $36.5 billion in emergency disaster assistance for areas of the U.S. impacted by recent hurricanes and wildfires including California, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This amount includes $4.9 billion in community disaster loans which will be, in part, made available to Puerto Rico. Under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response, that portion of the $4.9 billion made available to Puerto Rico may be directed to activities that directly mitigate the impacts of the disaster. The measure was approved by the U.S. Senate and has been signed by the President of the United States. As of February 12, 2018, no monies have been advanced to Puerto Rico under this authorization. On February 9, 2018, the U.S. Congress approved, and the President of the United States signed into law, a new supplemental spending authorization totaling approximately $90.0 billion to cover necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and wildfires that occurred in 2017. Of this amount, Puerto Rico expects to receive approximately $16.5 billion in federal funds, including up to $4.8 billion for healthcare, $10.0 billion for housing and $2.0 billion for improvements to the island's electrical power systems. Refer to the following \u201cPREPA\u201d section below for further information about Hurricane Maria's impact to Puerto Rico.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOn June 30, 2016, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d), was signed into law by the President of the United States. PROMESA provides both for the creation of an independent oversight board (the \u201cOversight Board\u201d) with powers relating to the development and implementation of a fiscal plan for Puerto Rico as well as a court-supervised process that allows Puerto Rico to restructure its debt if voluntary agreements cannot be reached with creditors through a collective action process.\nOn March 13, 2017, the Oversight Board approved the Governor's revised long-term fiscal plan, which decreased the 10 year cumulative cash flow by $3.85 billion from $11.6 billion to $7.8 billion (pre-Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) funding and debt service). The certified plan identified fiscal cliffs from an absence of ACA, the assumed loss of Act 154 excise taxes, and pension contributions under current law and both suggested similar solutions, including tax reform, improved tax compliance, centralized procurement, headcount reductions, and the extension of the Act 154 excise tax for a period of time. As part of Act 3-2017 passed by the new administration, the Act 154 excise tax was extended until December 31, 2027. Additionally, on April 28, 2017, the Oversight Board certified four instrumentality fiscal plans, including fiscal plans for PREPA and PRHTA, subject to certain requested amendments.\nOn May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board certified and filed a petition under Title III of PROMESA for Puerto Rico with the District Court of Puerto Rico thereby commencing a bankruptcy-like case for Puerto Rico. Following the filing of this petition by the Oversight Board, National, together with Assured and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., filed an adversary complaint in the Title III case alleging that the Fiscal Plan and the Fiscal Plan Compliance Act, as discussed below, violate PROMESA and the U.S. Constitution. Under a separate petition, the Oversight Board also commenced a Title III case for COFINA on May 5, 2017. Subsequently, the Oversight Board also certified and filed voluntary petitions under Title III of PROMESA for several other municipalities, including PRHTA and PREPA on May 21, 2017 and July 2, 2017, respectively.\nPursuant to PROMESA, the Title III cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico, and the court has entered an order directing the cases to be jointly administered for procedural purposes. The Oversight Board and creditors met for the first time in court in May of 2017 in San Juan before the judge presiding over the cases to begin addressing the nearly $70 billion of debt amassed by Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. Given the unprecedented legal disputes and the complexity of the issues expected, the judge has designated five federal judges to act as mediators in all of the Title III cases and the University of Puerto Rico which, at this time, has indicated a desire to pursue a Title VI resolution. These judges will attempt to facilitate voluntary mediation discussions.\nAs a result of prior defaults, various stays and the Title III cases, National paid gross claims in the aggregate amount of $91 million, $24 million and $173 million against general obligation (\u201cGO\u201d) bonds, PBA bonds and PRHTA bonds, relating to debt service due on July 1, 2017, January 1, 2017 and July 1, 2016, respectively. In addition, National paid claims in the aggregate amount of $127 million against PREPA bonds relating to debt service due on July 1, 2017, following the expiration of the Restructuring Support Agreement (\u201cRSA\u201d), as further discussed below, on June 29, 2017.\nIn light of the impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico, and the resulting inevitable need for Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board to overhaul the Fiscal Plan, on October 6, 2017, National, Assured and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. filed a voluntary notice of dismissal, without prejudice, of their adversary complaint regarding the Fiscal Plan and Fiscal Plan Compliance Act. Also, on October 13, 2017, National, together with the other plaintiffs in the filing, voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the adversary complaint filed on August 7, 2017 which sought to compel PREPA to deposit revenues with the bond trustee as required by the terms of the PREPA Trust Agreements, PROMESA and the U.S. Constitution. At its October 31, 2017 meeting, the Oversight Board\nsought from Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities covered under PROMESA, revised fiscal plans that account for the damage suffered from Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico and PREPA submitted their updated fiscal plans to the Oversight Board on January 24, 2018. The University of Puerto Rico and PRHTA must submit their revised fiscal plans to the Oversight Board by March 9, 2018. The Oversight Board intends to certify or recommend additional changes to these revised fiscal plans during the first quarter of 2018.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOn January 24, 2018, the Puerto Rico government submitted its draft fiscal plan to the Oversight Board, which reflects the government's expected economic outlook of Puerto Rico over a five year period after integrating four additional key drivers in the projections: (i) the negative impact of Hurricane Maria, (ii) mitigating impact of disaster relief assistance, (iii) changes to revenue and expense measures, and (iv) the impact of structural reforms. After these four additional key drivers are fully implemented, the draft fiscal plan shows Puerto Rico going from a $3.7 billion surplus to a $3.4 billion deficit (before debt service) over the five year period. Following receipt of the government's draft fiscal plan, the Oversight Board determined that the proposed fiscal plan was noncompliant with the requirements of PROMESA and, therefore, required certain revisions before certification by the Oversight Board. As a result, the government submitted a revised fiscal plan for Puerto Rico on February 12, 2018 to incorporate the Oversight Board's comments and the incremental disaster relief funding provided by recent legislation approved by U.S. Congress on February 9, 2018. Notwithstanding the revisions, the draft fiscal plan remains subject to further adjustment following additional input and review by the Oversight Board.\nCOFINA\nIn October of 2016, a group of GO bondholders, which had previously initiated litigation against Puerto Rico in July of 2016, moved to amend its complaint to add a challenge to Puerto Rico's putative diversion of funds to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (\u201cCOFINA\u201d). The plaintiff group contends that the funds being used to pay bonds issued by COFINA constitute \u201cavailable resources\u201d within the meaning of article VI, section 8 of the Puerto Rico Constitution, and therefore must be devoted to payment of principal and interest on Puerto Rico's public debt before they may be used for other purposes. By failing to redirect such funds to pay GO bondholders, the plaintiff group claims that Puerto Rico is improperly diverting funds to COFINA bondholders.\nI. Bank of New York Mellon Interpleader Action\nFollowing alleged events of default, certain creditors, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (\u201cAAFAF\u201d), and the Oversight Board provided COFINA's Trustee, Bank of New York, with conflicting instructions regarding the application of funds held by the trustee. In addition, certain creditors have sued Bank of New York, for alleged breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the application of funds held by the trustee upon an event of default. As a result, Bank of New York filed an interpleader motion with the court overseeing COFINA's Title III case, seeking relief from any potential liability brought by creditors and direction from the court as to control and application of approximately $1.1 billion of funds held by the trustee as of February 1, 2018. National has intervened in this matter. Given the complexity of the issues, on May 30, 2017, the judge granted Bank of New York's interpleader request upon ordering a freeze on disbursements to all bondholders and temporarily setting aside the funds until the dispute can be resolved between the parties. On November 6, 2017, National, along with Ambac Assurance Corporation, filed a joint motion for summary judgment asserting, among other things, that (i) events of default have occurred under the COFINA Resolution requiring payment to senior bondholders before any distribution to subordinate bondholders, and (ii) the COFINA bonds have been accelerated. All summary judgment motions are fully briefed and pending.\nII. Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute\nOn August 10, 2017, the judge entered a stipulated order establishing procedures to govern resolution of certain disputes between Puerto Rico and COFINA (the \u201cCommonwealth-COFINA Dispute\u201d). In recognition of the fact that the Oversight Board acts for both Puerto Rico and COFINA, the Court appointed the official Unsecured Creditors Committee to serve as Puerto Rico's representative to litigate and/or settle the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute on behalf of Puerto Rico (the \u201cCommonwealth Agent\u201d) and Bettina M. Whyte of Bettina Whyte Consultants, LLC, to serve as the COFINA representative to litigate and/or settle the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute on behalf of COFINA (the \u201cCOFINA Agent\u201d). The Commonwealth Agent filed an adversary complaint on September 8, 2017. On September 15, 2017, the COFINA Agent filed an Answer to the Complaint and asserted eight counterclaims for declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the COFINA structure. On October 25, 2017, the Commonwealth Agent filed an amended complaint that contained minor revisions to the factual allegations concerning the directors of COFINA, permitted use of bond proceeds, and the enactment of the sales and use tax. On October 30, 2017, the COFINA Agent filed its amended answer and counterclaims.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nPursuant to the stipulated order, National was permitted to intervene in this adversary proceeding. Accordingly, on November 6, 2017, National filed a notice of intervention, an answer to the Commonwealth Agent's amended complaint, and counterclaims. In its counterclaims, National asserted four causes of action seeking, inter alia, declarations that the COFINA enabling statutes are constitutional, the sales and use tax revenues were validly transferred to COFINA, and the Commonwealth's appropriation of the sales and use tax revenues violates the takings and contracts clauses of the U.S. and Puerto Rico constitutions.\nOn November 13, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a motion to confirm the scope of the COFINA and Commonwealth Agents' authority and to determine whether certain claims exceeded the scope of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute. The Court also received additional filings relating to the scope of the agents' authority in connection with the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute.\nOn December 21, 2017, the Court issued an order limiting the scope of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute to whether the sales taxes pledged for repayment of the COFINA bonds are the property of the Commonwealth or COFINA and dismissed without prejudice any claims the Court determined to exceed that scope. On January 13, 2018, the Court granted the Commonwealth Agent leave to file a second amended complaint re-pleading two causes of action that previously had been dismissed as exceeding the scope of the Commonwealth-COFINA Dispute and seeking declarations that the COFINA enabling statutes violate the debt limit, debt priority, and balanced budget clauses of the Puerto Rico Constitution. The COFINA Agent and permitted intervenors, including\nNational, filed answers to the second amended complaint in January of 2018. Discovery is ongoing. Motions for summary judgment were due in February of 2018.\nCurrently, National has exposure to senior-lien COFINA debt of over $1.1 billion, including CAB accreted interest. As legal opinions from Puerto Rico justice secretaries and bond counsel have confirmed, National believes that the legal structure of COFINA is sound and that COFINA bondholders are the owners of the COFINA funds and maintain a valid statutory lien on the sales tax revenue stream backing the bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until all legal challenges are resolved, there can be no assurance that the COFINA structure will be upheld and the sales tax revenue lien will be recognized.\nPREPA\nNational's largest exposure to Puerto Rico, by gross par outstanding, is to PREPA. On December 23, 2015, National, Assured Guaranty, and the ad hoc group of bondholders (representing approximately $3.0 billion, or 37.0% of the power revenue bonds, (collectively the \u201cSupporting Creditors\u201d)) entered into an RSA with the support of almost 70% of $8.4 billion of outstanding PREPA bonds, including approximately $1.2 billion of PREPA bonds insured by National. The RSA was supplemented and extended several times during subsequent periods and the Supporting Creditors made three separate bond purchases to assist with PREPA's liquidity. National bought and currently owns $139 million of PREPA bonds.\nOn January 27, 2017, the newly created AAFAF announced that it would lead future negotiations on behalf of PREPA (and all Puerto Rico entities). On April 5, 2017, the Governor, AAFAF and PREPA announced their collective intention to enter into a modified RSA with the Supporting Creditors, subject to final documentation, which was completed in April of 2017; this revised RSA was effective until June 29, 2017.\nThe revised RSA and related PREPA fiscal plan were submitted to the Oversight Board and the Oversight Board certified the Fiscal Plan on April 28, 2017. Notwithstanding certification of the Fiscal Plan, the Oversight Board rejected the RSA on June 28, 2017. The RSA was then terminated by PREPA and PREPA requested certification of a Title III case. The Oversight Board commenced a Title III case for PREPA on July 2, 2017.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nPREPA sustained heavy damage to its infrastructure from the two September 2017 hurricanes and in particular from Hurricane Maria. Its generating assets, located along the coast sustained only minor damage but damage to the transmission and distribution infrastructure was extensive. Power is still out across portions of the island, particularly in the rural inland areas. Lack of power has a knock-on effect of disabling telecommunication and water systems as well. Restoration efforts are being coordinated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under contract with FEMA; monies from FEMA are expected to finance the reconstruction effort. In December of 2017 and continuing into January of 2018, mainland electric crews have arrived in force with equipment and supplies to continue the restoration effort. As of February 5, 2018, PREPA is reporting approximately 72% of its customers have had power restored.\nThe PREPA revised Fiscal Plan released January 24, 2018 calls for a wholesale transformation of PREPA to at least a partially privatized entity. Specifics regarding implementation and the impact on creditors were not detailed or readily apparent in the Plan.\nPRHTA\nOn May 21, 2017, upon the expiration of the PROMESA stay, the Oversight Board commenced a Title III case for PRHTA. On June 3, 2017, National, together with Assured and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., filed an adversary proceeding in the PRHTA's Title III case. The complaint seeks to enforce the special revenue protections of the Bankruptcy Code which are incorporated into PROMESA. These provisions ensure, among other things, that (i) current tax and toll revenues remain subject to liens and (ii) the automatic stay resulting from a filing of a Title III petition does not stay or limit application of these pledged special revenues to the repayment of PRHTA debt. Motions to dismiss were filed on June 28, 2017, and oral arguments were heard on November 21, 2017. The court took the matter under advisement, but ordered a supplemental briefing, which was submitted on November 28, 2017. On January 30, 2018, the judge granted the motions to dismiss the monolines' PRHTA-related adversary proceeding. On February 9, 2018, National, together with Assured, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. and Financial Guaranty Insurance Company filed their notice of appeal of the motions to dismiss to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\nAdditionally, on June 20, 2017, AAFAF informed Bank of New York, as fiscal agent for the PRHTA bonds, that due to the Title III case, the funds in the debt service reserve account in AAFAF's view were not property of the bondholders and that Bank of New York should not disburse these funds to bondholders on July 1, 2017. The parties agreed that such funds would be held by the Bank of New York and disbursement of such funds would be addressed in the pending adversary proceeding.\nOther\nOther than Inter American University of Puerto Rico Inc., S&P, Fitch Ratings and/or Moody's have downgraded the ratings of all Puerto Rico issuers to below investment grade with a negative outlook due to narrowing liquidity, sluggish economic growth and persistent structural deficits. Additionally, subsequent to the declaration of a state of emergency and suspension of debt service payments by the then Governor of Puerto Rico, S&P revised its rating for Puerto Rico, its GO, PREPA and PRHTA's subordinated transportation revenue bonds, series 1998, state infrastructure bank, to \u201cD\u201d (default). On June 6, 2017, S&P further downgraded COFINA from \u201cCC\u201d to \u201cD\u201d based on court motions that directed the trustee to withhold scheduled monthly payments until property interest disputes have been resolved.\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCorporate\nOur corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA Inc.'s subsidiaries as well as asset and capital management. Support services are provided by our service company, MBIA Services, and include, among others, management, legal, accounting, treasury, information technology, and insurance portfolio surveillance, on a fee-for-service basis. Capital management includes activities related to servicing obligations issued by MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries, GFL and MBIA Investment Management Corp (\u201cIMC\u201d). MBIA Inc. issued debt to finance the operations of the MBIA group. GFL raised funds through the issuance of medium-term notes (\u201cMTNs\u201d) with varying maturities, which were in turn guaranteed by MBIA Corp. GFL lent the proceeds of these MTN issuances to MBIA Inc. IMC, along with MBIA Inc., provided customized investment agreements, guaranteed by MBIA Corp., for bond proceeds and other public funds for such purposes as construction, loan origination, escrow and debt service or other reserve fund requirements. The Company has ceased issuing new MTNs and investment agreements and the outstanding liability balances and corresponding asset balances have declined over time as liabilities matured, terminated or were called or repurchased. All of the debt within the corporate segment is managed collectively and is serviced by available liquidity.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of our corporate segment for the

instruments at fair value and foreign exchange for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses on Euro denominated liabilities from the weakening of the U.S. dollar, partially offset by favorable changes in the fair value of the outstanding warrants issued on MBIA Inc. common stock, a decrease in net losses on the sales of investments and an increase in gains from our interest rate swaps. The changes in the fair value of outstanding warrants were primarily attributable to a decrease in the price of MBIA Inc.'s common stock and changes in volatility, which are used in the valuation of the warrants.\nThe unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange for 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains on Euro denominated liabilities from a decline in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and unfavorable changes in the fair value of the outstanding warrants issued on MBIA Inc. common stock.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT The increase in net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to an increase in gains from purchases, at discounts, of MTNs issued by the Company.\nOTHER NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) The decrease in other net realized gains (losses) for 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to the results from the sale of Cutwater in 2015.\nOPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to decreases in compensation expense, primarily as a result of lower headcount.\nINTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 and 2015 due to the continued maturities and repurchases of debt obligations issued by the Company.\nPROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for 2017 was driven by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. The 2016 benefit for income taxes was impacted by foreign tax credit adjustments, the fluctuation of the value of nontaxable warrants issued by the Company and nondeductible equity-based compensation expense. The 2015 provision for income taxes was impacted by nondeductible equity-based compensation expense.\nInternational and Structured Finance Insurance\nOur international and structured finance insurance portfolios are managed through MBIA Corp. The financial guarantees issued by MBIA Corp. generally provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, non-U.S. public finance and global structured finance insured obligations when due or, in the event MBIA Corp. has the right, at its discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise. Effective on January 10, 2017, MBIA Corp.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA UK Holdings, sold MBIA UK to Assured.\nMBIA Corp. has insured sovereign-related and sub-sovereign bonds, privately issued bonds used for the financing of utilities, toll roads, bridges, airports, public transportation facilities, and other types of infrastructure projects serving a substantial public purpose. Global structured finance and asset-backed obligations typically are securities repayable from cash flows generated by a specified pool of assets, such as residential and commercial mortgages, insurance policies, consumer loans, corporate loans and bonds, trade and export receivables, and leases for equipment, aircraft and real estate property. We no longer insure new credit derivative contracts except for transactions related to the restructuring or reduction of existing derivative exposure. MBIA Insurance Corporation insures the investment contracts written by MBIA Inc., and if MBIA Inc. or such subsidiaries were to have insufficient assets to pay amounts due upon maturity or termination, MBIA Insurance Corporation would be required to make such payments under its insurance policies. MBIA Insurance Corporation also insured debt obligations of other affiliates, including GFL and IMC. MBIA Corp. has also written insurance policies guaranteeing the obligations under credit default swap (\u201cCDS\u201d) contracts of an affiliate, LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC and certain other derivative contracts. Certain policies cover payments potentially due under CDS, including termination payments that may become due in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of certain insolvency or payment defaults under the CDS or derivative contracts by the insured counterparty or by the guarantor. MBIA Insurance Corporation provides reinsurance to MBIA Mexico.\nMBIA Corp. has contributed to the Company's net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward, which is used in the calculation of our consolidated income taxes. If MBIA Corp. becomes profitable, it is not expected to make any tax payments under our tax sharing agreement. Based on MBIA Corp.'s current projected earnings and our expectation that it will not write new business, we believe it is unlikely that MBIA Corp. will generate significant income in the near future. As a result, we believe MBIA Corp. does not provide significant economic value to MBIA Inc. and its shareholders.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOn January 20, 2017, MBIA Corp. was presented with and fully satisfied a claim of $770 million (the \u201cZohar II Claim\u201d) on an insurance policy it had written insuring certain notes issued by Zohar II. In order to satisfy the claim, MBIA Corp. used approximately $60 million from its own resources and executed the following two related transactions: 1) MBIA UK Holdings sold its operating subsidiary, MBIA UK, and made a cash payment of $23 million, to Assured, in exchange for the receipt by MBIA UK Holdings of certain Zohar II notes owned by Assured, which had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $347 million as of January 10, 2017, which notes were distributed as a dividend to MBIA Corp. upon completion of the sale of MBIA UK; and 2) MBIA Corp. executed a financing facility (the \u201cFacility\u201d) with affiliates of certain holders of 14% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Surplus Notes of MBIA Corp. (collectively, the \u201cSenior Lenders\u201d), and with MBIA Inc., pursuant to which the Senior Lenders provided $325 million of senior financing and MBIA Inc. provided $38 million of subordinated financing to MZ Funding LLC (\u201cMZ Funding\u201d), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which in turn lent the proceeds of such financing to MBIA Corp.

Net premiums earned decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to decreases in scheduled premiums as a result of the sale of MBIA UK on January 10, 2017 and from the maturity and early settlements of insured transactions with no writings of new insurance policies. Net premiums earned decreased for 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to decreases in scheduled premiums earned from the maturity and early settlements of insured transactions with no writings of new insurance policies.\nNET INVESTMENT INCOME The increase in net investment income for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily related to the accretion on certain Zohar II notes received in exchange for the sale of MBIA UK to Assured on January 10, 2017.\nFEES AND REIMBURSEMENTS The decrease in fees and reimbursements for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to decreases in termination and waiver and consent fees related to the ongoing management of our international and structured finance insurance business and ceding commission income as a result of lower refunding activity. The increase in fees and reimbursements for 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in termination and waiver and consent fees related to the ongoing management of our international and structured finance insurance business, partially offset by a decrease in ceding commission income as a result of lower refunding activity. Due to the transaction-specific nature inherent in fees and reimbursements, these revenues can vary significantly from period to period.\nNET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF INSURED DERIVATIVES Realized losses on insured derivatives include payments made net of premiums and fees earned and salvage received. Premiums earned related to insured credit derivatives will decrease over time as a result of settlements prior to maturity and scheduled amortizations. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, realized losses on insured derivatives primarily resulted from claim payments on CMBS exposure.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nFor 2016, unrealized gains on insured derivatives were principally the result of a decline in the weighted average life on transactions, favorable changes in spreads/prices on the underlying collateral and a reversal of unrealized losses due to commutations partially offset by the effects of MBIA's nonperformance risk on its derivative liabilities. For 2015, unrealized gains on insured derivatives were principally the result of refining the credit rating of underlying collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of MBIA Corp.'s insured CDS liability was $63 million and $64 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Corp. had $127 million of gross par outstanding on insured credit derivatives compared with $588 million as of December 31, 2016.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE The net losses on financial instruments and foreign exchange for 2017 were primarily related to unfavorable mark-to-market fluctuations on derivatives. The net gains on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange for 2016 were primarily related to gains from foreign currency revaluation of Chilean Unidad de Fomento and Euro denominated premium receivables and realized foreign exchange gains from the liquidation of an investment portfolio in the United Kingdom. The net losses on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange for 2015 were primarily due to losses from foreign currency revaluation of Chilean Unidad de Fomento denominated premium receivables and foreign exchange currency losses on the sale of Euro denominated investments.\nOTHER NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) Other net realized gains (losses) for 2017 were primarily related to the settlement of litigation. Other net realized losses for 2016 related to the loss recorded to adjust the carrying value of MBIA UK to its fair value less costs to sell prior to the sale.\nREVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIEs For 2017, total revenues of consolidated VIEs were $185 million compared with $31 million for 2016 and $128 million for 2015. The increase in revenues of consolidated VIEs for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily the result of gains related to changes in the fair value of assets within certain VIEs. Fair value gains related to assets were mostly driven by higher collateral values resulting from changes in estimated cash flows. The decrease in revenues of consolidated VIEs for 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in net investment income due to the deconsolidation of VIEs and lower mark-to-market gains on assets of consolidated VIEs. We elected to record at fair value certain instruments that are consolidated under accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs, and as such, changes in fair value are reflected in earnings.\nLOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio management group within our international and structured finance insurance business is responsible for monitoring international and structured finance insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and our assessed performance of the insured issue.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's loss reserving policy and additional information related to its loss reserves.\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nPayment of a claim in November of 2015 on MBIA Corp.'s policy insuring the class A-1 and A-2 notes issued by Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited (\u201cZohar I\u201d) and satisfying the Zohar II Claim entitles MBIA Corp. to reimbursement of such amounts plus interest and expenses and/or to exercise certain rights and remedies to seek recovery of such amounts. In connection with the exercise of its rights and remedies, MBIA Corp. directed the trustee for Zohar I to commence an auction (the \u201cAuction\u201d) of all of the assets of Zohar I, which occurred on December 21, 2016. MBIA Corp. was the winning bidder in the Auction, and in connection therewith, acquired the beneficial ownership of the Zohar I assets, which include loans made to, and equity interests in, companies purportedly controlled by the sponsor and former collateral manager of Zohar I and Zohar II. As of December 31, 2017, the recoveries of Zohar I and Zohar II are included in \u201cLoans receivable at fair value\u201d which are presented in \u201cAssets of consolidated variable interest entities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.

Gross expenses decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to decreases in compensation expense. Gross expenses decreased for 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to decreases in premium taxes and assessments, compensation expense and building related expenses. Operating expenses decreased for 2017 compared with 2016 and 2015 due to decreases in gross expenses.\nThe decreases in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for 2017 compared with 2016 and 2015 were due to higher refunding activity in prior years. We did not defer a material amount of policy acquisition costs during 2017, 2016 or 2015. Policy acquisition costs in these periods were primarily related to ceding commissions and premium taxes on installment policies written in prior periods.\nINTEREST EXPENSE OF CONSOLIDATED VIEs For 2017, total interest expense of consolidated VIEs increased compared with 2016 primarily due to interest expense from the Facility. Refer to \u201cLiquidity\u201d for additional information on the Facility.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nPROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for 2017 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\nInternational and Structured Finance Insurance Portfolio Exposures\nCredit Quality\nThe credit quality of our international and structured finance insured portfolio is assessed in the same manner as our U.S. public finance insured portfolio. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 33% and 25%, respectively, of our international and structured finance insured portfolio, was rated below investment grade, before giving effect to MBIA's guarantees, based on MBIA's internal ratings, which are generally more current than the underlying ratings provided by S&P and Moody's for this subset of our insured portfolio.\nSelected Portfolio Exposures\nThe following is a summary of selected significant exposures within the insured portfolio of our international and structured finance insurance segment. Many of these sectors are and have been considered volatile over the past several years. We may experience considerable incurred losses and future expected payments in certain of these sectors. There can be no assurance that the loss reserves described below will be sufficient or that we will not experience losses on transactions on which we currently have no loss reserves, in particular if the economy deteriorates. We may seek to purchase, directly or indirectly, obligations guaranteed by MBIA Corp. or seek to commute policies. The amount of insurance exposure reduced, if any, and the nature of any such actions will depend on market conditions, pricing levels from time to time, and other considerations. In some cases, these activities may result in a reduction of loss reserves, but in all cases they are intended to limit our ultimate losses and reduce the future volatility in loss development on the related policies. Our determination to purchase guaranteed obligations and/or to commute policies will depend in part on management's assessment of available liquidity.\nResidential Mortgage Exposure\nMBIA Corp. insures mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) backed by residential mortgage loans, including second-lien RMBS transactions (revolving home equity lines of credit (\u201cHELOC\u201d) loans and closed-end second (\u201cCES\u201d) mortgages). MBIA Corp. also insures MBS backed by first-lien alternative A-paper (\u201cAlt-A\u201d) and subprime mortgage loans directly through RMBS securitizations. There was considerable stress and deterioration in the mortgage market since 2008 reflected by heightened delinquencies and losses, particularly related to mortgage loans originated during 2005, 2006 and 2007.\nThe following table presents the gross par outstanding of MBIA Corp.'s total direct RMBS insured exposure as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Amounts include the gross par outstanding related to transactions that the Company consolidates under accounting guidance for VIEs.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>In millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Par Outstanding as of </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> HELOC Second-lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-29% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CES Second-lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-24% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alt-A First-lien(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-18% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subprime First-lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-16% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prime First-lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-66% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-23% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-Includes international exposure of $245 million and $349 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCollateralized Debt Obligations and Related Instruments\nAs part of our international and structured finance insurance activities, MBIA Corp. typically provided guarantees on senior and, in a limited number of cases, mezzanine tranches of CDOs, as well as protection on structured CMBS pools and corporate securities, and CDS referencing such securities. The following discussion, including reported amounts and percentages, includes insured CDO transactions consolidated by the Company as VIEs.\nIn addition to the below table, MBIA Corp. insures approximately $317 million in commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) loan pools, comprising both European and domestic assets. The distribution of our insured CDO and related instruments portfolio by collateral type is presented in the following table:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>In millions </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross Par Outstanding as of </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateral Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-sector CDOs(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-20% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High yield corporate CDOs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Structured CMBS pools\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CRE CDOs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-83% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-Excludes $40 million and $44 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of gross par outstanding where MBIA's insured exposure has been fully offset by way of loss remediation transactions.\nU.S. Public Finance and International and Structured Finance Reinsurance\nReinsurance enables the Company to cede exposure for purposes of syndicating risk. The Company generally retains the right to reassume the business ceded to reinsurers under certain circumstances, including a reinsurer's rating downgrade below specified thresholds. Currently, we do not intend to use reinsurance to decrease the insured exposure in our portfolio. Refer to \u201cNote 13: Insurance in Force\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion about our reinsurance agreements.\nTaxes\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's income taxes and the related effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the following table:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(661) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(339) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-142.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.7% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> For 2017, our effective tax rate applied to our income (loss) before income taxes was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset.\nIn June of 2017, S&P downgraded the financial strength rating of National, which led the Company to cease its efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. In addition to National's cessation of new business activity, there was an increase in loss and LAE due to changes in assumptions on certain Puerto Rico credits. As a result of the increase in loss and LAE, the Company has a three-year cumulative loss, which is considered significant negative evidence in the assessment of its ability to use its net deferred tax asset. In addition, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence as required by GAAP, to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to use its net deferred tax asset. After considering all positive and negative evidence, including the Company's inability to objectively identify and forecast future sources of taxable income, the Company concluded that it does not have sufficient positive evidence to support its ability to use its net deferred tax asset before it expires. Accordingly, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset of $770 million as of December 31, 2017.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNotwithstanding the establishment of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset, the Company believes that it may be able to use some of its net deferred tax asset before the expirations associated with that asset based upon expected earnings at National and potential future sources of taxable income to be identified by the Company. Accordingly, the Company will continue to re-evaluate its net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that the Company will reverse any of its valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset in the future.\nFor 2016, our effective tax rate applied to our income (loss) before income taxes was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the provision for deferred taxes on the basis differences of our foreign subsidiary, MBIA UK, which resulted from the change in assertion of MBIA UK paying future dividends over time to calculating deferred taxes on the basis of the sale of MBIA UK and a valuation allowance against certain foreign tax credits.\nFor 2015, our effective tax rate applied to our income (loss) before income taxes was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to nondeductible equity-based compensation expense.\nRefer to \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes, including the valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset and its accounting for tax uncertainties.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company manages its capital resources to minimize its cost of capital while maintaining appropriate claims-paying resources (\u201cCPR\u201d) for National and MBIA Corp. The Company's capital resources consist of total shareholders' equity, total debt issued by MBIA Inc. for general corporate purposes, surplus notes issued by MBIA Corp., and the Facility issued by MZ Funding. Total capital resources were $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. MBIA Inc. uses its capital resources to support the business activities of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Inc.'s investment in subsidiaries totaled $2.3 billion.\nIn addition to scheduled debt maturities, from time to time, we reduce unsecured debt through calls or repurchases. MBIA Inc. or National may also repurchase outstanding MBIA Inc. common shares when we deem it beneficial to our shareholders. MBIA Inc. also supports the MTN and investment agreement obligations issued by the Company. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet the Company's general corporate needs and debt service. Based on MBIA Inc.'s debt service requirements and expected operating expenses, we expect that MBIA Inc. will have sufficient cash to satisfy its debt obligations and its general corporate needs over time from distributions from its operating subsidiaries; however, there can be no assurance that MBIA Inc. will have sufficient cash to do so. In addition, the Company may also consider raising third-party capital. For further information, refer to \u201cCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and \u201cLiquidity-Corporate Liquidity\u201d section for additional information about MBIA Inc.'s liquidity.\nSecurities Repurchases\nRepurchases of debt and common stock may be made from time to time in the open market or in private transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. We may also choose to redeem debt obligations where permitted by the relevant agreements. MBIA Inc. or National may repurchase or redeem outstanding common shares of MBIA Inc. and outstanding debt obligations at prices when we deem it beneficial to our shareholders.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)\nEquity securities\nThe Company's and National's share repurchases that were authorized under share repurchase programs, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, are presented in the following table:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions except per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of shares repurchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price paid per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining authorization as of December 31\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> On June 27, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for the Company or National to repurchase up to $250 million of the Company's outstanding common shares. This new program replaced the approximately $13 million remaining under the Board's February 23, 2016 authorization.\nDuring 2017, we exhausted the June 27, 2017 repurchase program by repurchasing 34 million common shares of MBIA Inc. at an average share price of $7.35. On November 3, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for the Company or National to repurchase up to $250 million of the Company's outstanding common shares.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017 through February 22, 2018, we repurchased 2 million common shares of MBIA Inc. at an average share price of $7.25 under the November 3, 2017 share repurchase authorization. As of February 22, 2018, $236 million remained available to repurchase under this new program.\nDebt securities\nDuring 2017, we repurchased $160 million par value outstanding of GFL MTNs issued by our corporate segment at a weighted average cost of approximately 84% of par value.\nAlso, during 2017, National purchased from MBIA Inc., $129 million principal amount of MBIA Inc.'s 5.700% Senior Notes due 2034 at a cost of approximately 99% of par value plus accrued interest. These notes had been previously repurchased by MBIA Inc. and had not been retired.\nInsurance Statutory Capital\nNational and MBIA Insurance Corporation are incorporated and licensed in, and are subject to primary insurance regulation and supervision by New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYSDFS\u201d). MBIA Mexico is regulated by the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Seguros y Fianzas in Mexico. MBIA Corp.'s Spanish Branch is subject to local regulation in Spain. National and MBIA Insurance Corporation each are required to file detailed annual financial statements, as well as interim financial statements, with the NYSDFS and similar supervisory agencies in each of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with New York State and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' statements of U.S. STAT and assist our regulators in evaluating minimum standards of solvency, including minimum capital requirements, and business conduct.\nNational\nCapital and Surplus\nNational reported total statutory capital of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared with $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, statutory capital comprised $2.2 billion of policyholders' surplus and $594 million of contingency reserves. National had a statutory net loss of $321 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, National's unassigned surplus was $1.6 billion.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)\nIn order to maintain its New York State financial guarantee insurance license, National is required to maintain a minimum of $65 million of policyholders' surplus. National is also required to maintain contingency reserves to provide protection to policyholders in the event of extreme losses in adverse economic events. Refer to the following \u201cMBIA Insurance Corporation-Capital and Surplus\u201d section for additional information about contingency reserves under New York Insurance Law (\u201cNYIL\u201d).\nNYIL regulates the payment of dividends by financial guarantee insurance companies and provides that such companies may not declare or distribute dividends except out of statutory earned surplus. Under NYIL, the sum of (i) the amount of dividends declared or distributed during the preceding 12-month period and (ii) the dividend to be declared may not exceed the lesser of (a) 10% of policyholders' surplus, as reported in the latest statutory financial statements or (b) 100% of adjusted net investment income for such 12-month period (the net investment income for such 12-month period plus the excess, if any, of net investment income over dividends declared or distributed during the two-year period preceding such 12-month period), unless the Superintendent of the NYSDFS approves a greater dividend distribution based upon a finding that the insurer will retain sufficient surplus to support its obligations.\nNational had positive earned surplus as of December 31, 2017, which provides National with dividend capacity. During 2017, National declared and paid a dividend of $118 million to its ultimate parent, MBIA Inc. We expect the as-of-right declared and paid dividend amounts from National to be limited to prior year net investment income.\nClaims-Paying Resources (Statutory Basis)\nCPR is a key measure of the resources available to National to pay claims under its insurance policies. CPR consists of total financial resources and reserves calculated on a statutory basis. CPR has been a common measure used by financial guarantee insurance companies to report and compare resources and continues to be used by MBIA's management to evaluate changes in such resources. We have provided CPR to allow investors and analysts to evaluate National using the same measure that MBIA's management uses to evaluate National's resources to pay claims under its insurance policies. There is no directly comparable GAAP measure. Our calculation of CPR may differ from the calculation of CPR reported by other companies.\nNational's CPR and components thereto, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policyholders' surplus\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,731 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingency reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,476 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unearned premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>786 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Present value of installment premiums(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premium resources(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>973 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and LAE reserves(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salvage reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross loss and LAE reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total claims-paying resources\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,607 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1)-As </td> <td>of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the discount rate was 3.25% and 3.18%, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(2)-Includes </td> <td>financial guarantee and insured credit derivative related premiums. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)\nMBIA Insurance Corporation\nCapital and Surplus\nMBIA Insurance Corporation reported total statutory capital of $464 million as of December 31, 2017 compared with $492 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, statutory capital comprised $237 million of policyholders' surplus and $227 million of contingency reserves. As of December 31, 2016, statutory capital comprised $238 million of policyholders' surplus and $254 million of contingency reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation had statutory net income of $107 million. MBIA Insurance Corporation's policyholders' surplus included negative unassigned surplus of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. MBIA Insurance Corporation's policyholders' surplus may be further negatively impacted if future additional insured losses are incurred.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MBIA Insurance Corporation's policyholders' surplus was negatively impacted by $112 million, as it was not permitted to treat the portion of its investment in subsidiaries in excess of 60% of net admitted assets less the par value of common and preferred stock and liabilities as an admitted asset, as required under NYIL.\nThe $112 million reduction to policyholders' surplus was reversed in 2017 to reflect the sale of MBIA UK. In addition, in 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation released contingency reserves of approximately $20 million related to the maturity of the Zohar II notes, as well as, recorded income of $20 million related to the appreciation to the par value of certain Zohar II notes received as consideration. Therefore, in 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation's policyholders' surplus increased approximately $152 million as a result of these transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation recognized estimated recoveries of $408 million, net of reinsurance on a statutory basis related to put-back claims against Credit Suisse and $205 million related to excess spread recoveries on RMBS, net of reinsurance. These excess spread recoveries represented 44% of MBIA Insurance Corporation's statutory capital as of December 31, 2017. In addition, MBIA Insurance Corporation has recorded recoveries related to CDOs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will not be delayed in realizing these recoveries. Refer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these recoveries.\nUnder NYIL, MBIA Insurance Corporation is also required to establish a contingency reserve to provide protection to policyholders in the event of extreme losses in adverse economic events. The amount of the reserve is based on the percentage of principal insured or premiums earned, depending on the type of obligation (net of collateral, reinsurance, refunding, refinancings and certain insured securities). Reductions in the contingency reserve may be recognized based on excess reserves and under certain stipulated conditions, subject to the approval of the Superintendent of the NYSDFS. As a result of regulatory approved reductions, MBIA Insurance Corporation's contingency reserves of $227 million as of December 31, 2017 represented reserves on 31 of the 254 outstanding credits insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation.\nIn order to maintain its New York State financial guarantee insurance license, MBIA Insurance Corporation is required to maintain a minimum of $65 million of policyholders' surplus. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Corp. met the required minimum surplus of $65 million. Under NYIL, MBIA Insurance Corporation is required to invest its minimum surplus and contingency reserves and 50% of its loss reserves and unearned premium reserves in certain qualifying assets. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation maintained its minimum requirement of policyholders' surplus but did not have enough qualifying assets to support its contingency reserves and 50% of its loss reserves and unearned premium reserves. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation was in compliance with its aggregate risk limits under the NYIL, but was not in compliance with certain of its single risk limits. Under NYIL, MBIA Insurance Corporation is required to maintain admitted assets greater than the aggregate amount of liabilities and outstanding capital stock. As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation's admitted assets did not exceed the aggregate amount of its liabilities and outstanding capital stock. If MBIA Insurance Corporation is not in compliance with the above mentioned requirements, the NYSDFS may prevent MBIA Insurance Corporation from transacting any new financial guarantee insurance business until it no longer exceeds the limitations.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCAPITAL RESOURCES (continued)\nIn connection with MBIA Insurance Corporation obtaining approval from the NYSDFS to release excess contingency reserves in previous periods, MBIA Insurance Corporation agreed that it would not pay any dividends without prior approval from the NYSDFS. Due to its significant negative earned surplus, MBIA Insurance Corporation has not had the statutory capacity to pay dividends since December 31, 2009. Based on estimated future income, MBIA Insurance Corporation is not expected to have any statutory capacity to pay any dividends.\nThe NYSDFS has not approved MBIA Insurance Corporation's requests to make interest payments on MBIA Insurance Corporation's 14% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Surplus Notes due January 15, 2033 (the \u201cSurplus Notes\u201d) since, and including, the January 15, 2013 interest payment. The NYSDFS has cited both MBIA Insurance Corporation's liquidity and financial condition as well as the availability of \u201cfree and divisible surplus\u201d as the basis for such non-approvals. As of January 15, 2018, the most recent scheduled interest payment date, there was $629 million of unpaid interest on the par amount outstanding of $953 million of the Surplus Notes. Under Section 1307 of the NYIL and the Fiscal Agency Agreement governing the surplus notes, Surplus Note payments may be made only with the prior approval by the NYSDFS and if MBIA Insurance Corporation has sufficient \u201cEligible Surplus\u201d, or as we believe, \u201cfree and divisible surplus\u201d as an appropriate calculation of \u201cEligible Surplus.\u201d As of December 31, 2017, MBIA Insurance Corporation had negative \u201cfree and divisible surplus,\u201d of $54 million. There is no assurance the NYSDFS will approve Surplus Note payments, notwithstanding the sufficiency of MBIA Insurance Corporation's liquidity and financial condition. The unpaid interest on the Surplus Notes will become due on the first business day on or after which MBIA Insurance Corporation obtains approval to pay some or all of such unpaid interest. No interest has been accrued or will accrue on the deferred interest.\nClaims-Paying Resources (Statutory Basis)\nCPR is a key measure of the resources available to MBIA Corp. to pay claims under its insurance policies. CPR consists of total financial resources and reserves calculated on a statutory basis. CPR has been a common measure used by financial guarantee insurance companies to report and compare resources, and continues to be used by MBIA's management to evaluate changes in such resources. We have provided CPR to allow investors and analysts to evaluate MBIA Corp., using the same measure that MBIA's management uses to evaluate MBIA Corp.'s resources to pay claims under its insurance policies. There is no directly comparable GAAP measure. Our calculation of CPR may differ from the calculation of CPR reported by other companies.\nMBIA Corp.'s CPR and components thereto, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Policyholders' surplus\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingency reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unearned premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Present value of installment premiums(1) (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premium resources(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and LAE reserves(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(792) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(207) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salvage reserves(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross loss and LAE reserves\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total claims-paying resources\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,945 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the discount rate was 5.20% and 5.15%, respectively.\n(2)-Includes financial guarantee and insured credit derivative related premiums.\n(3)-This amount primarily consists of expected recoveries related to the Company's CDOs, excess spread and put-backs.\n(4)-Based on the Company's estimate of the remaining life for its insured exposures.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY\nWe use a liquidity risk management framework, the primary objective of which is to match liquidity resources to needs. We monitor our cash and liquid asset resources using daily cash forecasting and stress-scenario testing. Members of MBIA's senior management meet regularly to review liquidity metrics, discuss contingency plans and establish target liquidity levels. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal-entity basis to take into account the legal, regulatory and other limitations on available liquidity resources within the enterprise. The following is a discussion of our liquidity resources and requirements for our holding company and our insurance subsidiaries.\nNational Liquidity\nThe primary sources of cash available to National are:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including proceeds from the sale of assets; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>installment premiums. </td> </tr>\n</table> The primary uses of cash by National are:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments of operating expenses, taxes and funding purchases of MBIA Inc. shares; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on insured transactions; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments of dividends. </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, National held cash and investments of $3.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of which $228 million and $366 million, respectively, were cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments comprised of highly rated commercial paper, money market funds and municipal, U.S. agency and corporate bonds.\nThe insurance policies issued or reinsured by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of payments of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due. In the event of a default in payment of principal, interest or other insured amounts by an issuer, National generally promises to make funds available in the insured amount within one to three business days following notification. In some cases, the amount due can be substantial, particularly if the default occurs on a transaction to which National has a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type principal maturities. The fact that the U.S. public finance insurance segment's financial guarantee contracts generally cannot be accelerated by a party other than the insurer helps to mitigate liquidity risk in this segment.\nCorporate Liquidity\nThe primary sources of cash available to MBIA Inc. are:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>dividends from National; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>release of funds under the tax sharing agreement, which are funded by National; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>available cash and liquid assets not subject to collateral posting requirements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including proceeds from the sale of assets; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>access to capital markets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY (continued)\nThe primary uses of cash by MBIA Inc. are:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>servicing outstanding unsecured corporate debt obligations and MTNs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>meeting collateral posting requirements under investment agreements and derivative arrangements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments related to interest rate swaps; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments of operating expenses; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>funding share repurchases and debt buybacks. </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the liquidity positions of MBIA Inc. which included cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments comprised of highly rated commercial paper, money market funds and municipal, U.S. agency and corporate bonds for general corporate purposes, excluding the amounts held in escrow under its tax sharing agreement, were $419 million and $403 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, $94 million was released to MBIA Inc. under the MBIA group tax sharing agreement and related tax escrow account (\u201cTax Escrow Account\u201d), representing National's liability under the tax sharing agreement for the 2014 tax year. The release was pursuant to the terms of the tax sharing agreement following the expiration of National's two-year NOL carry-back period under U.S. tax rules. As of December 31, 2017, $234 million had been deposited for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, $90 million of these deposits were returned to National as a result of National's 2017 financial results and $18 million was released to MBIA Inc. from the Tax Escrow Account related to the 2015 year. National's tax escrow payment of $108 million for the 2016 tax year is not eligible for release or return until National's 2018 tax liability is calculated. The remaining amount in the tax escrow now represents National's 2016 tax liability. There can be no assurance that any future payments under the Tax Escrow Account from subsidiaries will be released to MBIA Inc. due to deductible or creditable tax attributes of those subsidiaries and/or the market value performance of the assets supporting the Tax Escrow Account.\nBased on our projections of National's and MBIA Corp.'s future earnings and losses, we expect that for the foreseeable future National will be the primary source of dividends and tax sharing agreement payments to MBIA Inc. During 2017, National declared and paid a dividend of $118 million to its ultimate parent, MBIA Inc. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any such future dividends or payments from the tax escrow account under the tax sharing agreement. Also, absent a special dividend subject to the approval of the NYSDFS, we expect the declared and paid dividend amounts from National to be limited to prior year net investment income. Refer to the \u201cCapital Resources - Insurance Statutory Capital\u201d section for additional information on payments of dividends. We do not expect MBIA Inc. to receive distributions from MBIA Corp.\nDuring 2017, National purchased from MBIA Inc., $129 million principal amount of MBIA Inc.'s 5.700% Senior Notes due 2034 at a cost of approximately 99% of par value plus accrued interest. These notes had been previously repurchased by MBIA Inc. and had not been retired. This transaction increased MBIA Inc.'s liquidity position by a total of $130 million and had no impact to the Company's consolidated outstanding debt obligations.\nCurrently, the majority of the cash and securities of MBIA Inc. is pledged against investment agreement liabilities, the Asset Swap (simultaneous repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement) and derivatives, which limits its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales. If the market value or rating eligibility of the assets which are pledged against MBIA Inc.'s obligations were to decline, we would be required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. To mitigate these risks, we seek to maintain cash and liquidity resources that we believe will be sufficient to make all payments due on our obligations and to meet other financial requirements, such as posting collateral. Contingent liquidity resources include: (1) sales of invested assets exposed to credit spread stress risk, which may occur at losses; (2) termination and settlement of interest rate swap agreements; and (3) accessing the capital markets. These actions, if taken, are expected to result in either additional liquidity or reduced exposure to adverse credit spread movements. There can be no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to fully mitigate this risk.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY (continued)\nMBIA Corp. Liquidity\nThe primary sources of cash available to MBIA Corp. are:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>recoveries associated with loss payments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>installment premiums and fees; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including the proceeds from the sale of assets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary uses of cash by MBIA Corp. are:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>loss and LAE or commutation payments on insured transactions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>repayment of the Facility; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payments of operating expenses; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>payment of principal and interest related to its surplus notes, if and to the extent approved by the NYSDFS. Refer to \u201cCapital Resources-Insurance Statutory Capital\u201d for a discussion on the non-approval of requests to the NYSDFS to pay interest on its surplus notes. </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, MBIA Corp. held cash and investments of $271 million and $328 million, respectively, of which $145 million and $201 million, respectively, were cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments comprised of money market funds and municipal, U.S. agency and corporate bonds that were immediately available to MBIA Insurance Corporation.\nInsured transactions that require payment in full of the principal insured at maturity could present liquidity risk for MBIA Corp. as any salvage recoveries from such payments could be recovered over an extended period of time after the payment of the principal amount. MBIA Corp. is generally required to satisfy claims within one to three business days, and as a result seeks to identify potential claims in advance through our monitoring process. While our financial guarantee policies generally cannot be accelerated, thereby helping to mitigate liquidity risk, insurance of CDS and certain other derivative contracts may, in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of certain insolvency or payment defaults, be subject to termination by the counterparty, triggering a claim for the fair value of the contract. In order to monitor liquidity risk and maintain appropriate liquidity resources, we use the same methodology as we use to monitor credit quality and losses within our insured portfolio, including stress scenarios. Refer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our loss process.\nMBIA Corp. has recorded expected excess spread recoveries of $233 million as of December 31, 2017 associated with insured RMBS issues, including recoveries related to consolidated VIEs. MBIA Corp. has also recorded expected recovery amounts related to its claims against Credit Suisse for ineligible mortgage loans included in an MBIA Corp. insured RMBS transaction. In addition, MBIA Insurance Corporation has recorded recoveries related to CDOs. There can be no assurance that it will be successful or not be delayed in realizing these recoveries. During 2017, MBIA Corp. collected $147 million from insured RMBS transactions related to excess spread recoveries and a mortgage insurance settlement with Old Republic Insurance Corporation.\nMBIA Corp. Financing Facility\nIn January of 2017, MBIA Corp. entered into the Facility with the Senior Lenders and with MBIA Inc., pursuant to which the Senior Lenders provided $325 million of senior financing and MBIA Inc. provided $38 million of subordinated financing to MZ Funding, which in turn lent the proceeds of such financing to MBIA Corp. MBIA Inc. also committed to provide an additional $50 million subordinated financing to MZ Funding under certain circumstances, which MZ Funding would then lend to MBIA Corp. For a further discussion of the Facility, refer to \u201cNote 10: Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY (continued)\nAdvances Agreement\nMBIA Inc., National, MBIA Insurance Corporation and certain other affiliates are party to an intercompany advances agreement (the \u201cMBIA Advances Agreement\u201d). The MBIA Advances Agreement permits National to make advances to MBIA Inc. and other MBIA group companies that are party to the agreement at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 0.25%. The agreement also permits other affiliates to make advances to National or MBIA Insurance Corporation at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR minus 0.10%. Advances by National cannot exceed 3% of its net admitted assets as of the last quarter end. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no amounts drawn under the agreement.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nInformation about our consolidated cash flows by category is presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net cash used by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in loss and LAE payments of $113 million and a decrease in investment income received of $35 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest paid of $30 million and an increase in premiums, fees and reimbursements received of $20 million.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from paydowns of held-to-maturity investments of consolidated VIEs of $1.8 billion, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from purchases, sales and paydowns and maturities of available-for-sale investments of $582 million. Net cash provided by investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from paydowns of held-to-maturity investments of consolidated VIEs of $1.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of VIEs in 2016.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY (continued)\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the principal paydowns of consolidated VIE notes of $1.9 billion primarily related to the deconsolidation of VIEs in 2016 and proceeds received from the Facility in 2017, partially offset by an increase in purchases of treasury stock of $220 million. Net cash used by financing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in the principal paydowns of consolidated VIE notes of $1.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of VIEs in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in the purchases of treasury stock of $194 million.\nInvestments\nThe following discussion of investments, including references to consolidated investments, excludes investments reported under \u201cAssets of consolidated variable interest entities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments of VIEs support the repayment of VIE obligations and are not available to settle obligations of MBIA. Our available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) investments comprise high-quality fixed-income securities and short-term investments. Refer to \u201cNote 8: Investments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed discussion about our investments.\nThe following table presents our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2016, AFS investments with a fair value of $466 million reported under \u201cAssets held for sale\u201d within our international and structured finance segment are excluded due to

net of applicable deferred income taxes, are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.\n(2)-Changes in fair value and realized gains and losses from the sale of these investments are reflected in net income.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nLIQUIDITY (continued)\nThe fair value of the Company's investments is based on prices which include quoted prices in active markets and prices based on market-based inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, as well as prices from dealers in relevant markets. Differences between fair value and amortized cost arise primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and general market credit spreads occurring after a fixed-income security is purchased, although other factors may also influence fair value, including specific credit-related changes, supply and demand forces and other market factors. When the Company holds an AFS investment to maturity, any unrealized gain or loss currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet is reversed. As a result, the Company would realize a value substantially equal to amortized cost. However, when investments are sold prior to maturity, the Company will realize any difference between amortized cost and the sale price of an investment as a realized gain or loss within its consolidated statements of operations.\nCredit Quality\nThe credit quality distribution of the Company's AFS fixed-maturity investment portfolios, excluding short-term investments, are based on ratings from Moody's and alternate ratings sources, such as S&P or the best estimate of the ratings assigned by the Company, have been used for a small percentage of securities that are not rated by Moody's. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average credit quality ratings and percentage of investment grade of the Company's AFS fixed-maturity investment portfolios, excluding short-term investments, are presented in the following table:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. Public\nFinance Insurance </td> <td> </td> <td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>International and\nStructured\nFinance Insurance </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average credit quality ratings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Aa </td> <td> </td> <td>Aa </td> <td> </td> <td>Aa </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Aa </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment grade percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>96% </td> <td> </td> <td>97% </td> <td> </td> <td>90% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Insured Investments\nMBIA's consolidated investment portfolio includes investments that are insured by various financial guarantee insurers (\u201cInsured Investments\u201d), including investments insured by National and MBIA Corp. (\u201cCompany-Insured Investments\u201d). When purchasing Insured Investments, the Company's third-party portfolio manager independently assesses the underlying credit quality, structure and liquidity of each investment, in addition to the creditworthiness of the insurer. Insured Investments are diverse by sector, issuer and size of holding. The third-party portfolio manager assigns underlying ratings to Insured Investments without giving effect to financial guarantees based on underlying ratings assigned by Moody's or S&P, when a rating is not published by Moody's. When a Moody's or S&P underlying rating is not available, the underlying rating is based on the portfolio manager's best estimate of the rating of such investment. A downgrade of a financial guarantee insurer has historically had an adverse effect on the fair value of investments insured by the downgraded financial guarantee insurer. If the Company determines that declines in the fair values of Insured Investments are other-than-temporary, the Company will record a realized loss through earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Insured Investments at fair value represented $391 million or 8% of consolidated investments, of which $274 million or 6% of consolidated investments were Company-Insured Investments. As of December 31, 2017, based on the actual or estimated underlying ratings of our consolidated investment portfolio, without giving effect to financial guarantees, the weighted average rating of only the Insured Investments in the investment portfolio would be in the below investment grade range. Without giving effect to the National and MBIA Corp. guarantees of the Company-Insured Investments in the consolidated investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2017, based on actual or estimated underlying ratings, the weighted average rating of the consolidated investment portfolio was in the Aa range. The weighted average rating of only the Company-Insured Investments was in the below investment grade range, and investments rated below investment grade in the Company-Insured Investments were 5% of the total consolidated investment portfolio.\nItem 7.

Excludes intercompany reinsurance agreements.\nGross insurance claim obligations represent the future value of probability-weighted payments MBIA expects to make (before reinsurance and the consolidation of VIEs) under insurance policies for which the Company has recorded loss reserves (financial guarantees) or has estimated credit impairments (insured derivatives). Certain policies included in gross insurance claim obligations are presented net of expected recoveries. The discounted value of estimated payments included in the table, along with probability-weighted estimated recoveries and estimated negotiated early settlements, on policies accounted for as financial guarantee insurance contracts is reported as case basis reserves within \u201cLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves\u201d on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Insured derivatives are recorded at fair value and reported within \u201cDerivative liabilities\u201d on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Estimated potential claim payments on obligations issued by VIEs consolidated in our international and structured finance insurance segment are included within \u201cGross insurance claim obligations\u201d in the preceding table. Obligations of these VIEs are collateralized by assets held by the VIEs, and investors in such obligations do not have recourse to the general credit of MBIA. As of December 31, 2017, VIE notes issued by issuer-sponsored consolidated VIEs totaled $2.3 billion, including $1.1 billion recorded at fair value, and are not considered contractual obligations of MBIA beyond MBIA's insurance claim obligation. The Company's involvement with VIEs is continually reassessed as required by consolidation guidance, and may result in consolidation or deconsolidation of VIEs in future periods. As the Company consolidates and deconsolidates VIEs, the amount of VIE debt obligations recorded on its balance sheet may change significantly.\nLong-term debt, investment agreements, MTNs, surplus notes and the MBIA Corp. Financing Facility include principal and interest and exclude premiums or discounts. Liabilities issued at discounts reflect principal due at maturity. Interest payments on floating rate obligations are estimated using applicable forward rates. Principal and interest on callable obligations or obligations that allow investors to withdraw funds prior to legal maturity are based on the expected call or withdrawal dates of such obligations. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are presented in U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates as of December 31, 2017.\nItem 7.

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of MBIA Inc. should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. In addition, this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes statements of the opinion of MBIA Inc.'s management which may be forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. Refer to \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties.\nINTRODUCTION\nMBIA Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, \u201cMBIA\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) operates within the financial guarantee insurance industry. MBIA manages its business within three operating segments: 1) United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation (\u201cNational\u201d), our corporate segment is operated through MBIA Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, including our service company, MBIA Services Corporation (\u201cMBIA Services\u201d) and our international and structured finance insurance business is primarily operated through MBIA Insurance Corporation and its subsidiaries (\u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d). Effective on January 10, 2017, MBIA Corp.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA UK (Holdings) Limited (\u201cMBIA UK Holdings\u201d), sold its operating subsidiary, MBIA UK Insurance Limited (\u201cMBIA UK\u201d), to Assured Guaranty Corp. (\u201cAssured\u201d), a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. References to MBIA Inc. generally refer to activities within our corporate segment and, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d are (i) for any references relating to the period ended January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, MBIA UK, and MBIA Mexico S.A. de C.V (\u201cMBIA Mexico\u201d) and (ii) for any references relating to the period after January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation together with MBIA Mexico.\nNational's primary objective is to maximize the economics of our existing insured portfolio, including our insured exposure with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (\u201cPuerto Rico\u201d), through effective surveillance and remediation and to manage its investment portfolio. Our corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA's operating subsidiaries and asset and capital management. MBIA Corp.'s primary objectives are to satisfy claims for its policyholders, maximize future recoveries, if any, for its senior lending and other surplus note holders and, then its preferred stock holders. MBIA Corp. is executing this strategy by pursuing various actions focused on maximizing the collection of recoveries and reducing and mitigating potential losses on its insurance exposures. We do not expect National and MBIA Corp. to write new business.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2017 Events\nThe following is a summary of notable 2017 events:\n \u2022 In July of 2017, Puerto Rico defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds. National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $242 million during 2017. On January 1, 2018, Puerto Rico also defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $69 million. As of December 31, 2017, National had $3.4 billion of gross insured par outstanding ($3.9 billion of gross insured par outstanding when including accreted interest on insured capital appreciation bonds (\u201cCABs\u201d)) related to Puerto Rico. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW (continued)\n \u2022 In the second quarter of 2017, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (\u201cS&P\u201d) downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. We believe that National's ability to write new business and to compete with other financial guarantors was largely dependent on the financial strength ratings assigned to National by major rating agencies, and with the A rating assigned by S&P, it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors. Therefore, at that time, we ceased our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. National immediately initiated cost savings measures related to the cessation of new business, which included reducing our headcount by approximately 25%. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $8 million of costs associated with the headcount reduction. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance\u201d section for additional information on the U.S. public finance insurance business and the below discussion \u201cFinancial Strength Ratings\u201d for additional information about our ratings. \n \u2022 In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. The full valuation allowance resulted from our conclusion that, at this time, we do not have sufficient positive evidence required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to support our ability to use our net deferred tax asset before it expires. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. Notwithstanding the establishment of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset, the Company believes that it may be able to derive some economic benefit over time from its net deferred tax asset before the expirations associated with that asset based upon expected earnings at National and potential future sources of taxable income to be identified by the Company. \n \u2022 In the first quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of MBIA UK and executed a secured financing facility which enabled MBIA Corp. to satisfy a claim of $770 million on an insurance policy insuring certain notes issued by Zohar II 2005-1, Limited (\u201cZohar II\u201d). Refer to the following \u201cResults of Operations\u201d and \u201cLiquidity\u201d sections for a further discussion of the sale of MBIA UK and the financing facility. \n \u2022 In September of 2017, William C. Fallon replaced Joseph W. Brown as Chief Executive Officer of MBIA Inc., bringing to conclusion MBIA Inc.'s long-term succession plan, which had been implemented over the past two years.  Financial Highlights\nThe following tables present our financial highlights. A detailed discussion of our financial results is presented within the \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section included herein. Refer to the \u201cCapital Resources-Insurance Statutory Capital\u201d section for a discussion of National's and MBIA Insurance Corporation's capital positions under statutory accounting principles (\u201cU.S. STAT\u201d).\n\n(1)-Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures were previously referred to as operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) per diluted share. Refer to the following \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section for a discussion of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share to adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW (continued)\n\n(1)-Adjusted book value per share is a non-GAAP measure. Refer to the following \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section for a discussion of adjusted book value and a reconciliation of GAAP book value per share to adjusted book value per share.\nFinancial Strength Ratings\nDuring 2017, MBIA Inc., on behalf of its subsidiaries, National and MBIA Corp., provided notice to Moody's Investors Services (\u201cMoody's\u201d) and S&P terminating the agreements by which Moody's and S&P agreed to provide financial strength ratings to MBIA Inc., National, MBIA Corp. and MBIA Mexico. Also in 2017, National provided notice to Kroll Bond Rating Agency (\u201cKroll\u201d) terminating the agreement by which Kroll agreed to provide a financial strength rating to National. In December of 2017, S&P affirmed National's A with a stable outlook rating and subsequently withdrew all of its ratings and Kroll downgraded National's rating from AA+ to AA with a negative outlook and subsequently withdrew its rating. In January of 2018, Moody's downgraded National's rating to Baa2 from A3 with a stable outlook, affirmed MBIA Corp.'s rating at Caa1 with a developing outlook, downgraded MBIA Inc.'s rating to Ba3 with a stable outlook from Ba1 with a negative outlook, and affirmed MBIA Mexico's Caa1/B3.mx with a developing outlook rating. Moody's, at its discretion and in the absence of a contract with the Company, continues to maintain ratings on MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nEconomic and Financial Market Trends\nThe U.S. economy continued to improve during the fourth quarter of 2017. The labor market remains strong and economic activity has been increasing steadily. In addition, U.S. home prices across the country have maintained a positive trajectory over the year and there has been an increase in business investment. Gross domestic product increased during the quarter, driven by consumer spending and business investment and unplanned spending due to the effects of the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) increased its target for the federal funds rate in December of 2017 by 25 basis points citing the economic factors of a strong labor market and solid economic growth along with low inflation. There is an expectation of three rate increases in 2018. The FOMC stated that it will continue to monitor economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation as they work to a path towards a relatively gradual normalization of rates. Congress successfully passed comprehensive tax reform in December of 2017 which includes a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. Tax reform, along with Congress' emphasis on a reduction in regulation, is expected to lead to continued economic growth.\nEconomic and financial market trends could impact MBIA's business outlook and its financial results. Many states and municipalities have experienced growing tax collections that resulted from increased economic activity and higher assessed property valuations. The economic improvement at the state and local level strengthens the credit quality of the issuers of our insured municipal bonds, improves the performance of our insured U.S. public finance portfolio and could reduce the amount of National's potential incurred losses. In addition, higher projected interest rates could yield increased returns on our Company's investment portfolio. A decrease in oil prices could have a positive impact on certain sales taxes to the extent consumer spending increases as a result. However, some states and municipalities will experience a decrease in revenues where their economies are reliant on the oil and gas industries.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. The following accounting estimates are viewed by management to be critical because they require significant judgment on the part of management. Management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. Financial results could be materially different if other methodologies were used or if management modified its assumptions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense (\u201cLAE\u201d) reserves are established by loss reserve committees in each of our major operating insurance companies (National and MBIA Insurance Corporation) and reviewed by our executive Loss Reserve Committee, which consists of members of senior management. Loss and LAE reserves include case basis reserves and accruals for LAE incurred with respect to non-derivative financial guarantees. Case basis reserves represent our estimate of expected losses to be paid under insurance contracts, net of expected recoveries, on insured obligations that have defaulted or are expected to default. These reserves require the use of judgment and estimates with respect to the occurrence, timing and amount of paid losses and recoveries on insured obligations. Given that the reserves are based on such estimates and assumptions, there can be no assurance that the actual ultimate losses will not be greater than or less than such estimates, resulting in the Company recognizing additional or reversing excess loss and LAE reserves through earnings.\nWe take into account a number of variables in establishing specific case basis reserves for individual policies that depend primarily on the nature of the underlying insured obligation. These variables include the nature and creditworthiness of the issuers of the insured obligations, expected recovery rates on unsecured obligations, the projected cash flow or market value of any assets pledged as collateral on secured obligations, and the expected rates of recovery, cash flow or market values on such obligations or assets. Factors that may affect the actual ultimate realized losses for any policy include economic conditions and trends, political developments, the extent to which sellers/servicers comply with the representations or warranties made in connection therewith, levels of interest rates, rates of inflation, borrower behavior, the default rate and salvage values of specific collateral, and our ability to enforce contractual rights through litigation and otherwise. Our remediation strategy for an insured obligation that has defaulted or is expected to default may also have an impact on our loss reserves.\nIn establishing case basis loss reserves, we calculate the present value of probability-weighted estimated loss payments, net of estimated recoveries, using a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate applicable to the currency and the weighted average remaining life of the insurance contract. Yields on U.S. Treasury offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in U.S. dollars, which represent the majority of our loss reserves. Similarly, yields on foreign government offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a comprehensive discussion of our loss reserves and recoveries, including critical accounting estimates used in the determination of these amounts.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into the three-level hierarchy according to accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures based on the significance of pricing inputs to the measurement in its entirety. Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in markets that are not active where significant inputs are observable are generally categorized as Level 2, and fair value measurements of financial instruments where significant inputs are not observable are generally categorized as Level 3. We categorize our financial instruments based on the lowest level category at which we can generate reliable fair values. The determination of reliability requires management to exercise judgment. The degree of judgment used to determine the fair values of financial instruments generally correlates to the degree that pricing is not observable.\nThe fair value measurements of financial instruments held or issued by the Company are determined through the use of observable market data when available. Market data is obtained from a variety of third-party sources, including dealer quotes. If dealer quotes are not available for an instrument that is infrequently traded, we use alternate valuation methods, including either dealer quotes for similar contracts or modeling using market data inputs. The use of alternate valuation methods generally requires considerable judgment in the application of estimates and assumptions and changes to these variables may produce materially different values.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nThe fair value pricing of assets and liabilities is a function of many components which include interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. For financial instruments that are internally valued by the Company, as well as those for which the Company uses broker quotes or pricing services, credit risk is typically incorporated by using appropriate credit spreads or discount rates as inputs. Substantially all of the Company's investments carried and reported at fair value are priced by independent third parties, including pricing services and brokers.\nInstruments that trade infrequently and, therefore, have little or no price transparency are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Also included in Level 3 are financial instruments that have significant unobservable inputs deemed significant to the instrument's overall fair value. Level 3 assets represented approximately 30% and 21% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represented approximately 41% and 37% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRefer to \u201cNote 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value, including valuation techniques and significant inputs.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recorded with respect to the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements that will result in deductible or taxable amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Our temporary differences relate principally to net operating losses, premium revenue recognition, accrued interest on outstanding surplus notes, insured loss reserves, unrealized gains or losses on investments and insured derivatives and deferred acquisition costs.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets. Changes in the amount of a valuation allowance are reflected within our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. Determining whether to establish a valuation allowance and, if so, the amount of the valuation allowance requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such tax benefits will be realized in future periods prior to the expiration of the deferred tax assets.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future federal pre-tax income. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses. Actual future taxable income or loss could be significantly different from our projections. In evaluating the objective evidence that recent results provide, we consider the prior three years of cumulative pre-tax comprehensive income (loss). We consider a trend of comprehensive income to be positive evidence of our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset and a trend of comprehensive losses to be negative evidence.\nDuring 2017, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. The Company will continue to analyze the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to \u201cNote 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of accounting guidance recently adopted by the Company.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary of Consolidated Results\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n 2017 vs. 2016\nThe increase in consolidated total revenues was primarily due to an impairment loss related to the sale of MBIA UK recorded in 2016, gains related to changes in the fair values of assets of consolidated variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and warrants on MBIA Inc. stock and a realized gain related to the settlement of litigation, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on Euro denominated liabilities due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, an increase in net investment losses related to other-than-temporary impairments (\u201cOTTI\u201d) and lower net premiums earned due to higher refunding activity in 2016. The increase in OTTI related to several impaired securities for which a loss was recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $683 million and $220 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured first-lien residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d).\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes increased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe decrease in consolidated total revenues was primarily due to an impairment loss related to the sale of MBIA UK, a decrease in net gains on insured derivatives and lower net premiums earned due to higher refunding activity in 2015. Net losses on insured derivatives in 2016 were primarily the result of claim payments on commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) transactions. Net gains on insured derivatives in 2015 were principally the result of changes in transaction-specific factors, such as credit ratings, partially offset by claim payments.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $220 million and $123 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured second-lien RMBS transactions, partially offset by decreases in insured collateralized debt obligation (\u201cCDO\u201d) losses.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nIn addition to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also analyze the operating performance of the Company using adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, both non-GAAP measures. Previously, these non-GAAP measures were referred to as combined operating income (loss) and combined operating income (loss) per diluted common share. There was no change to the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. There was only a change to the names of these non-GAAP measures. Since adjusted net income (loss) is used by management to assess performance and make business decisions, we consider adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share fundamental measures of periodic financial performance which are useful in understanding our results. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are not substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted common share determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definitions of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share include the after-tax results of the Company and remove the after-tax results of our international and structured finance insurance segment, which is not part of our ongoing business strategy, as well as the following:\n \u2022 Elimination of the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments that primarily include interest rate swaps and hybrid financial instruments. Also eliminated are the mark-to-market gains (losses) on warrants issued by the Company. All of these amounts fluctuate based on market interest rates, credit spreads, MBIA Inc.'s common stock price and other market factors. \n \u2022 Elimination of foreign exchange gains (losses) on the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies. Given the possibility of volatility in foreign exchange markets, we exclude the impact of foreign exchange gains (losses) to provide a measurement of comparability of adjusted net income (loss). \n \u2022 Elimination of gains (losses) on the sale of investments, net investment losses related to OTTI and net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt since the timing of these transactions are subject to management's assessment of market opportunities and capital liquidity positions. \n \u2022 Elimination of the tax provision as a result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset in 2017. \nThe following table presents our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share and provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n(1)-Reported within \u201cNet gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange\u201d on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)-Primarily relates to the results from the sale of Cutwater.\n(3)-Reported within \u201cProvision (benefit) for income taxes\u201d on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\n(4)-Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share is calculated by taking adjusted net income (loss) divided by GAAP weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding.\n(5)-Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share is calculated by taking adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, which includes the GAAP diluted weighted average number of common shares of 133,001,088 and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents of 444,557 shares.\nAdjusted Book Value\nIn addition to book value per share, we also analyze adjusted book value (\u201cABV\u201d) per share, a non-GAAP measure. We consider ABV a measure of fundamental value of the Company and the change in ABV an important measure of financial performance. ABV adjusts GAAP book value to remove the legal entity book value of MBIA Corp. In addition, ABV adjusts for certain items which the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value through GAAP earnings and other comprehensive income, as well as add in the impact of certain items which the Company believes will be realized in GAAP book value in future periods. The Company has limited such adjustments to those items that it deems to be important to fundamental value and performance and for which the likelihood and amount can be reasonably estimated. We have presented ABV to allow investors and analysts to evaluate the Company using the same measure that MBIA's management regularly uses to measure financial performance and value. ABV is not a substitute for and should not be viewed in isolation of GAAP book value, and our definition of ABV may differ from that used by other companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ABV per share was $29.32, a decrease from $31.88 as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in ABV per share was primarily driven by the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax asset and losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures, partially offset by a decrease in common shares outstanding from the share repurchases made by the Company during 2017. The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated book value per share to consolidated ABV per share:\n\n(1)-The book value of the MBIA Corp. legal entity does not provide significant economic or shareholder value to MBIA Inc.\n(2)-Consists of financial guarantee premiums, net of deferred acquisition costs. The discount rate on financial guarantee installment premiums was the risk-free rate as defined by the accounting principles for financial guarantee insurance contracts.\n(3)-As of December 31, 2017, ABV per share was adjusted by applying a zero effective tax rate to the book value adjustments.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nU.S. Public Finance Insurance\nOur U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National. The financial guarantees issued by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due or, in the event National has exercised, at its discretion, the right to accelerate the payment under its policies upon the acceleration of the underlying insured obligations due to default or otherwise. National's guarantees insure municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions, as well as utility districts, airports, healthcare institutions, higher educational facilities, student loan issuers, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, user fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. As of December 31, 2017, National had total insured gross par outstanding of $71.9 billion.\nOn June 26, 2017, S&P downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. S&P noted that the downgrade of National was based on its view that National had not gained wide market acceptance as demonstrated by its low new business volume. We determined that with the A rating it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors, and therefore, we ceased at that time our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. Subsequent to the S&P financial strength rating downgrade, National terminated its agreement for ratings from S&P, Moody's and Kroll.\nNational continues to surveil and remediate its existing insured portfolio and will seek opportunities to enhance shareholder value using its strong financial resources, while protecting the interests of its policyholders. Certain state and local governments and territory obligors that National insures remain under financial and budgetary stress. This could lead to an increase in defaults by such entities on the payment of their obligations and losses or impairments on a greater number of the Company's insured transactions. In particular, Puerto Rico is experiencing significant fiscal stress and constrained liquidity due to, among other things, Puerto Rico's structural budget imbalance, the lack of access to the capital markets, a stagnating local economy, net migration of people out of Puerto Rico and a high debt burden. Although Puerto Rico has tried to address its challenges through various fiscal policies, it continues to experience significant fiscal stress. Also, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane resulting in catastrophic damage to much of the island's basic infrastructure, including its electrical transmission and distribution grid, telecommunications network, housing, roads, bridges, water and sewer systems. On September 21, 2017, the President of the United States approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) made federal disaster assistance available to Puerto Rico to supplement its recovery efforts. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. We continue to monitor and analyze these situations and other stressed credits closely, and the overall extent and duration of this stress is uncertain.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe following table presents our U.S. public finance insurance segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n n/m-Percent change not meaningful. \nNET PREMIUMS EARNED Net premiums earned on financial guarantees represent gross premiums earned net of premiums ceded to reinsurers, and include scheduled premium earnings and premium earnings from refunded issues. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2017 compared with 2016 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $41 million and scheduled premiums earned of $21 million. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2016 compared with 2015 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $42 million and scheduled premiums earned of $26 million. Scheduled premium earnings declined due to the refunding and maturity of insured issues in prior periods. Refunding activity over the past several years has accelerated premium earnings in prior periods and reduced the amount of scheduled premiums that would have been earned in the current period.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange primarily relate to net realized gains from the sales of securities as a result of favorable market conditions. In 2016, the increase in these net realized gains was primarily due to generating liquidity for anticipated claim payments on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nNET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS Net investment losses related to OTTI for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to impaired securities for which losses were recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value or recovery value. This OTTI resulted from liquidity concerns, recent credit rating downgrades and other adverse financial conditions of the issuers.\nLOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES National's insured portfolio management group within our U.S. public finance insurance segment is responsible for monitoring our U.S. public finance insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and performance of the insured issue.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's loss reserving policy and additional information related to its loss reserves.\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of MBIA Inc. should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. In addition, this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes statements of the opinion of MBIA Inc.'s management which may be forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. Refer to \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties.\nINTRODUCTION\nMBIA Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, \u201cMBIA\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) operates within the financial guarantee insurance industry. MBIA manages its business within three operating segments: 1) United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation (\u201cNational\u201d), our corporate segment is operated through MBIA Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, including our service company, MBIA Services Corporation (\u201cMBIA Services\u201d) and our international and structured finance insurance business is primarily operated through MBIA Insurance Corporation and its subsidiaries (\u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d). Effective on January 10, 2017, MBIA Corp.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, MBIA UK (Holdings) Limited (\u201cMBIA UK Holdings\u201d), sold its operating subsidiary, MBIA UK Insurance Limited (\u201cMBIA UK\u201d), to Assured Guaranty Corp. (\u201cAssured\u201d), a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. References to MBIA Inc. generally refer to activities within our corporate segment and, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cMBIA Corp.\u201d are (i) for any references relating to the period ended January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, MBIA UK, and MBIA Mexico S.A. de C.V (\u201cMBIA Mexico\u201d) and (ii) for any references relating to the period after January 10, 2017, to MBIA Insurance Corporation together with MBIA Mexico.\nNational's primary objective is to maximize the economics of our existing insured portfolio, including our insured exposure with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (\u201cPuerto Rico\u201d), through effective surveillance and remediation and to manage its investment portfolio. Our corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA's operating subsidiaries and asset and capital management. MBIA Corp.'s primary objectives are to satisfy claims for its policyholders, maximize future recoveries, if any, for its senior lending and other surplus note holders and, then its preferred stock holders. MBIA Corp. is executing this strategy by pursuing various actions focused on maximizing the collection of recoveries and reducing and mitigating potential losses on its insurance exposures. We do not expect National and MBIA Corp. to write new business.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2017 Events\nThe following is a summary of notable 2017 events:\n \u2022 In July of 2017, Puerto Rico defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds. National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $242 million during 2017. On January 1, 2018, Puerto Rico also defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $69 million. As of December 31, 2017, National had $3.4 billion of gross insured par outstanding ($3.9 billion of gross insured par outstanding when including accreted interest on insured capital appreciation bonds (\u201cCABs\u201d)) related to Puerto Rico. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW (continued)\n \u2022 In the second quarter of 2017, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (\u201cS&P\u201d) downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. We believe that National's ability to write new business and to compete with other financial guarantors was largely dependent on the financial strength ratings assigned to National by major rating agencies, and with the A rating assigned by S&P, it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors. Therefore, at that time, we ceased our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. National immediately initiated cost savings measures related to the cessation of new business, which included reducing our headcount by approximately 25%. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $8 million of costs associated with the headcount reduction. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance\u201d section for additional information on the U.S. public finance insurance business and the below discussion \u201cFinancial Strength Ratings\u201d for additional information about our ratings. \n \u2022 In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. The full valuation allowance resulted from our conclusion that, at this time, we do not have sufficient positive evidence required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to support our ability to use our net deferred tax asset before it expires. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset. Notwithstanding the establishment of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset, the Company believes that it may be able to derive some economic benefit over time from its net deferred tax asset before the expirations associated with that asset based upon expected earnings at National and potential future sources of taxable income to be identified by the Company. \n \u2022 In the first quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of MBIA UK and executed a secured financing facility which enabled MBIA Corp. to satisfy a claim of $770 million on an insurance policy insuring certain notes issued by Zohar II 2005-1, Limited (\u201cZohar II\u201d). Refer to the following \u201cResults of Operations\u201d and \u201cLiquidity\u201d sections for a further discussion of the sale of MBIA UK and the financing facility. \n \u2022 In September of 2017, William C. Fallon replaced Joseph W. Brown as Chief Executive Officer of MBIA Inc., bringing to conclusion MBIA Inc.'s long-term succession plan, which had been implemented over the past two years.  Financial Highlights\nThe following tables present our financial highlights. A detailed discussion of our financial results is presented within the \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section included herein. Refer to the \u201cCapital Resources-Insurance Statutory Capital\u201d section for a discussion of National's and MBIA Insurance Corporation's capital positions under statutory accounting principles (\u201cU.S. STAT\u201d).\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions except for per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,605) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per diluted share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.50) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.54) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income (loss)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(410) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.45) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of shares repurchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share are non-GAAP measures.

Refer to the following \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section for a discussion of adjusted book value and a reconciliation of GAAP book value per share to adjusted book value per share.\nFinancial Strength Ratings\nDuring 2017, MBIA Inc., on behalf of its subsidiaries, National and MBIA Corp., provided notice to Moody's Investors Services (\u201cMoody's\u201d) and S&P terminating the agreements by which Moody's and S&P agreed to provide financial strength ratings to MBIA Inc., National, MBIA Corp. and MBIA Mexico. Also in 2017, National provided notice to Kroll Bond Rating Agency (\u201cKroll\u201d) terminating the agreement by which Kroll agreed to provide a financial strength rating to National. In December of 2017, S&P affirmed National's A with a stable outlook rating and subsequently withdrew all of its ratings and Kroll downgraded National's rating from AA+ to AA with a negative outlook and subsequently withdrew its rating. In January of 2018, Moody's downgraded National's rating to Baa2 from A3 with a stable outlook, affirmed MBIA Corp.'s rating at Caa1 with a developing outlook, downgraded MBIA Inc.'s rating to Ba3 with a stable outlook from Ba1 with a negative outlook, and affirmed MBIA Mexico's Caa1/B3.mx with a developing outlook rating. Moody's, at its discretion and in the absence of a contract with the Company, continues to maintain ratings on MBIA Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nEconomic and Financial Market Trends\nThe U.S. economy continued to improve during the fourth quarter of 2017. The labor market remains strong and economic activity has been increasing steadily. In addition, U.S. home prices across the country have maintained a positive trajectory over the year and there has been an increase in business investment. Gross domestic product increased during the quarter, driven by consumer spending and business investment and unplanned spending due to the effects of the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) increased its target for the federal funds rate in December of 2017 by 25 basis points citing the economic factors of a strong labor market and solid economic growth along with low inflation. There is an expectation of three rate increases in 2018. The FOMC stated that it will continue to monitor economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation as they work to a path towards a relatively gradual normalization of rates. Congress successfully passed comprehensive tax reform in December of 2017 which includes a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. Tax reform, along with Congress' emphasis on a reduction in regulation, is expected to lead to continued economic growth.\nEconomic and financial market trends could impact MBIA's business outlook and its financial results. Many states and municipalities have experienced growing tax collections that resulted from increased economic activity and higher assessed property valuations. The economic improvement at the state and local level strengthens the credit quality of the issuers of our insured municipal bonds, improves the performance of our insured U.S. public finance portfolio and could reduce the amount of National's potential incurred losses. In addition, higher projected interest rates could yield increased returns on our Company's investment portfolio. A decrease in oil prices could have a positive impact on certain sales taxes to the extent consumer spending increases as a result. However, some states and municipalities will experience a decrease in revenues where their economies are reliant on the oil and gas industries.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. The following accounting estimates are viewed by management to be critical because they require significant judgment on the part of management. Management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. Financial results could be materially different if other methodologies were used or if management modified its assumptions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense (\u201cLAE\u201d) reserves are established by loss reserve committees in each of our major operating insurance companies (National and MBIA Insurance Corporation) and reviewed by our executive Loss Reserve Committee, which consists of members of senior management. Loss and LAE reserves include case basis reserves and accruals for LAE incurred with respect to non-derivative financial guarantees. Case basis reserves represent our estimate of expected losses to be paid under insurance contracts, net of expected recoveries, on insured obligations that have defaulted or are expected to default. These reserves require the use of judgment and estimates with respect to the occurrence, timing and amount of paid losses and recoveries on insured obligations. Given that the reserves are based on such estimates and assumptions, there can be no assurance that the actual ultimate losses will not be greater than or less than such estimates, resulting in the Company recognizing additional or reversing excess loss and LAE reserves through earnings.\nWe take into account a number of variables in establishing specific case basis reserves for individual policies that depend primarily on the nature of the underlying insured obligation. These variables include the nature and creditworthiness of the issuers of the insured obligations, expected recovery rates on unsecured obligations, the projected cash flow or market value of any assets pledged as collateral on secured obligations, and the expected rates of recovery, cash flow or market values on such obligations or assets. Factors that may affect the actual ultimate realized losses for any policy include economic conditions and trends, political developments, the extent to which sellers/servicers comply with the representations or warranties made in connection therewith, levels of interest rates, rates of inflation, borrower behavior, the default rate and salvage values of specific collateral, and our ability to enforce contractual rights through litigation and otherwise. Our remediation strategy for an insured obligation that has defaulted or is expected to default may also have an impact on our loss reserves.\nIn establishing case basis loss reserves, we calculate the present value of probability-weighted estimated loss payments, net of estimated recoveries, using a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate applicable to the currency and the weighted average remaining life of the insurance contract. Yields on U.S. Treasury offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in U.S. dollars, which represent the majority of our loss reserves. Similarly, yields on foreign government offerings are used to discount loss reserves denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a comprehensive discussion of our loss reserves and recoveries, including critical accounting estimates used in the determination of these amounts.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into the three-level hierarchy according to accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures based on the significance of pricing inputs to the measurement in its entirety. Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in markets that are not active where significant inputs are observable are generally categorized as Level 2, and fair value measurements of financial instruments where significant inputs are not observable are generally categorized as Level 3. We categorize our financial instruments based on the lowest level category at which we can generate reliable fair values. The determination of reliability requires management to exercise judgment. The degree of judgment used to determine the fair values of financial instruments generally correlates to the degree that pricing is not observable.\nThe fair value measurements of financial instruments held or issued by the Company are determined through the use of observable market data when available. Market data is obtained from a variety of third-party sources, including dealer quotes. If dealer quotes are not available for an instrument that is infrequently traded, we use alternate valuation methods, including either dealer quotes for similar contracts or modeling using market data inputs. The use of alternate valuation methods generally requires considerable judgment in the application of estimates and assumptions and changes to these variables may produce materially different values.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES (continued)\nThe fair value pricing of assets and liabilities is a function of many components which include interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. For financial instruments that are internally valued by the Company, as well as those for which the Company uses broker quotes or pricing services, credit risk is typically incorporated by using appropriate credit spreads or discount rates as inputs. Substantially all of the Company's investments carried and reported at fair value are priced by independent third parties, including pricing services and brokers.\nInstruments that trade infrequently and, therefore, have little or no price transparency are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Also included in Level 3 are financial instruments that have significant unobservable inputs deemed significant to the instrument's overall fair value. Level 3 assets represented approximately 30% and 21% of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Level 3 liabilities represented approximately 41% and 37% of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRefer to \u201cNote 7: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value, including valuation techniques and significant inputs.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recorded with respect to the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements that will result in deductible or taxable amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Our temporary differences relate principally to net operating losses, premium revenue recognition, accrued interest on outstanding surplus notes, insured loss reserves, unrealized gains or losses on investments and insured derivatives and deferred acquisition costs.\nValuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets. Changes in the amount of a valuation allowance are reflected within our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. Determining whether to establish a valuation allowance and, if so, the amount of the valuation allowance requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such tax benefits will be realized in future periods prior to the expiration of the deferred tax assets.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future federal pre-tax income. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses. Actual future taxable income or loss could be significantly different from our projections. In evaluating the objective evidence that recent results provide, we consider the prior three years of cumulative pre-tax comprehensive income (loss). We consider a trend of comprehensive income to be positive evidence of our ability to recover our net deferred tax asset and a trend of comprehensive losses to be negative evidence.\nDuring 2017, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset.

The increase in OTTI related to several impaired securities for which a loss was recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $683 million and $220 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured first-lien residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d).\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes increased for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset. Refer to the following \u201cTaxes\u201d section and \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe decrease in consolidated total revenues was primarily due to an impairment loss related to the sale of MBIA UK, a decrease in net gains on insured derivatives and lower net premiums earned due to higher refunding activity in 2015. Net losses on insured derivatives in 2016 were primarily the result of claim payments on commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d) transactions. Net gains on insured derivatives in 2015 were principally the result of changes in transaction-specific factors, such as credit ratings, partially offset by claim payments.\nConsolidated total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $220 million and $123 million, respectively, of net insurance losses and LAE. This increase was principally due to losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures and insured second-lien RMBS transactions, partially offset by decreases in insured collateralized debt obligation (\u201cCDO\u201d) losses.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nIn addition to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also analyze the operating performance of the Company using adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, both non-GAAP measures. Previously, these non-GAAP measures were referred to as combined operating income (loss) and combined operating income (loss) per diluted common share. There was no change to the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. There was only a change to the names of these non-GAAP measures. Since adjusted net income (loss) is used by management to assess performance and make business decisions, we consider adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share fundamental measures of periodic financial performance which are useful in understanding our results. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are not substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted common share determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definitions of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share include the after-tax results of the Company and remove the after-tax results of our international and structured finance insurance segment, which is not part of our ongoing business strategy, as well as the following:\n \u2022 Elimination of the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments that primarily include interest rate swaps and hybrid financial instruments. Also eliminated are the mark-to-market gains (losses) on warrants issued by the Company. All of these amounts fluctuate based on market interest rates, credit spreads, MBIA Inc.'s common stock price and other market factors. \n \u2022 Elimination of foreign exchange gains (losses) on the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies. Given the possibility of volatility in foreign exchange markets, we exclude the impact of foreign exchange gains (losses) to provide a measurement of comparability of adjusted net income (loss). \n \u2022 Elimination of gains (losses) on the sale of investments, net investment losses related to OTTI and net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt since the timing of these transactions are subject to management's assessment of market opportunities and capital liquidity positions. \n \u2022 Elimination of the tax provision as a result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax asset in 2017. \nThe following table presents our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share and provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions, except share and per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,605) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: adjusted net income adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes of our international and structured finance insurance segment and eliminations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(185) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(475) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to income before income taxes of our U.S. public finance insurance and corporate segments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange gains (losses)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains (losses) on sales of investments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment losses related to OTTI\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other net realized gains (losses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income adjustment to the (provision) benefit for income tax(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(944) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(410) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.45) </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.52 </td> <td>(4) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nItem 7.

We consider ABV a measure of fundamental value of the Company and the change in ABV an important measure of financial performance. ABV adjusts GAAP book value to remove the legal entity book value of MBIA Corp. In addition, ABV adjusts for certain items which the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value through GAAP earnings and other comprehensive income, as well as add in the impact of certain items which the Company believes will be realized in GAAP book value in future periods. The Company has limited such adjustments to those items that it deems to be important to fundamental value and performance and for which the likelihood and amount can be reasonably estimated. We have presented ABV to allow investors and analysts to evaluate the Company using the same measure that MBIA's management regularly uses to measure financial performance and value. ABV is not a substitute for and should not be viewed in isolation of GAAP book value, and our definition of ABV may differ from that used by other companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ABV per share was $29.32, a decrease from $31.88 as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in ABV per share was primarily driven by the establishment of a full valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax asset and losses incurred on certain Puerto Rico exposures, partially offset by a decrease in common shares outstanding from the share repurchases made by the Company during 2017. The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated book value per share to consolidated ABV per share:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In millions except share and per share amounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total shareholders' equity of MBIA Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,484,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,200,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reverse book value of the MBIA Corp. legal entity(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.07 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value after MBIA Corp. legal entity adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other book value adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reverse net unrealized (gains) losses included in other comprehensive income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add net unearned premium revenue(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add tax effect on unrealized (gains) losses and unearned premium revenue(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.61) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other book value adjustments per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted book value per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)-The book value of the MBIA Corp. legal entity does not provide significant economic or shareholder value to MBIA Inc.\n(2)-Consists of financial guarantee premiums, net of deferred acquisition costs.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nU.S. Public Finance Insurance\nOur U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National. The financial guarantees issued by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due or, in the event National has exercised, at its discretion, the right to accelerate the payment under its policies upon the acceleration of the underlying insured obligations due to default or otherwise. National's guarantees insure municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions, as well as utility districts, airports, healthcare institutions, higher educational facilities, student loan issuers, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, user fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. As of December 31, 2017, National had total insured gross par outstanding of $71.9 billion.\nOn June 26, 2017, S&P downgraded the financial strength rating of National from AA- with a stable outlook to A with a stable outlook. S&P noted that the downgrade of National was based on its view that National had not gained wide market acceptance as demonstrated by its low new business volume. We determined that with the A rating it would be difficult for National to compete with higher-rated competitors, and therefore, we ceased at that time our efforts to actively pursue writing new financial guarantee business. Subsequent to the S&P financial strength rating downgrade, National terminated its agreement for ratings from S&P, Moody's and Kroll.\nNational continues to surveil and remediate its existing insured portfolio and will seek opportunities to enhance shareholder value using its strong financial resources, while protecting the interests of its policyholders. Certain state and local governments and territory obligors that National insures remain under financial and budgetary stress. This could lead to an increase in defaults by such entities on the payment of their obligations and losses or impairments on a greater number of the Company's insured transactions. In particular, Puerto Rico is experiencing significant fiscal stress and constrained liquidity due to, among other things, Puerto Rico's structural budget imbalance, the lack of access to the capital markets, a stagnating local economy, net migration of people out of Puerto Rico and a high debt burden. Although Puerto Rico has tried to address its challenges through various fiscal policies, it continues to experience significant fiscal stress. Also, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane resulting in catastrophic damage to much of the island's basic infrastructure, including its electrical transmission and distribution grid, telecommunications network, housing, roads, bridges, water and sewer systems. On September 21, 2017, the President of the United States approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) made federal disaster assistance available to Puerto Rico to supplement its recovery efforts. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. We continue to monitor and analyze these situations and other stressed credits closely, and the overall extent and duration of this stress is uncertain.\nItem 7.

EARNED Net premiums earned on financial guarantees represent gross premiums earned net of premiums ceded to reinsurers, and include scheduled premium earnings and premium earnings from refunded issues. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2017 compared with 2016 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $41 million and scheduled premiums earned of $21 million. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2016 compared with 2015 resulted from decreases in refunded premiums earned of $42 million and scheduled premiums earned of $26 million. Scheduled premium earnings declined due to the refunding and maturity of insured issues in prior periods. Refunding activity over the past several years has accelerated premium earnings in prior periods and reduced the amount of scheduled premiums that would have been earned in the current period.\nNET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange primarily relate to net realized gains from the sales of securities as a result of favorable market conditions. In 2016, the increase in these net realized gains was primarily due to generating liquidity for anticipated claim payments on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nNET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS Net investment losses related to OTTI for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily related to impaired securities for which losses were recognized as the difference between a security's amortized cost and fair value or recovery value. This OTTI resulted from liquidity concerns, recent credit rating downgrades and other adverse financial conditions of the issuers.\nLOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES National's insured portfolio management group within our U.S. public finance insurance segment is responsible for monitoring our U.S. public finance insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and performance of the insured issue.\nRefer to \u201cNote 6: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's loss reserving policy and additional information related to its loss reserves.\nItem 7.
