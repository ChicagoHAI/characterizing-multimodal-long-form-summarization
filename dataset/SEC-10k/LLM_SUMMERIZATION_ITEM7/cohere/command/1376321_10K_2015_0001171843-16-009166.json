Our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d believe,\u201d or similar language. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nOur company was incorporated in the State of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. From the date of our company's incorporation until June 26, 2009, when our company consummated the Share Exchange (as defined below), our company's activities were primarily concentrated in web server access and company branding in hosting web based e-games.\nOn June 26, 2009, our company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), with (i) China Net Online Media Group Limited, a company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands ( China Net BVI\u201d), (ii) China Net BVI's shareholders, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of China Net BVI (the China Net BVI Shares\u201d) and (iii) G. Edward Hancock, our principal stockholder at such time. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the China Net BVI Shareholders transferred to us all of the China Net BVI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 13,790,800 shares (the Exchange Shares\u201d) in the aggregate of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, China Net BVI became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are now a holding company which, through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d), is engaged in providing advertising, marketing, communication, O2O sales channel expansion and the related data services to SMEs in China.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, China Net BVI, was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on August 13, 2007. On April 11, 2008, China Net BVI became the parent holding company of a group of companies comprised of CNET Online Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company ( China Net HK\u201d), which established, and is the parent company of, Rise King Century Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise ( WFOE\u201d) established in the PRC ( Rise King WFOE\u201d). We refer to the transactions that resulted in China Net BVI becoming an indirect parent company of Rise King WFOE as the Offshore Restructuring.\u201d\nPRC regulations prohibit direct foreign ownership of business entities providing internet content, or ICP services in the PRC, and restrict foreign ownership of business entities engaging in the advertising business. To satisfy PRC laws and regulations, we conduct certain business in the PRC through our Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs\u201d). Through a series of contractual agreements (the Contractual Agreements\u201d or VIE Agreements\u201d) between Rise King WFOE and Business Opportunity Online (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd. ( Business Opportunity Online\u201d), Beijing CNET Online Advertising Co., Ltd. ( Beijing CNET Online\u201d) (collectively the PRC Operating Entities\u201d or the VIEs\u201d) and its common individual owners (the PRC Shareholders\u201d or the Control Group\u201d), we, through Rise King WFOE, secure significant rights to influence the PRC Operating Entities' business operations, policies and management, approve all matters requiring shareholder approval, and the right to receive 100% of the income earned by the PRC Operating Entities. In return, Rise King WFOE provides consulting services to the PRC Operating Entities. In addition, to ensure that the PRC Operating Entities and the PRC Shareholders perform their obligations under the Contractual Arrangements, the PRC Shareholders have pledged all of their equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities to Rise King WFOE. They also entered into an option agreement with Rise King WFOE which provides that at such time as when the current restrictions under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies engaging in the Internet content, information services or advertising business in China are lifted, Rise King WFOE may exercise its option to purchase the equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities, directly.\nPursuant to the Contractual Agreements, all of the equity owners' rights and obligations of the VIEs were assigned to Rise King WFOE, which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the VIEs, Rise King WFOE's ability to extract the profits from the operation of the VIEs and assume the residual benefits of the VIEs. Due to the fact that Rise King WFOE and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the VIEs, we included the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, which is consistent with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 810, Consolidation\u201d subtopic 10.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThrough our PRC operating subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, we primarily operate a one-stop services for our clients through our integrated service platforms, including multi-channel advertising and promotion platform and social networking and services distribution platform. Our multi-channel advertising and promotion platform primarily consists of internet advertising and marketing portals and our TV production and advertising unit. We provide varieties of marketing campaigns through this platform by the combination of the Internet, mobile, and television, we also generate effective sales leads and provide search engine marketing services through this platform to maximize market exposure and effectiveness for our clients. Our social networking and services distribution platform is an information and service portal for entrepreneurs or any individual who plans to start their own business. It is built to serve the community of entrepreneurs to assist them with developing their business, as well as sharing their resources. We also use this platform to develop the distribution channels for our online to offline (O2O) sales channel expansion services in different cities in the PRC. During the past two years, we developed our SMEs intelligent operation and marketing data service applications, which consists of several online cloud technology based sales, client membership management and other administrative operational management tools specifically designed for small business in China to match their simplicity. We intend to use these applications to create community-based consumption ecosystem, deploy our Big Data collection technologies and analyze offline businesses' operational data and customers' consumption data to help the SMEs improve the conversion rate of the purchase from their clients and provide them with related data services..\nBasis of presentation, critical accounting policies and management estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our company, and all of our subsidiaries and VIEs. We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements.\nComparability due to discontinued operation\nWe exited our brand management and sales channel building business segment, which qualified for presentation as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Topic 205 Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d. As a result, the results of operations of this business was reported in discontinued operation as a separate component in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Certain accounts in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of reclassification of results of operations reported in discontinued operation as a separate component.\nCash flows from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each of the three categories.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nOur functional currency is United States dollars ( US$\u201d), and the functional currency of China Net HK is Hong Kong dollars ( HK$\u201d). The functional currency of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs is Renminbi ( RMB'), and PRC is the primary economic environment in which we operate.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into our reporting currency, the United States Dollar ( U.S. dollar\u201d). Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period, and stockholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income/loss of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into US$ for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance sheet items, except for equity accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Items in the statements of income and comprehensive income, and statements of cash flows </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted into US$ at the above rates.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, which include tangible long-lived assets and intangible long-lived assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries.\nGoodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. The test consists of two steps. First, identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. Second, if there is impairment identified in the first step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nAs discussed before, we have committed to a plan to sell liansuo.com, which is a portion of our internet advertising reporting unit that constitutes a business. In accordance with ASC Topic 350: Intangibles-Goodwill and Others\u201d Subtopic 20-40, goodwill associated with that business unit shall be included in the carrying amount of the business to determine the gain or loss on disposal. In accordance with ASC 350-20-40-3 through ASC 350-20-40-7, we first allocated goodwill associated with our internet advertising reporting unit to the carrying value of lianso.com based on the relative fair value of lianso.com and the portion of this reporting unit that will be retained, and then performed goodwill impairment test for goodwill remaining in the portion of the reporting unit to be retained using its adjusted carrying value.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value\nASC Topic 820 \"Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,\" defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.\nWe measure our intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and they are recorded at fair value using income approach only when impairment is recognized. The fair value of intangible assets and goodwill was determined using income approach by utilizing significant level 3 unobservable internally-developed inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the quantitative information of the significant unobservable internally-developed inputs utilized in our level 3 fair value measurement:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation technique(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Unobservable inputs </td> <td> </td> <td>Ranges </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As of December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Multi-period Excess Earning </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining useful life </td> <td> </td> <td>1-7 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline in EBIT without non-compete agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual customer attrition rate </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Discounted Cash Flow </td> <td> </td> <td>Projection year </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As of December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Multi-period Excess Earning </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining useful life </td> <td> </td> <td>1.17-5.17 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4%-26.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline in EBIT without non-compete agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual customer attrition rate </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Discounted Cash Flow </td> <td> </td> <td>Projection year </td> <td> </td> <td>6 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4%-26.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605. In accordance with ASC Topic 605, revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales include revenues from selling advertising time purchased from TV stations, internet advertising space on our website portals and effective sales lead information collected, providing online advertising, marketing and other related value added technical services. Advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided. Pursuant to advertising contracts, we provide advertisement placements in different formats, including but not limited to banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media and content integration in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. Revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and, as such, we consider the services to have been delivered. We treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes. Value added technical services are provided based on two types of contracts: (i) fixed price and (ii) fixed price with minimum performance threshold. For contracts with fixed price term, revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the engaged service period. For fixed price contracts with minimum performance threshold, revenue is recognized when the specified performance criteria is met. Revenue from search engine marketing services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize the revenue on a gross basic, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. Revenues from selling effective sales lead information is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients. Based upon our credit assessments of our clients prior to entering into contracts, we determine if collectability is reasonably assured. In situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from clients, only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\nTaxation\nTable 97: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>Income tax </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe adopt ASC Topic 740 Income taxes\u201d and use liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe adopt ASC Topic 740-10-25-5 through 740-10-25-7 and 740-10-25-13, which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. We did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\ni). We were incorporated in the State of Nevada. Under the current laws of Nevada, we are not subject to state corporate income tax. We became a holding company and do not conduct any substantial operations of our own after the Share Exchange. No provision for federal corporate income tax has been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. We do not provide for U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIEs because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. If undistributed earnings were distributed, foreign tax credits could become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nii). China Net BVI was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d). Under the current laws of the BVI, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net BVI to us, no BVI withholding tax will be imposed.\niii). China Net HK was incorporated in Hong Kong and does not conduct any substantial operations of its own. No provision for Hong Kong profits tax have been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net HK to its sole shareholder, China Net BVI, no Hong Kong withholding tax will be imposed.\niv). Our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, being incorporated in the PRC, are governed by the income tax law of the PRC and are subject to PRC enterprise income tax ( EIT\u201d). The EIT rate of PRC is 25%, which applies to both domestic and foreign invested enterprises.\nTable 99: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In July 2012, Business Opportunity Online was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities as a High and New Technology Enterprise under the current EIT law, and was approved by the local tax authorities of Beijing, the PRC, to be entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until December 31, 2014. During 2015, Business Opportunity Online reapplied for the qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise. In November 2015, Business Opportunity Online received the formal certificate as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which enabled the entity to continue to enjoy the favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until November 2018.

Business Opportunity Online and Business Opportunity Online Hubei were most affected by these preferential income tax treatments within the structure of us. The preferential income tax treatments are subject to change in accordance with the PRC government economic development policies and regulations. These preferential income tax treatments are primarily determined by the regulation and policies of the PRC government in the context of the overall economic policy and strategy. As a result, the uncertainty of theses preferential income tax treatments are subject to, but not limited to, the PRC government policy on supporting any specific industry's development under the outlook and strategy of overall macroeconomic development.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Turnover taxes and the relevant surcharges </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenues provided by our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to Value Added Tax ( VAT\u201d). VAT rate for provision of modern services (other than lease of corporeal movables) is 6% and for small scale taxpayer, 3%. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenues are subject to VAT at a rate of 6%, after deducting the VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers, or at a rate of 3% without any deduction of VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers. The surcharges of the VAT is 12%-14% of the VAT, depending on which tax jurisdiction our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIE operate in.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-01, Income Statement -Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d. This ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The Board concluded that the amendments in this ASU will not result in a loss of information because although the amendments will eliminate the requirements in Subtopic 225-20 for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\u201d. The amendment in this ASU changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Overall, the amendments in this ASU are an improvement to current GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d. The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. ASU No. 2014-09, issued in May 2014, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605-Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of this ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in this ASU to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combination (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, i.e., to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU from January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this ASU require that an entity that has an available-for sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. No additional disclosures are required at transition. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d. The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance. The amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party. An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, which is deferred by ASU No. 2015-14 by one year. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU affected all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nA.\t RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nThe following table sets forth a summary, for the periods indicated, of our consolidated results of operations.

included Internet adverting, TV advertising, Bank kiosk advertising, and Brand management and sales channel building. As discussed, we exited the bank kiosk advertising and brand management and sale channel building segments, of which the brand management and sale channel building segment qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation, which results of operations was presented as loss from discontinued operations as a separate component in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Since the revenue generated from our bank kiosk segment were immaterial, we combined the performance of our bank kiosk segment with our TV advertising segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as presented above.\nTotal Revenues: Excluding revenue generated from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total revenues decreased to US$32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from US$38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 15% decrease. The decrease in our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in our TV advertising revenue during the year.\nWe derive the majority of our advertising service revenues from the sale of advertising space on our internet portals, sales of effective sales lead information, providing search engine marketing ( SEM\u201d) service and other related value added technical support and services and content management services to unrelated third parties and to certain related parties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising time purchased from different provincial satellite TV stations. Our advertising and marketing services to related parties were provided in the ordinary course of business on the same terms as those provided to our unrelated customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenue from related parties in the aggregate was less than 2.5% of the total revenue for each respective reporting period.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>48 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur advertising service revenues are recorded net of any sales discounts. Sales discounts include volume discounts and other customary incentives offered to our small and medium-sized franchise and merchant clients, including providing them with additional advertising time for their advertisements if we have unused space available on our websites and represents the difference between our official list price and the amount we actually charge our clients. For advertising services, we typically sign service contracts with our small and medium-sized franchisor and other clients that require us to place the advertisements on our portal websites in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. We recognize revenues as the advertisement airs over the contractual term based on the schedule agreed upon with our clients. Revenue from SEM services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize this revenue on a gross basis, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. We also sell effective sales lead information to our clients, which is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients.\nThe tables below summarize

In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a net cash outflow from financing activities of approximately US$1.26 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRestricted Net Assets\nAs most of our operations are conducted through our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations and after it has met the PRC requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves. Paid in capital of the PRC subsidiaries and VIEs included in our consolidated net assets are also not distributable for dividend purposes.\nIn accordance with the PRC regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment, a WFOE established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise's PRC statutory accounts. A WFOE is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise's PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. Rise King WFOE is subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits. Additionally, in accordance with the Company Law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide a statutory common reserve of at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has reached 50% of its registered capital based on the enterprise's PRC statutory accounts. A domestic enterprise is also required to provide for a discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the board of directors. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. All of our PRC VIEs are subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>58 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of these PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, net assets restricted in the aggregate, which includes paid-in capital and statutory reserve funds of our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs that are included in our consolidated net assets, was approximately US$6.7 million and US$7.3 million, respectively.\nThe New PRC Enterprise Income Tax ( EIT\u201d) Law, which was effected on January 1, 2008, also imposed a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China, which were exempted under the previous EIT law. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% rate.\nThe ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to us may also be restricted by changes in applicable foreign exchange and other laws and regulations.\nForeign currency exchange regulation in China is primarily governed by the following rules:\nTable 166: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Foreign Exchange Administration Rules (1996), as amended in August 2008, or the Exchange Rules; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrently, under the Administration Rules, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE\u201d) is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises like Rise King WFOE that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to its shareholders may effect payment from their foreign exchange accounts or purchase and pay foreign exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing board resolutions for such profit distribution. Based on their needs, foreign-invested enterprises are permitted to open foreign exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized accounts for capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks.\nAlthough the current Exchange Rules allow the convertibility of Chinese Renminbi into foreign currency for current account items, conversion of Chinese Renminbi into foreign exchange for capital items, such as foreign direct investment, loans or securities, requires the approval of SAFE, which is under the authority of the People's Bank of China. These approvals, however, do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency conversion. We cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for our operations or the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of Chinese Renminbi in the future. Currently, most of our retained earnings are generated in Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use retained earnings generated in Renminbi to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars or fund possible business activities outside China.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were approximately US$22.9 million and US$30.8 million retained earnings in the aggregate, respectively, which were generated by our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs in Renminbi included in our consolidated net assets, aside from US$2.8 million statutory reserve funds as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, that may be affected by increased restrictions on currency exchanges in the future and accordingly may further limit our PRC subsidiaries' or VIEs' ability to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars to us, in addition to the approximately US$6.7 million and US$7.3 million restricted net assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as discussed above.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>59 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nC.\t Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nD.\t Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our company's operating lease commitment as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Office Rental </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>US$('000) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>-2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn May 2015, we entered into a contract to purchase software products related to cloud video management system from an unrelated third party with a total contract amount of RMB9.5 million (approximately US$1.5 million).

OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d believe,\u201d or similar language. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n 37 \nOverview\nOur company was incorporated in the State of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. From the date of our company's incorporation until June 26, 2009, when our company consummated the Share Exchange (as defined below), our company's activities were primarily concentrated in web server access and company branding in hosting web based e-games.\nOn June 26, 2009, our company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), with (i) China Net Online Media Group Limited, a company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands ( China Net BVI\u201d), (ii) China Net BVI's shareholders, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of China Net BVI (the China Net BVI Shares\u201d) and (iii) G. Edward Hancock, our principal stockholder at such time. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the China Net BVI Shareholders transferred to us all of the China Net BVI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 13,790,800 shares (the Exchange Shares\u201d) in the aggregate of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, China Net BVI became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are now a holding company which, through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d), is engaged in providing advertising, marketing, communication, O2O sales channel expansion and the related data services to SMEs in China.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, China Net BVI, was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on August 13, 2007. On April 11, 2008, China Net BVI became the parent holding company of a group of companies comprised of CNET Online Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company ( China Net HK\u201d), which established, and is the parent company of, Rise King Century Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise ( WFOE\u201d) established in the PRC ( Rise King WFOE\u201d). We refer to the transactions that resulted in China Net BVI becoming an indirect parent company of Rise King WFOE as the Offshore Restructuring.\u201d\nPRC regulations prohibit direct foreign ownership of business entities providing internet content, or ICP services in the PRC, and restrict foreign ownership of business entities engaging in the advertising business. To satisfy PRC laws and regulations, we conduct certain business in the PRC through our Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs\u201d). Through a series of contractual agreements (the Contractual Agreements\u201d or VIE Agreements\u201d) between Rise King WFOE and Business Opportunity Online (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd. ( Business Opportunity Online\u201d), Beijing CNET Online Advertising Co., Ltd. ( Beijing CNET Online\u201d) (collectively the PRC Operating Entities\u201d or the VIEs\u201d) and its common individual owners (the PRC Shareholders\u201d or the Control Group\u201d), we, through Rise King WFOE, secure significant rights to influence the PRC Operating Entities' business operations, policies and management, approve all matters requiring shareholder approval, and the right to receive 100% of the income earned by the PRC Operating Entities. In return, Rise King WFOE provides consulting services to the PRC Operating Entities. In addition, to ensure that the PRC Operating Entities and the PRC Shareholders perform their obligations under the Contractual Arrangements, the PRC Shareholders have pledged all of their equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities to Rise King WFOE. They also entered into an option agreement with Rise King WFOE which provides that at such time as when the current restrictions under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies engaging in the Internet content, information services or advertising business in China are lifted, Rise King WFOE may exercise its option to purchase the equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities, directly.\nPursuant to the Contractual Agreements, all of the equity owners' rights and obligations of the VIEs were assigned to Rise King WFOE, which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the VIEs, Rise King WFOE's ability to extract the profits from the operation of the VIEs and assume the residual benefits of the VIEs. Due to the fact that Rise King WFOE and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the VIEs, we included the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, which is consistent with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 810, Consolidation\u201d subtopic 10.\n 38 \nThrough our PRC operating subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, we primarily operate a one-stop services for our clients through our integrated service platforms, including multi-channel advertising and promotion platform and social networking and services distribution platform. Our multi-channel advertising and promotion platform primarily consists of internet advertising and marketing portals and our TV production and advertising unit. We provide varieties of marketing campaigns through this platform by the combination of the Internet, mobile, and television, we also generate effective sales leads and provide search engine marketing services through this platform to maximize market exposure and effectiveness for our clients. Our social networking and services distribution platform is an information and service portal for entrepreneurs or any individual who plans to start their own business. It is built to serve the community of entrepreneurs to assist them with developing their business, as well as sharing their resources. We also use this platform to develop the distribution channels for our online to offline (O2O) sales channel expansion services in different cities in the PRC. During the past two years, we developed our SMEs intelligent operation and marketing data service applications, which consists of several online cloud technology based sales, client membership management and other administrative operational management tools specifically designed for small business in China to match their simplicity. We intend to use these applications to create community-based consumption ecosystem, deploy our Big Data collection technologies and analyze offline businesses' operational data and customers' consumption data to help the SMEs improve the conversion rate of the purchase from their clients and provide them with related data services..\nBasis of presentation, critical accounting policies and management estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our company, and all of our subsidiaries and VIEs. We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements.\nComparability due to discontinued operation\nWe exited our brand management and sales channel building business segment, which qualified for presentation as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Topic 205 Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d. As a result, the results of operations of this business was reported in discontinued operation as a separate component in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Certain accounts in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of reclassification of results of operations reported in discontinued operation as a separate component.\nCash flows from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each of the three categories.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nOur functional currency is United States dollars ( US$\u201d), and the functional currency of China Net HK is Hong Kong dollars ( HK$\u201d). The functional currency of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs is Renminbi ( RMB'), and PRC is the primary economic environment in which we operate.\n 39 \nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into our reporting currency, the United States Dollar ( U.S. dollar\u201d). Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period, and stockholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income/loss of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into US$ for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\n\n\nNo representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted into US$ at the above rates.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, which include tangible long-lived assets and intangible long-lived assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries.\nGoodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. The test consists of two steps. First, identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. Second, if there is impairment identified in the first step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nAs discussed before, we have committed to a plan to sell liansuo.com, which is a portion of our internet advertising reporting unit that constitutes a business. In accordance with ASC Topic 350: Intangibles-Goodwill and Others\u201d Subtopic 20-40, goodwill associated with that business unit shall be included in the carrying amount of the business to determine the gain or loss on disposal. In accordance with ASC 350-20-40-3 through ASC 350-20-40-7, we first allocated goodwill associated with our internet advertising reporting unit to the carrying value of lianso.com based on the relative fair value of lianso.com and the portion of this reporting unit that will be retained, and then performed goodwill impairment test for goodwill remaining in the portion of the reporting unit to be retained using its adjusted carrying value.\n 40 \nFair Value\nASC Topic 820 \"Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,\" defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.\nWe measure our intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and they are recorded at fair value using income approach only when impairment is recognized. The fair value of intangible assets and goodwill was determined using income approach by utilizing significant level 3 unobservable internally-developed inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the quantitative information of the significant unobservable internally-developed inputs utilized in our level 3 fair value measurement:\n\n 41 \nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605. In accordance with ASC Topic 605, revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales include revenues from selling advertising time purchased from TV stations, internet advertising space on our website portals and effective sales lead information collected, providing online advertising, marketing and other related value added technical services. Advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided. Pursuant to advertising contracts, we provide advertisement placements in different formats, including but not limited to banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media and content integration in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. Revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and, as such, we consider the services to have been delivered. We treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes. Value added technical services are provided based on two types of contracts: (i) fixed price and (ii) fixed price with minimum performance threshold. For contracts with fixed price term, revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the engaged service period. For fixed price contracts with minimum performance threshold, revenue is recognized when the specified performance criteria is met. Revenue from search engine marketing services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize the revenue on a gross basic, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. Revenues from selling effective sales lead information is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients. Based upon our credit assessments of our clients prior to entering into contracts, we determine if collectability is reasonably assured. In situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from clients, only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\nTaxation\n 1. Income tax \nWe adopt ASC Topic 740 Income taxes\u201d and use liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe adopt ASC Topic 740-10-25-5 through 740-10-25-7 and 740-10-25-13, which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. We did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\ni). We were incorporated in the State of Nevada. Under the current laws of Nevada, we are not subject to state corporate income tax. We became a holding company and do not conduct any substantial operations of our own after the Share Exchange. No provision for federal corporate income tax has been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. We do not provide for U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIEs because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. If undistributed earnings were distributed, foreign tax credits could become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\n 42 \nii). China Net BVI was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d). Under the current laws of the BVI, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net BVI to us, no BVI withholding tax will be imposed.\niii). China Net HK was incorporated in Hong Kong and does not conduct any substantial operations of its own. No provision for Hong Kong profits tax have been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net HK to its sole shareholder, China Net BVI, no Hong Kong withholding tax will be imposed.\niv). Our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, being incorporated in the PRC, are governed by the income tax law of the PRC and are subject to PRC enterprise income tax ( EIT\u201d). The EIT rate of PRC is 25%, which applies to both domestic and foreign invested enterprises.\n \u00b7 In July 2012, Business Opportunity Online was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities as a High and New Technology Enterprise under the current EIT law, and was approved by the local tax authorities of Beijing, the PRC, to be entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until December 31, 2014. During 2015, Business Opportunity Online reapplied for the qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise. In November 2015, Business Opportunity Online received the formal certificate as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which enabled the entity to continue to enjoy the favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until November 2018. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the applicable income tax rate of Business Opportunity Online was both 15%. \n \u00b7 Business Opportunity Online Hubei was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities to be qualified as a software company and was approved by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province, the PRC, to be entitled to a EIT exemption for fiscal 2012 and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate which is 25% to 12.5% of its taxable income for the succeeding three years through fiscal 2015, as its first profitable year was determined as fiscal 2011 instead of fiscal 2012 in August 2013 by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province. Therefore, the applicable income tax rate for Business Opportunity Online Hubei was both 12.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. After fiscal 2015, the applicable income tax rate for Business Opportunity Online Hubei will be 25% under the current EIT law of PRC. \n \u00b7 The applicable income tax rate for the rest of our PRC operating entities was 25% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. \n \u00b7 The current EIT law also imposed a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the preferential income tax treatments enjoyed by our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs were based on the current applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and approved by the related government regulatory authorities and local tax authorities where our respective PRC subsidiaries and VIEs operate in. Business Opportunity Online and Business Opportunity Online Hubei were most affected by these preferential income tax treatments within the structure of us. The preferential income tax treatments are subject to change in accordance with the PRC government economic development policies and regulations. These preferential income tax treatments are primarily determined by the regulation and policies of the PRC government in the context of the overall economic policy and strategy. As a result, the uncertainty of theses preferential income tax treatments are subject to, but not limited to, the PRC government policy on supporting any specific industry's development under the outlook and strategy of overall macroeconomic development.\n 43 \n 2. Turnover taxes and the relevant surcharges \nService revenues provided by our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to Value Added Tax ( VAT\u201d). VAT rate for provision of modern services (other than lease of corporeal movables) is 6% and for small scale taxpayer, 3%. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenues are subject to VAT at a rate of 6%, after deducting the VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers, or at a rate of 3% without any deduction of VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers. The surcharges of the VAT is 12%-14% of the VAT, depending on which tax jurisdiction our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIE operate in.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-01, Income Statement -Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d. This ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The Board concluded that the amendments in this ASU will not result in a loss of information because although the amendments will eliminate the requirements in Subtopic 225-20 for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\u201d. The amendment in this ASU changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Overall, the amendments in this ASU are an improvement to current GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d. The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. ASU No. 2014-09, issued in May 2014, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605-Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of this ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in this ASU to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\n 44 \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combination (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, i.e., to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU from January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n 45 \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this ASU require that an entity that has an available-for sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. No additional disclosures are required at transition. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d. The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance. The amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party. An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, which is deferred by ASU No. 2015-14 by one year. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU affected all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\n 46 \nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nA.\t RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nThe following table sets forth a summary, for the periods indicated, of our consolidated results of operations. Our historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. All amounts, except number of shares and per share data, are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars.\n\n 47 \nREVENUES\nThe following tables set forth a breakdown of our total revenues, divided into five segments for the periods indicated, with inter-segment transactions eliminated:\n\n* Previously, we had four reportable operating segments, which included Internet adverting, TV advertising, Bank kiosk advertising, and Brand management and sales channel building. As discussed, we exited the bank kiosk advertising and brand management and sale channel building segments, of which the brand management and sale channel building segment qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation, which results of operations was presented as loss from discontinued operations as a separate component in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Since the revenue generated from our bank kiosk segment were immaterial, we combined the performance of our bank kiosk segment with our TV advertising segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as presented above.\nTotal Revenues: Excluding revenue generated from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total revenues decreased to US$32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from US$38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 15% decrease. The decrease in our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in our TV advertising revenue during the year.\nWe derive the majority of our advertising service revenues from the sale of advertising space on our internet portals, sales of effective sales lead information, providing search engine marketing ( SEM\u201d) service and other related value added technical support and services and content management services to unrelated third parties and to certain related parties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising time purchased from different provincial satellite TV stations. Our advertising and marketing services to related parties were provided in the ordinary course of business on the same terms as those provided to our unrelated customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenue from related parties in the aggregate was less than 2.5% of the total revenue for each respective reporting period.\n 48 \nOur advertising service revenues are recorded net of any sales discounts. Sales discounts include volume discounts and other customary incentives offered to our small and medium-sized franchise and merchant clients, including providing them with additional advertising time for their advertisements if we have unused space available on our websites and represents the difference between our official list price and the amount we actually charge our clients. For advertising services, we typically sign service contracts with our small and medium-sized franchisor and other clients that require us to place the advertisements on our portal websites in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. We recognize revenues as the advertisement airs over the contractual term based on the schedule agreed upon with our clients. Revenue from SEM services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize this revenue on a gross basis, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. We also sell effective sales lead information to our clients, which is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients.\nThe tables below summarize the revenues, cost of revenues, gross profit and net loss generated from each of our VIEs and subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with inter-company transactions eliminated:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\n 49 \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014:\n\nManagement considers revenues generated from internet advertising, SEM services and other related technical services as one aggregate business operation and relies upon the consolidated results of all the operations in this business unit to make decisions about allocating resources and evaluating performance.\n \u00b7 Internet advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately US$19.60 million, compared to US$17.6 million for the same period in 2014, represents a 11% increase. During 2015, we continued to place persistent effort in integrating and upgrading our internet advertising and marketing services to our SME clients. As a result, starting from the second fiscal quarter of 2015, the performance of our internet advertising segment improved. Along with eliminating smaller and non-profitable clients, the number of larger customers served by us continued to increase, and our client's average consumption amount for our internet advertising services also increased as compare with that in the same period of last year, which led the increase in our internet advertising revenue for 2015. We will continue to invest in developing new service modules for our clients. We believe that launch of new services in future periods will help to increase our market penetration in the SME segment, thereby continue to increasing our recurring revenues in the future. \n \u00b7 Revenues generated from technical services offered by Rise King WFOE were US$0.36 million and US$0.73 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was insignificant for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. \n \u00b7 Revenue generated from search engine marketing services for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately US$11.1 million and US$12.9 million, respectively. This enhanced third-party search engine marketing service is designed to help our clients select the most effective key words and to prioritize the ranking of the anticipated search engine results on selected key words in order to increase the sales lead conversion rate for our clients' business promotion on both mobile and PC searches. Management believes this service will be an effective supplement to the internet advertising services provided to our clients, and will help increase the overall satisfaction on our services, thereby increasing recurring revenues and number of clients from online advertising and marketing in the future. \n 50 \n \u00b7 For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenues generated from our TV and bank kiosk advertising business was US$1.25 million and US$6.71 million, respectively. Our TV advertising revenue decreased to US$1.09 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from US$6.43 million for the same period in 2014. Due to the adoption of a restriction notice to TV shopping infomercials broadcasted in provincial satellite television station, issued by the SARFT in October 2013, which further restricts the content, air time and duration of these infomercials, the demand of TV advertising service from our clients decreased accordingly. We will continue to monitor our clients' needs of the TV advertising services and improve the profitability of this business segment in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues from our bank kiosk advertising was approximately US$0.16 million and US$0.28 million, respectively. It was not a significant contributor to revenue for both the years ended", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n 37 \nOverview\nOur company was incorporated in the State of Texas in April 2006 and re-domiciled to become a Nevada corporation in October 2006. From the date of our company's incorporation until June 26, 2009, when our company consummated the Share Exchange (as defined below), our company's activities were primarily concentrated in web server access and company branding in hosting web based e-games.\nOn June 26, 2009, our company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), with (i) China Net Online Media Group Limited, a company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands ( China Net BVI\u201d), (ii) China Net BVI's shareholders, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of China Net BVI (the China Net BVI Shares\u201d) and (iii) G. Edward Hancock, our principal stockholder at such time. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the China Net BVI Shareholders transferred to us all of the China Net BVI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 13,790,800 shares (the Exchange Shares\u201d) in the aggregate of our common stock (the Share Exchange\u201d). As a result of the Share Exchange, China Net BVI became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are now a holding company which, through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d), is engaged in providing advertising, marketing, communication, O2O sales channel expansion and the related data services to SMEs in China.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, China Net BVI, was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on August 13, 2007. On April 11, 2008, China Net BVI became the parent holding company of a group of companies comprised of CNET Online Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company ( China Net HK\u201d), which established, and is the parent company of, Rise King Century Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise ( WFOE\u201d) established in the PRC ( Rise King WFOE\u201d). We refer to the transactions that resulted in China Net BVI becoming an indirect parent company of Rise King WFOE as the Offshore Restructuring.\u201d\nPRC regulations prohibit direct foreign ownership of business entities providing internet content, or ICP services in the PRC, and restrict foreign ownership of business entities engaging in the advertising business. To satisfy PRC laws and regulations, we conduct certain business in the PRC through our Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs\u201d). Through a series of contractual agreements (the Contractual Agreements\u201d or VIE Agreements\u201d) between Rise King WFOE and Business Opportunity Online (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd. ( Business Opportunity Online\u201d), Beijing CNET Online Advertising Co., Ltd. ( Beijing CNET Online\u201d) (collectively the PRC Operating Entities\u201d or the VIEs\u201d) and its common individual owners (the PRC Shareholders\u201d or the Control Group\u201d), we, through Rise King WFOE, secure significant rights to influence the PRC Operating Entities' business operations, policies and management, approve all matters requiring shareholder approval, and the right to receive 100% of the income earned by the PRC Operating Entities. In return, Rise King WFOE provides consulting services to the PRC Operating Entities. In addition, to ensure that the PRC Operating Entities and the PRC Shareholders perform their obligations under the Contractual Arrangements, the PRC Shareholders have pledged all of their equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities to Rise King WFOE. They also entered into an option agreement with Rise King WFOE which provides that at such time as when the current restrictions under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies engaging in the Internet content, information services or advertising business in China are lifted, Rise King WFOE may exercise its option to purchase the equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities, directly.\nPursuant to the Contractual Agreements, all of the equity owners' rights and obligations of the VIEs were assigned to Rise King WFOE, which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the VIEs, Rise King WFOE's ability to extract the profits from the operation of the VIEs and assume the residual benefits of the VIEs. Due to the fact that Rise King WFOE and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the VIEs, we included the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, which is consistent with the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 810, Consolidation\u201d subtopic 10.\n 38 \nThrough our PRC operating subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs' subsidiaries, we primarily operate a one-stop services for our clients through our integrated service platforms, including multi-channel advertising and promotion platform and social networking and services distribution platform. Our multi-channel advertising and promotion platform primarily consists of internet advertising and marketing portals and our TV production and advertising unit. We provide varieties of marketing campaigns through this platform by the combination of the Internet, mobile, and television, we also generate effective sales leads and provide search engine marketing services through this platform to maximize market exposure and effectiveness for our clients. Our social networking and services distribution platform is an information and service portal for entrepreneurs or any individual who plans to start their own business. It is built to serve the community of entrepreneurs to assist them with developing their business, as well as sharing their resources. We also use this platform to develop the distribution channels for our online to offline (O2O) sales channel expansion services in different cities in the PRC. During the past two years, we developed our SMEs intelligent operation and marketing data service applications, which consists of several online cloud technology based sales, client membership management and other administrative operational management tools specifically designed for small business in China to match their simplicity. We intend to use these applications to create community-based consumption ecosystem, deploy our Big Data collection technologies and analyze offline businesses' operational data and customers' consumption data to help the SMEs improve the conversion rate of the purchase from their clients and provide them with related data services..\nBasis of presentation, critical accounting policies and management estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our company, and all of our subsidiaries and VIEs. We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements.\nComparability due to discontinued operation\nWe exited our brand management and sales channel building business segment, which qualified for presentation as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Topic 205 Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d. As a result, the results of operations of this business was reported in discontinued operation as a separate component in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Certain accounts in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of reclassification of results of operations reported in discontinued operation as a separate component.\nCash flows from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each of the three categories.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nOur functional currency is United States dollars ( US$\u201d), and the functional currency of China Net HK is Hong Kong dollars ( HK$\u201d). The functional currency of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs is Renminbi ( RMB'), and PRC is the primary economic environment in which we operate.\n 39 \nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into our reporting currency, the United States Dollar ( U.S. dollar\u201d). Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period, and stockholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income/loss of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into US$ for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance sheet items, except for equity accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Items in the statements of income and comprehensive income, and statements of cash flows </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted into US$ at the above rates.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, which include tangible long-lived assets and intangible long-lived assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries.\nGoodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. The test consists of two steps. First, identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. Second, if there is impairment identified in the first step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d\nApplication of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nAs discussed before, we have committed to a plan to sell liansuo.com, which is a portion of our internet advertising reporting unit that constitutes a business. In accordance with ASC Topic 350: Intangibles-Goodwill and Others\u201d Subtopic 20-40, goodwill associated with that business unit shall be included in the carrying amount of the business to determine the gain or loss on disposal. In accordance with ASC 350-20-40-3 through ASC 350-20-40-7, we first allocated goodwill associated with our internet advertising reporting unit to the carrying value of lianso.com based on the relative fair value of lianso.com and the portion of this reporting unit that will be retained, and then performed goodwill impairment test for goodwill remaining in the portion of the reporting unit to be retained using its adjusted carrying value.\n 40 \nFair Value\nASC Topic 820 \"Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures,\" defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.\nWe measure our intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and they are recorded at fair value using income approach only when impairment is recognized. The fair value of intangible assets and goodwill was determined using income approach by utilizing significant level 3 unobservable internally-developed inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the quantitative information of the significant unobservable internally-developed inputs utilized in our level 3 fair value measurement:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation technique(s) </td> <td> </td> <td>Unobservable inputs </td> <td> </td> <td>Ranges </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As of December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Multi-period Excess Earning </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining useful life </td> <td> </td> <td>1-7 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline in EBIT without non-compete agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual customer attrition rate </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Discounted Cash Flow </td> <td> </td> <td>Projection year </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>As of December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Multi-period Excess Earning </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining useful life </td> <td> </td> <td>1.17-5.17 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4%-26.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decline in EBIT without non-compete agreement </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual customer attrition rate </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td>Discounted Cash Flow </td> <td> </td> <td>Projection year </td> <td> </td> <td>6 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4%-26.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 41 \nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605. In accordance with ASC Topic 605, revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales include revenues from selling advertising time purchased from TV stations, internet advertising space on our website portals and effective sales lead information collected, providing online advertising, marketing and other related value added technical services. Advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided. Pursuant to advertising contracts, we provide advertisement placements in different formats, including but not limited to banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media and content integration in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. Revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and, as such, we consider the services to have been delivered. We treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes. Value added technical services are provided based on two types of contracts: (i) fixed price and (ii) fixed price with minimum performance threshold. For contracts with fixed price term, revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the engaged service period. For fixed price contracts with minimum performance threshold, revenue is recognized when the specified performance criteria is met. Revenue from search engine marketing services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize the revenue on a gross basic, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. Revenues from selling effective sales lead information is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients. Based upon our credit assessments of our clients prior to entering into contracts, we determine if collectability is reasonably assured. In situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from clients, only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\nTaxation\n 1. Income tax \nWe adopt ASC Topic 740 Income taxes\u201d and use liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe adopt ASC Topic 740-10-25-5 through 740-10-25-7 and 740-10-25-13, which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. We did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\ni). We were incorporated in the State of Nevada. Under the current laws of Nevada, we are not subject to state corporate income tax. We became a holding company and do not conduct any substantial operations of our own after the Share Exchange. No provision for federal corporate income tax has been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. We do not provide for U.S. taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries and VIEs because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. If undistributed earnings were distributed, foreign tax credits could become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\n 42 \nii). China Net BVI was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d). Under the current laws of the BVI, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net BVI to us, no BVI withholding tax will be imposed.\niii). China Net HK was incorporated in Hong Kong and does not conduct any substantial operations of its own. No provision for Hong Kong profits tax have been made in our financial statements as no assessable profits for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any prior periods. Additionally, upon payments of dividends by China Net HK to its sole shareholder, China Net BVI, no Hong Kong withholding tax will be imposed.\niv). Our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs, being incorporated in the PRC, are governed by the income tax law of the PRC and are subject to PRC enterprise income tax ( EIT\u201d). The EIT rate of PRC is 25%, which applies to both domestic and foreign invested enterprises.\n \u00b7 In July 2012, Business Opportunity Online was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities as a High and New Technology Enterprise under the current EIT law, and was approved by the local tax authorities of Beijing, the PRC, to be entitled to a favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until December 31, 2014. During 2015, Business Opportunity Online reapplied for the qualification as a High and New Technology Enterprise. In November 2015, Business Opportunity Online received the formal certificate as a High and New Technology Enterprise, which enabled the entity to continue to enjoy the favorable statutory tax rate of 15% until November 2018. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the applicable income tax rate of Business Opportunity Online was both 15%. \n \u00b7 Business Opportunity Online Hubei was approved by the related PRC governmental authorities to be qualified as a software company and was approved by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province, the PRC, to be entitled to a EIT exemption for fiscal 2012 and a 50% reduction of its applicable EIT rate which is 25% to 12.5% of its taxable income for the succeeding three years through fiscal 2015, as its first profitable year was determined as fiscal 2011 instead of fiscal 2012 in August 2013 by the local tax authorities of Xiaogan City, Hubei province. Therefore, the applicable income tax rate for Business Opportunity Online Hubei was both 12.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. After fiscal 2015, the applicable income tax rate for Business Opportunity Online Hubei will be 25% under the current EIT law of PRC. \n \u00b7 The applicable income tax rate for the rest of our PRC operating entities was 25% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. \n \u00b7 The current EIT law also imposed a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Holding companies in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the preferential income tax treatments enjoyed by our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs were based on the current applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and approved by the related government regulatory authorities and local tax authorities where our respective PRC subsidiaries and VIEs operate in. Business Opportunity Online and Business Opportunity Online Hubei were most affected by these preferential income tax treatments within the structure of us. The preferential income tax treatments are subject to change in accordance with the PRC government economic development policies and regulations. These preferential income tax treatments are primarily determined by the regulation and policies of the PRC government in the context of the overall economic policy and strategy. As a result, the uncertainty of theses preferential income tax treatments are subject to, but not limited to, the PRC government policy on supporting any specific industry's development under the outlook and strategy of overall macroeconomic development.\n 43 \n 2. Turnover taxes and the relevant surcharges \nService revenues provided by our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to Value Added Tax ( VAT\u201d). VAT rate for provision of modern services (other than lease of corporeal movables) is 6% and for small scale taxpayer, 3%. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenues are subject to VAT at a rate of 6%, after deducting the VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers, or at a rate of 3% without any deduction of VAT paid for the services purchased from suppliers. The surcharges of the VAT is 12%-14% of the VAT, depending on which tax jurisdiction our PRC operating subsidiaries and VIE operate in.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2015-01, Income Statement -Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d. This ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The Board concluded that the amendments in this ASU will not result in a loss of information because although the amendments will eliminate the requirements in Subtopic 225-20 for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\u201d. The amendment in this ASU changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Overall, the amendments in this ASU are an improvement to current GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d. The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. ASU No. 2014-09, issued in May 2014, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605-Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of this ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in this ASU to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\n 44 \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combination (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments\u201d. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, i.e., to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU from January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n 45 \nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this ASU require that an entity that has an available-for sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. No additional disclosures are required at transition. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\u201d. The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance. The amendments clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party. An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, which is deferred by ASU No. 2015-14 by one year. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. The amendments in this ASU affected all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adopting these amendments.\n 46 \nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nA.\t RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nThe following table sets forth a summary, for the periods indicated, of our consolidated results of operations.

adverting, TV advertising, Bank kiosk advertising, and Brand management and sales channel building. As discussed, we exited the bank kiosk advertising and brand management and sale channel building segments, of which the brand management and sale channel building segment qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation, which results of operations was presented as loss from discontinued operations as a separate component in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Since the revenue generated from our bank kiosk segment were immaterial, we combined the performance of our bank kiosk segment with our TV advertising segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as presented above.\nTotal Revenues: Excluding revenue generated from discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total revenues decreased to US$32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from US$38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which represents a 15% decrease. The decrease in our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in our TV advertising revenue during the year.\nWe derive the majority of our advertising service revenues from the sale of advertising space on our internet portals, sales of effective sales lead information, providing search engine marketing ( SEM\u201d) service and other related value added technical support and services and content management services to unrelated third parties and to certain related parties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising time purchased from different provincial satellite TV stations. Our advertising and marketing services to related parties were provided in the ordinary course of business on the same terms as those provided to our unrelated customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our service revenue from related parties in the aggregate was less than 2.5% of the total revenue for each respective reporting period.\n 48 \nOur advertising service revenues are recorded net of any sales discounts. Sales discounts include volume discounts and other customary incentives offered to our small and medium-sized franchise and merchant clients, including providing them with additional advertising time for their advertisements if we have unused space available on our websites and represents the difference between our official list price and the amount we actually charge our clients. For advertising services, we typically sign service contracts with our small and medium-sized franchisor and other clients that require us to place the advertisements on our portal websites in specified locations on the sites and for agreed periods; and/or place the advertisements onto our purchased advertisement time during specific TV programs for agreed periods. We recognize revenues as the advertisement airs over the contractual term based on the schedule agreed upon with our clients. Revenue from SEM services is recognized on a monthly basis based on the direct cost consumed through search engines for providing such services with a premium. We recognize this revenue on a gross basis, as we believe that we act as the primary obligor of this transaction, which is considered the most important factor for a gross revenue recognition in accordance with ASC Topic 605, subtopic 45. We also sell effective sales lead information to our clients, which is recognized based on fixed price per sales lead when information is delivered and accepted by clients.\nThe tables below summarize the revenues, cost of revenues, gross profit and net loss generated from each of our VIEs and subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with inter-company transactions

internet advertising, SEM services and other related technical services as one aggregate business operation and relies upon the consolidated results of all the operations in this business unit to make decisions about allocating resources and evaluating performance.\n \u00b7 Internet advertising revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately US$19.60 million, compared to US$17.6 million for the same period in 2014, represents a 11% increase. During 2015, we continued to place persistent effort in integrating and upgrading our internet advertising and marketing services to our SME clients. As a result, starting from the second fiscal quarter of 2015, the performance of our internet advertising segment improved. Along with eliminating smaller and non-profitable clients, the number of larger customers served by us continued to increase, and our client's average consumption amount for our internet advertising services also increased as compare with that in the same period of last year, which led the increase in our internet advertising revenue for 2015. We will continue to invest in developing new service modules for our clients. We believe that launch of new services in future periods will help to increase our market penetration in the SME segment, thereby continue to increasing our recurring revenues in the future. \n \u00b7 Revenues generated from technical services offered by Rise King WFOE were US$0.36 million and US$0.73 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was insignificant for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. \n \u00b7 Revenue generated from search engine marketing services for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately US$11.1 million and US$12.9 million, respectively. This enhanced third-party search engine marketing service is designed to help our clients select the most effective key words and to prioritize the ranking of the anticipated search engine results on selected key words in order to increase the sales lead conversion rate for our clients' business promotion on both mobile and PC searches. Management believes this service will be an effective supplement to the internet advertising services provided to our clients, and will help increase the overall satisfaction on our services, thereby increasing recurring revenues and number of clients from online advertising and marketing in the future. \n 50 \n \u00b7 For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenues generated from our TV and bank kiosk advertising business was US$1.25 million and US$6.71 million, respectively. Our TV advertising revenue decreased to US$1.09 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from US$6.43 million for the same period in 2014. Due to the adoption of a restriction notice to TV shopping infomercials broadcasted in provincial satellite television station, issued by the SARFT in October 2013, which further restricts the content, air time and duration of these infomercials, the demand of TV advertising service from our clients decreased accordingly. We will continue to monitor our clients' needs of the TV advertising services and improve the profitability of this business segment in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues from our bank kiosk advertising was approximately US$0.16 million and US$0.28 million, respectively. It was not a significant contributor to revenue for both the years ended"}
