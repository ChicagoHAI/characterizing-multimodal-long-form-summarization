MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion should be read together with the Summary Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial data included in this document. In addition to the historical information provided below, we have made certain estimates and forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the section of this document captioned Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d HBI,\u201d us,\u201d we\u201d and our\u201d refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis.\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank ( Centennial\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $16.40 billion, loans receivable, net of $10.98 billion, total deposits of $12.73 billion, and stockholders' equity of $2.61 billion.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and FHLB borrowed funds are our primary source of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our net interest margin, return on average assets and return on average common equity. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP). The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain items such as merger expenses, hurricane expenses and/or gains and losses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of or for the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,398,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,032,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,302,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,220,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,869,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,071,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (245,473\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,725,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,278,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,899,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,605,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,511,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,349,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.02\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 Overview\nRecent Developments - COVID-19\nThe rapid spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) hit the United States during the first quarter of 2020 and has continued through December 31, 2020. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These actions have had a significant impact on markets driven by supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions, retail closures, and reduced consumer spending and sentiment, amongst other factors. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.\nWhile our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that have been deemed, or who are employed by businesses that have been deemed, to be non-essential. Further, many of our customers that have been categorized to date as essential businesses, or who are employed by businesses that have been categorized as essential businesses, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. We have reopened our banking lobbies in order to serve customers in person, while still offering service through drive-thru tellers as well as electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we continue to support working remotely. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments for certain consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our loan deferrals decreased to $330.7 million on 56 loans from the June 30, 2020 balance of $3.18 billion on 4,209 loans. Of the 56 loans currently on deferment, 51 of our loans totaling $271.1 million chose interest only deferment and now have returned to paying interest monthly, with the majority of these loans having modifications for 18-24 month interest only payments with a return to full principal and interest payments at the end of the modification term. The hospitality sector has been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and represents 52.0% of the deferment balance as of December 31, 2020. The geographic distribution of these deferrals is similar through all of our markets. Our review of deferment requests required updated interim operating statements, balance sheet and liquidity verifications, and validation of the current risk rating.\nIn April 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES\u201d Act) established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses. During 2020, as a participating lender, we have generated 8,702 loans to both existing and new customers. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding PPP loan balances were $691.7 million. The average loan size is $88,000.\nWe also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Our stock price has historically traded above its per share book value and tangible book value (non-GAAP). However, at certain times during 2020, our stock price fell below book value. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. During 2020, our common stock traded as low as $9.71 per share; however, our common stock closed on December 31, 2020 at $19.48 per share, which was above book value of $15.78 per share and above tangible book value (non-GAAP) of $9.70 per share. The Company updated its valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2020 based on the drop in the Company's stock price during 2020. However, taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our local economy, we determined that no impairment charge to goodwill was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition and will reevaluate any impairment of our goodwill should economic or market conditions further deteriorate as a result of the pandemic.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our Shore Premier Finance ( SPF\u201d) division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nTotal interest income decreased $42.0 million, or 5.9%, and non-interest expense increased $28.6 million, or 10.4%. This was offset by a $61.4 million, or 39.6%, decrease in total interest expense and a $12.3 million, or 12.3%, increase in non-interest income. The primary drivers of the decrease in interest income were a $33.0 million decrease in loan interest income, a $5.7 million decrease in investment security income and a $3.3 million decrease in interest income on deposits with other banks. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.0 million increase in occupancy and equipment expense, a $2.9 million increase in data processing expense and an $13.0 million increase in other operating expenses resulting from a $17.0 million increase in our reserve for unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was due to a $51.0 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $7.7 million decrease in interest on FHLB borrowed funds. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $14.8 million increase in mortgage lending income, a $4.8 million increase in dividend income from FHLB, FRB, FNBB and other equity investments, and a $3.8 million increase in other income, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $3.4 million decrease in other service charges and fees and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. Income tax expense decreased by $32.8 million during the year due a reduction in net income as well as $3.7 million in tax expense incurred in the third quarter of 2019 due to the Company surrendering $47.5 million of underperforming separate account bank owned life insurance.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur efficiency ratio was 42.63% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 40.34% for the same period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.36%, an improvement of 19 basis points from the 40.55% reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. (See Table 23 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation).\nOur return on average assets was 1.33% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.93% for the same period in 2019. Our annualized return on average common equity was 8.57% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 12.01% for the same period in 2019.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%. The COVID-19 crisis and the accompanying governmental response has created a tremendous amount of excess liquidity in the market. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $691.7 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $747.0 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders' equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing loans increased to $74.1 million, or 0.66%, of total loans from $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 331.10% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $24.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $17.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $43.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $530,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $429,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing assets increased to $78.6 million, or 0.48%, of total assets from $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $25.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $22.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $46.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $39.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $564,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $463,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market consists of one loan that is assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place this loan on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loan that makes up the total balance is still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place this loan on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\n2019 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5%, and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8%, increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019, the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on interest earning assets was 5.45% and 5.39% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $12.82 billion to $13.26 billion. The increase in earning assets is primarily the result of our acquisition in June 2018 and an increase in taxable investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $35.9 million and $41.5 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. We recognized $3.3 million in loan payoff events for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we experienced approximately $2.0 million in increased investment premium amortization. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 1.55% and 1.27% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $9.76 billion to $10.02 billion. The reduction in accretion income, decrease in loan payoff events and the increase in investment premium amortization reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur efficiency ratio was 40.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 38.48% for the same period in 2018. For year ended 2019, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.55%, which increased from the 37.64% reported for the year ended 2018 (See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation). The increase in the efficiency ratio is primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $3.3 million decrease in non-interest income which was only partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in net interest income.\nOur return on average assets was 1.93% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.06% for the same period in 2018. Our return on average common equity was 12.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 13.17% for the same period in 2018.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2019 decreased $270.4 million to $15.03 billion from the $15.30 billion reported as of December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $167.3 million, and our loan portfolio decreased $202.2 million to $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $11.07 billion as of December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased $161.6 million to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $2.35 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $204.4 million increase in retained earnings and the $30.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the repurchase of $84.9 million of our common stock during 2019. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing loans decreased to $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans from $64.2 million, or 0.58%, of total loans as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019, compared to 169.35% as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $17.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $34.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $43.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $429,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $179,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing assets decreased to $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets from $78.0 million, or 0.51%, of total assets as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $22.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $24.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $39.2 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $50.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $463,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $306,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing assets from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOverview. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and stock options.\nRevenue Recognition. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts - These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other service charges and fees - These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial CFG loan fees. The interchange fees are recorded in the period the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts. Centennial CFG loan fees are based on loan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310. Interchange fees were $14.9 million and $14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Centennial CFG loan fees were $8.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company's portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet ( OBS\u201d) credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration ( PCD\u201d) that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield was deemed to be immaterial and was reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption on of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined than an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was not deemed material. However, the Company evaluated the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 and determined that an $842,000 provision for credit losses was necessary. No additional provision was deemed necessary during the remainder of 2020. See Note 3 for further discussion.\nInvestments - Available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nInvestments - Held-to-Maturity. Securities held-to-maturity, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Effective January 1, 2019, as permitted by ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the Company reclassified the prepayable held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) investment securities, with a fair value of $193.6 million and $834,000 in net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2018, to available-for-sale investment securities.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management's intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> All other construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family senior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Multifamily\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Owner occupies commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Consumer auto\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer - SPF\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures: The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as unfunded commitments expense within non-interest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale. Real estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not\u201d means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined\u201d and upon examination\u201d also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management's judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable.\nStock Compensation. In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award.\nAcquisitions\nLH-Finance\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People's United Bank, N.A. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $421.2 million in cash. LH-Finance provides direct consumer financing for USCG registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, LH-Finance provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, LH-Finance had approximately $409.1 million in total assets, including $407.4 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $14.6 million being recorded.\nThe acquired portfolio of loans is now housed in our SPF division. The SPF division is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, we opened a new loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSee Note 2 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of LH-Finance.\nShore Premier Finance\nOn June 30, 2018, the Company, completed the acquisition of Shore Premier Finance ( SPF\u201d), a division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, the bank subsidiary of Union Bankshares Corporation. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $377.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and 1,250,000 shares of HBI common stock. SPF provides direct consumer financing for United States Coast Guard ( USCG\u201d) registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, SPF provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, SPF had approximately $377.0 million in total assets, including $376.2 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $30.5 million being recorded.\nThis portfolio of loans is now housed in a division of Centennial known as Shore Premier Finance. The SPF division of Centennial is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, Centennial opened a new loan production office in Chesapeake, Virginia, to house the SPF division. Through the SPF division, Centennial is working to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans.\nSee Note 2 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of SPF.\nFuture Acquisitions\nIn our continuing evaluation of our growth plans, we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can complement our organic growth and de novo branching growth strategies. We anticipate that our principal acquisition focus will be to continue to expand our presence in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets through pursuing both non-FDIC-assisted and FDIC-assisted bank acquisitions. However, as financial opportunities in other market areas arise, we may seek to expand into those areas.\nWe will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our Company. Our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors.\nBranches\nAs opportunities arise, we will continue to open new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas.\nDuring 2020, we did not open any de novo branches but opened a loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland, under the management of the SPF division in connection with our acquisition of LH-Finance. During 2019, we opened branch locations in Orlando and Hialeah, Florida, and Russellville, Arkansas. We also opened a loan production office in Miami, Florida, during 2019 under the management of Centennial CFG.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 161 branch locations. There were 77 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our SPF division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5% and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8% increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income, which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019 the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate (26.135% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 25.819% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 26.135% for year ended December 31, 2018).\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Funds target rate, which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds, increased four times in 2018. First, the target rate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75% on March 21, 2018; second, the rate was increased on June 13, 2018 to 1.75% to 2.00%; third, the rate was increased on September 26, 2018 to 2.00% to 2.25%; and fourth, the rate was increased on December 19, 2018 to 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December 31, 2020, which has decreased from the target rate of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $20.1 million, or 3.5%, to $588.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $568.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase in net interest income was the result of a $61.4 million decrease in interest expense partially offset by a $41.3 million decrease in interest income. The $41.3 million decrease in interest income was primarily the result lower yields on our loans. The higher level of earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $43.5 million. The $61.4 million decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of our interest-bearing liabilities repricing in a lower interest rate environment. The lower yield on our interest earning assets resulted in an approximately $84.8 million decrease in interest income. The repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities in a lower interest rate environment resulted in an approximately $62.2 million decrease in interest expense. The higher level of our interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $797,000.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on interest earning assets was 5.45% and 5.39% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $12.82 billion to $13.26 billion. The increase in earning assets is primarily the result of our acquisition in June 2018 and an increase in taxable investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $35.9 million and $41.5 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. We recognized $3.3 million in loan payoff events for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we experienced approximately $2.0 million in increased investment premium amortization. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 1.55% and 1.27% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $9.76 billion to $10.02 billion. The reduction in accretion income, decrease in loan payoff events and the increase in investment premium amortization reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $1.9 million, or 0.3% to $568.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $566.5 million for the same period in 2018. This increase in net interest income was the result of a $32.4 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $30.4 million increase in interest expense. The $32.4 million increase in interest income was primarily the result of a higher level of earning assets accompanied by higher yields on our loans. The higher level of earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $23.0 million. The higher yield on our interest earning assets resulted in an approximately $9.4 million increase in interest income. The repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities in a higher interest rate environment resulted in an approximately $29.7 million increase in interest expense. The higher level of our interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $695,000.\nTables 2 and 3 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as changes in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the years 2020 compared to 2019 and 2019 compared to 2018.\nTable 2: Analysis of Net Interest Income\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 675,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 717,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 685,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fully taxable equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income - fully taxable equivalent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 681,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 723,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 690,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 154,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income - fully taxable equivalent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 588,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 568,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 566,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Yield on earning assets - fully taxable equivalent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.45\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest spread - fully taxable equivalent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin - fully taxable equivalent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 3: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in interest income due to change in\nearning assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in interest income due to change in\nearning asset yields\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84,772\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in interest expense due to change in\ninterest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (797\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in interest expense due to change in\ninterest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,721\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 4 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amount outstanding, the interest income or expense on that amount and the average rate earned or expensed for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company's portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nLoans. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nAcquired loans. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. This is commonly referred to as double accounting.\u201d\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> All other construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family senior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Multifamily\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Owner occupies commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Consumer auto\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer - SPF\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nInvestments - Available-for-sale: The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nCredit Loss Expense: During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $112.3 million of total credit loss expense compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This expense is comprised of the following components - investment securities, CECL double accounting for LH-Finance and CECL COVID-19 loan provision. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $842,000 for credit losses on the investment portfolio as a result of economic uncertainties related to COVID-19, $9.3 million for CECL double accounting for LH-Finance and $102.1 million for the CECL COVID-19 loan provision. Our CECL provisioning model is significantly tied to projected unemployment rates. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1 to December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans as well as loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording the $102.1 million provision. Net charge-offs to average total loans increased to 0.11% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, non-performing loans to total loans increased from 0.50% as of December 31, 2019 to 0.66% as of December 31, 2020.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income was $111.8 million in 2020, compared to $99.5 million in 2019 and $102.8 million in 2018. Our recurring non-interest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other service charges and fees, trust fees, mortgage lending, insurance commissions, increase in cash value of life insurance and dividends.\nTable 6 measures the various components of our non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as well as changes for the years 2020

To account for the slight increase in state income tax expense due to respective state income tax rates, the Company raised its marginal tax rate from 25.819% to 26.135% for 2020.\nDuring 2019, the State of Florida reduced its corporate income tax rate from 5.50% to 4.458% for the tax years January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021. As a result of this reduction, our income taxes were reduced by $1.0 million. This rate decline lowered the Company's marginal tax rate from 26.135% to 25.819% for 2019.\nAdditionally, during 2019, the Company made a strategic decision to surrender $47.5 million of its underperforming BOLI. When a BOLI contract is surrendered the gains within the policy become taxable as well as a 10% IRS penalty on the gain. As a result of this BOLI decision, the Company recorded a $3.7 million tax expense related to this transaction. Excluding the BOLI tax expense, income tax expense would have been $92.4 million for a decrease of $2.7 million, or 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The effective tax rate excluding the BOLI tax expense was 23.97% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome tax expense decreased $32.8 million, or 34.2%, to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $96.1 million for 2019. Income tax expense increased $1.0 million, or 1.0%, to $96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $95.1 million for 2018. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 22.78%, 24.92% and 24.05%, respectively. The Company's marginal tax rate was 26.135%, 25.819% and 26.135% for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%. The COVID-19 crisis and the accompanying governmental response has created a tremendous amount of excess liquidity in the market. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $691.7 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $747.0 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders' equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2019 decreased $270.4 million to $15.03 billion from the $15.30 billion reported as of December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $167.3 million, and our loan portfolio decreased $202.2 million to $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $11.07 billion as of December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased $161.6 million to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $2.35 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $204.4 million increase in retained earnings and the $30.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the repurchase of $84.9 million of our common stock during 2019. The improvement in stockholders' equity for 2019 was 6.9%.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio averaged $11.50 billion and $10.96 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Loans receivable were $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $351.0 million, or 3.2%.\nThe CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes an allocation for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). This program is known as the Paycheck Protection Program. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, so long as employee and compensation levels of the borrower are maintained, and the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred for the first six months of the loan. The loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1.00% to 5.00%, based on the size of the loan. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act ( PPP/HCEA Act\u201d) was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $691.7 million of PPP loans. This balance consists of $632.5 million in commercial & industrial loans and $59.2 million in other loans.\nDuring 2020, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $351.0 million in loans. The increase in the loan portfolio is primarily due to the $691.7 million of PPP loans held as of December 31, 2020 as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $747.0 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the effects of PPP loan originations, Centennial CFG experienced $59.9 million of organic loan decline during the year, while the remaining footprint, excluding the acquisition of LH-Finance, experienced $687.1 million of organic loan decline during 2020. The $848.7 million in PPP loans originated in 2020 have decreased by $157.0 million to $691.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2019, the Company experienced a decline of approximately $202.2 million in loans compared to 2018. Centennial CFG produced $49.6 million of net organic loan growth during 2019 while the legacy footprint experienced $251.7 million of organic loan decline. Centennial CFG had total loans of $1.60 billion at December 31, 2019.\nThe most significant components of the loan portfolio were commercial real estate, residential real estate, consumer and commercial and industrial loans. These loans are generally secured by residential or commercial real estate or business or personal property. Although these loans are primarily originated within our franchises in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama and Centennial CFG, the property securing these loans may not physically be located within our market areas of Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and New York. Loans receivable were approximately $3.72 billion, $4.82 billion, $245.0 million, $893.8 million and $1.54 billion as of December 31, 2020 in Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $426.5 million of construction/land development loans which were collateralized by land. This consisted of $96.5 million for raw land and $330.0 million for land with commercial and/or residential lots.\nTable 8 presents our loans receivable balances by category as of December 31, 2020,

Our commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized (where defined) over a 15 to 30-year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by assessing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower's liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, we will loan up to 85% of the value of improved property, 65% of the value of raw land and 75% of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the collateral is rental property, with second lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, commercial real estate loans totaled $6.11 billion, or 54.4% of loans receivable, as compared to $6.28 billion, or 57.8% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $2.18 billion, $2.72 billion, $117.3 million, zero and $1.09 billion at December 31, 2020, respectively.\nResidential Real Estate Loans. We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market areas. Approximately 35.0% and 53.5% of our residential mortgage loans consist of owner occupied 1-4 family properties and non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental), respectively, as of December 31, 2020, with the remaining 11.5% relating to condos and mobile homes. Residential real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90%. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to many factors including the borrower's ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, residential real estate loans totaled $2.07 billion, or 18.5%, of loans receivable, compared to $2.31 billion, or 21.2% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2019. Residential real estate loans originated in our franchises in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $761.6 million, $1.15 billion, $63.1 million, zero and $95.7 million at December 31, 2020, respectively.\nConsumer Loans. Our consumer loans are composed of secured and unsecured loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats as a result of our acquisition of SPF on June 30, 2018 as well as our acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics.\nAs of December 31, 2020, consumer loans totaled $864.7 million, or 7.7% of loans receivable, compared to $511.9 million, or 4.7% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2019. Consumer loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $40.2 million, $9.5 million, $975,000, $814.1 million ($331.4 million of which was acquired from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020) and zero at December 31, 2020, respectively.\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion. The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower's liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral. Generally speaking, accounts receivable are financed at between 50% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will range between 50% and 80% (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, commercial and industrial loans totaled $1.90 billion, or 16.9% of loans receivable, which compared to $1.53 billion, or 14.1% of loans receivable, as of December 31, 2019. Commercial and industrial loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $613.4 million, $829.2 million, $57.5 million, $79.7 million ($74.8 million of which was acquired from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020) and $316.7 million at December 31, 2020, respectively.\nAgricultural Loans. Agricultural loans include loans for financing agricultural production, including loans to businesses or individuals engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops and are not categorized as part of real estate loans. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles or other agricultural-related collateral. A portion of our portfolio of agricultural loans is comprised of loans to individuals which would normally be characterized as consumer loans except for the fact that the individual borrowers are primarily engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops.\nAs of December 31, 2020, agricultural loans totaled $66.9 million, or 0.6% of loans receivable, compared to the $63.6 million, or 0.6% of loans receivable as of December 31, 2019. Agricultural loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $61.4 million, $5.5 million, zero, zero and zero at December 31, 2020, respectively.\nTable 9 presents the distribution of the maturity of our total loans as of December 31, 2020. The table also presents the portion of our loans that have fixed interest rates and interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans based on changes in the interest rate environment.\nThe loans acquired during our acquisitions accrete interest income through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the expected cash flows. Increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans (reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the weighted-average life of the loans).\nTable 9: Maturity of Loans\nTable

non-accruing).\nWhen management determines that a loan is no longer performing, and that collection of interest appears doubtful, the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest. Our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as special mention\u201d or otherwise classified or on non-accrual status.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration that were previously classified as PCI and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield were deemed to be immaterial and were reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense.\nPrior to 2019, we had purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality in our financial statements as a result of our historical acquisitions. The credit metrics most heavily impacted by our acquisitions of acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality were the following credit quality indicators listed in Table 10 below:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-performing loans to total loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-performing assets to total assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 10 sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Our bank subsidiary recognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as non-accrual, the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued, unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for credit losses.\nTotal non-performing loans were $74.1 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $54.8 million as of December 31, 2019, for an increase of $19.3 million. The $19.3 million increase in non-performing loans is the result of a $6.2 million increase in non-performing loans in our Arkansas market, a $8.4 million increase in non-performing loans in our Florida market, a $101,000 increase in non-performing loans in our Alabama market, a $1.8 million increase in non-performing loans attributable to our SPF market and a $2.8 million increase in non-performing loans in our Centennial CFG market. Non-performing loans December 31, 2020 are $24.1 million, $43.1 million, $530,000, $3.6 million and $2.8 million in the Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets, respectively.\nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market consists of one loan that is assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place this loan on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loan that makes up the total balance is still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place this loan on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global markets driven by supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions, retail closures, and reduced consumer spending and sentiment, amongst other factors. The global and economic impacts of the coronavirus continue to evolve, and the Company is continuing to closely monitor the situation. While the Company believes our allowance for credit losses is adequate at December 31, 2020, as additional facts become known about relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability and our assumptions, it may result in us making additions to the provision for credit losses during 2021. Our CECL provisioning model is significantly tied to projected unemployment rates. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1 to the end of December 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans as well as loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTroubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) generally occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term. As a result, we will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. In those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually either reduce the monthly payment and/or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months. For our TDRs that accrue interest at the time the loan is restructured, it would be a rare exception to have charged-off any portion of the loan. As of December 31, 2020, we had $10.7 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non-accrual in Table 10. Our Florida market contains $8.6 million, our Arkansas market contains $2.1 million and our Alabama market contains zero of these restructured loans.\nA loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted resulting in classification as a TDR. These loans can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on an accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a non-accrual loan that is restructured remains on non-accrual for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay under the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period. If the borrower's ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan will remain in a non-accrual status.\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act enacted in March 2020 provides financial institutions optional temporary relief from the TDR classification requirements for certain COVID-19 related loan modifications. Specifically, financial institutions may elect to suspend TDR classification for certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after termination of the President's national emergency declaration for COVID-19. Further, financial institutions do not need to determine impairment associated with certain loan concessions that would otherwise have been required for TDRs (e.g., interest rate concessions, payment deferrals, or loan extensions). On April 7, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency statement clarifying the relationship between the Section 4013 of the CARES Act and previous guidance issued by the agencies on March 22, 2020. This interagency statement encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their payment obligations because of COVID-19 and states that the agencies view loan modification programs as positive actions that can mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19. The Company relied on Section 4013 of the CARES Act in accounting for loan modifications in the 4th quarter 2020. The Company granted loan modification to 56 loans for a total of $330.7 million. Of the 56 loans currently on deferment, 51 of the loans totaling $271.1 million chose interest only deferment and have returned to paying interest monthly, with the majority of these loans having modifications for 18 to 24 month interest only payments with a return to full principal and interest payments at the end of the modification term.\nThe majority of the Bank's loan modifications relates to commercial lending and involves reducing the interest rate, changing from a principal and interest payment to interest-only, a lengthening of the amortization period, or a combination of some or all of the three. In addition, it is common for the Bank to seek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan. At December 31, 2020, the amount of TDRs was $12.3 million, a decrease of 24.2% from $16.3 million at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 87.1% and 74.6%, respectively, of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure.\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale were $4.4 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $9.1 million as of December 31, 2019 for a decrease of $4.7 million. The foreclosed assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of $1.5 million of assets located in Arkansas, $2.9 million of assets located in Florida, $34,000 located in Alabama and zero from SPF and Centennial CFG.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one foreclosed property with a carrying value greater than $1.0 million. This property was a development property in Florida acquired from BOC with a carrying value of $2.1 million at December 31, 2020. The Company does not currently anticipate any additional losses on this property. As of December 31, 2020, no other foreclosed assets held for sale have a carrying value greater than $1.0 million.\nTable 11 shows the summary of foreclosed assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 11: Total Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-farm/non-residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction/land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential real estate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential 1-4 family\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multifamily residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total foreclosed assets held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans. Impaired loans include non-performing loans (loans past due 90 days or more and non-accrual loans), criticized and/or classified loans with a specific allocation, loans categorized as TDRs and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing (loans included in multiple categories are only included once). As of December 31, 2020, average impaired loans were $96.6 million compared to $82.1 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 impaired loans were $112.7 million compared to $78.9 million as of December 31, 2019, for an increase of $33.8 million. This increase is primarily associated with the $17.8 million increase in impaired loans in our Arkansas market, the $11.7 million increase in impaired loans in our Florida market, the $1.8 million increase in impaired loans for our SPF market, and the $2.8 million increase in impaired loans for our Centennial CFG market, which was partially offset by the $280,000 decrease in impaired loans for our Alabama market since December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets accounted for approximately $50.1 million, $55.7 million, $530,000, $3.6 million and $2.8 million of the impaired loans, respectively.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration that were previously classified as PCI and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield were deemed to be immaterial and were reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense. The Company held approximately $760,000 in PCD loans as of December 31, 2020.\nPast Due and Non-Accrual Loans\nTable 12 shows the summary non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017

Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance, including loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million, which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax.\nOverview. The allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nThe Company uses the discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method to estimate expected losses for all of Company's loan pools. These pools are as follows: construction & land development; other commercial real estate; residential real estate; commercial & industrial; and consumer & other. The loan portfolio pools were selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. For each of these loan pools, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on historical internal data. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers.\nFor all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over four quarters on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver forecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when developing the forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> All other construction\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 1-4 family senior liens\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Multifamily\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Owner occupies commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Consumer auto\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Other consumer - SPF\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and time expectations prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery) produces an expected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument expected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present value of expected cash flows ( NPV\u201d). An allowance for credit loss is established for the difference between the instrument's NPV and amortized cost basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as unfunded commitments expense within non-interest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nSpecific Allocations. As a general rule, if a specific allocation is warranted, it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship. Typically, when it becomes evident through the payment history or a financial statement review that a loan or relationship is no longer supported by the cash flows of the asset and/or borrower and has become collateral dependent, we will use appraisals or other collateral analysis to determine if collateral impairment has occurred. The amount or likelihood of loss on this credit may not yet be evident, so a charge-off would not be prudent. However, if the analysis indicates that an impairment has occurred, then a specific allocation will be determined for this loan. If our existing appraisal is outdated or the collateral has been subject to significant market changes, we will obtain a new appraisal for this impairment analysis. The majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent at the present time, so third-party appraisals were used to determine the necessary impairment for these loans. Cash flow available to service debt was used for the other impaired loans. This analysis is performed each quarter in connection with the preparation of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and if necessary, adjustments are made to the specific allocation provided for a particular loan.\nFor collateral dependent loans, we do not consider an appraisal outdated simply due to the passage of time. However, if an appraisal is older than 13 months and if market or other conditions have deteriorated and we believe that the current market value of the property is not within approximately 20% of the appraised value, we will consider the appraisal outdated and order either a new appraisal or an internal validation report for the impairment analysis. The recognition of any provision or related charge-off on a collateral dependent loan is either through annual credit analysis or, many times, when the relationship becomes delinquent. If the borrower is not current, we will update our credit and cash flow analysis to determine the borrower's repayment ability. If we determine this ability does not exist and it appears that the collection of the entire principal and interest is not likely, then the loan could be placed on non-accrual status. In any case, loans are classified as non-accrual no later than 105 days past due. If the loan requires a quarterly impairment analysis, this analysis is completed in conjunction with the completion of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Any exposure identified through the impairment analysis is shown as a specific reserve on the individual impairment. If it is determined that a new appraisal or internal validation report is required, it is ordered and will be taken into consideration during completion of the next impairment analysis.\nIn estimating the net realizable value of the collateral, management may deem it appropriate to discount the appraisal based on the applicable circumstances. In such case, the amount charged off may result in loan principal outstanding being below fair value as presented in the appraisal.\nBetween the receipt of the original appraisal and the updated appraisal, we monitor the loan's repayment history. If the loan is $3.0 million or greater or the total loan relationship is $5.0 million or greater, our policy requires an annual credit review. Our policy requires financial statements from the borrowers and guarantors at least annually. In addition, we calculate the global repayment ability of the borrower/guarantors at least annually.\nAs a general rule, when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected, or by law at 105 days past due, we will reflect that loan as non-performing. It will remain non-performing until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we will collect the full principal and accrued interest.\nWhen the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been determined, a charge-off should be taken in the period it is determined. If a partial charge-off occurs, the quarterly impairment analysis will determine if the loan is still impaired, and thus continues to require a specific allocation.\nLoans Collectively Evaluated for Impairment. Loans receivable collectively evaluated for impairment increased by approximately $100.0 million from $10.66 billion at December 31, 2019 to $10.76 billion at December 31, 2020. The percentage of the allowance for credit losses allocated to loans receivable collectively evaluated for impairment to the total loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased from 0.91% at December 31, 2019 to 2.18% at December 31, 2020.\nCharge-offs and Recoveries. Total charge-offs increased to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total recoveries decreased to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2019.\nThe net loans charged off for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $12.4 million, $8.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $4.4 million, $4.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs are from our Arkansas market. For the years ended December 31, 2020 2019 and 2018, approximately $7.9 million, $3.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs are from our Florida market. Approximately $11,000, $295,000 and $176,000 relates to net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on loans in our Alabama market. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $80,000, $83,000 and zero of the net charge-offs are from our SPF market. There have been zero charge-offs for Centennial CFG since the franchise was formed in 2015.\nWhile the 2020 charge-offs and recoveries consisted of many relationships, there were two individual relationships consisting of charge-offs greater than $1.0 million. The first was a $1.9 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan that had been acquired in the Stonegate acquisition. The second was a $2.5 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Florida market. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no individual relationships consisting of charge-offs greater than $1.0 million.\nWe have not charged off an amount less than what was determined to be the fair value of the collateral as presented in the appraisal, less estimated costs to sell (for collateral dependent loans), for any period presented. Loans partially charged-off are placed on non-accrual status until it is proven that the borrower's repayment ability with respect to the remaining principal balance can be reasonably assured. This is usually established over a period of 6-12 months of timely payment performance.\nTable 14 shows the allowance for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries for loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 14: Analysis of Allowance for credit losses\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue. Securities within the portfolio are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity. Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. The estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was 2.8 years as of December 31, 2020.\nEffective January 1, 2019, as permitted by ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the Company reclassified the prepayable held-to-maturity investment securities, with a fair value of $193.6 million and $834,000 in net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2018, to available-for-sale investment securities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $192.8 million of held-to-maturity securities. Of the $192.8 million of held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2018, $3.3 million were invested in U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, $57.3 million were invested in mortgage-backed securities and $132.2 million were invested in state and political subdivisions.\nSecurities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities were $2.47 billion and $2.08 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.18 billion, or 47.6%, of our available-for-sale securities were invested in mortgage-backed securities, compared to $1.21 billion, or 58.2%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2019. To reduce our income tax burden, $927.9 million, or 37.5%, of our available-for-sale securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020, was primarily invested in tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions, compared to $439.6 million, or 21.1%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2019. We had $327.0 million, or 13.2%, invested in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises as of December 31, 2020, compared to $397.6 million, or 19.1%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2019. Also, we had approximately $41.0 million, or 1.7%, invested in other securities as of December 31, 2020, compared to $33.0 million, or 1.6%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2019.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, the Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any debt securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company determined a provision for credit losses of $842,000 was necessary for the investment portfolio as a result of economic uncertainties related to COVID-19. For the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company determined that no additional provision for credit losses was necessary for the portfolio.\nTable 16 presents the carrying value and

Total deposits increased $1.45 billion, or 12.8%, to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019. Deposits are our primary source of funds. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain deposit customers. Those products consist of checking accounts, regular savings deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. In addition, we obtain deposits from state and local entities and, to a lesser extent, U.S. Government and other depository institutions.\nOur policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. From time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, we accept brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250,000, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks. We also participate in the One-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) service and similar services, which provide for one-way buy transactions among banks for the purpose of purchasing cost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these sources represent a reliable and cost-efficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nTable 18 reflects the classification of the brokered deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 18: Brokered Deposits\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CDARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insured Cash Sweep and Other Transaction Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 625,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 484,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Brokered Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 635,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 579,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. We will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing. We may allow higher rate deposits to run off during periods of limited loan demand. We believe that additional funds can be attracted, and deposit growth can be realized through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs.\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Funds target rate, which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds, increased four times from a target rate of 0.25% to 0.50% as of December 31, 2015 to a target rate of 1.25% to 1.50% as of December 31, 2017. The Federal Reserve increased the target rate four times in 2018. First, the target rate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75% on March 21, 2018; second, the rate was increased on June 13, 2018 to 1.75% to 2.00%; third, the rate was increased on September 26, 2018 to 2.00% to 2.25%; and fourth, the rate was increased on December 19, 2018 to 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December 31, 2020, which has decreased from the target rate of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 19 reflects the classification of the

sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) of substantially identical securities. The amounts advanced under resale agreements and the amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements are carried on the balance sheet at the amount advanced. Interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest expense. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 25.2 million, or 17.5%, from $143.7 million as of December 31, 2019 to $168.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nFHLB and Other Borrowed Funds\nOur FHLB borrowed funds were $400.0 million and $621.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company had no other borrowed funds as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, all of the outstanding balances were classified as long-term advances. At December 31, 2019, $75.0 million and $546.4 million of the outstanding balance were issued as short-term and long-term advances, respectively. Our remaining FHLB borrowing capacity was $3.32 billion and $2.79 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the entire balance of our FHLB borrowings mature after 2025.\nSubordinated Debentures\nSubordinated debentures, which consist of subordinated debt securities and guaranteed payments on trust preferred securities, were $370.3 million and $369.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe trust preferred securities are tax-advantaged issues that qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment subject to certain limitations. Distributions on these securities are included in interest expense. Each of the trusts is a statutory business trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds in our subordinated debentures, the sole asset of each trust. The trust preferred securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the subordinated debentures held by the trust. We wholly own the common securities of each trust. Each trust's ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon our making payment on the related subordinated debentures. Our obligations under the subordinated securities and other relevant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of each respective trust's obligations under the trust securities issued by each respective trust.\nThe Bank acquired $12.5 million in trust preferred securities with a fair value of $9.8 million from the Stonegate acquisition. The difference between the fair value purchased of $9.8 million and the $12.5 million face amount, is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the debentures. The associated subordinated debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, prior to maturity at our option on a quarterly basis when interest is due and payable and in whole at any time within 90 days following the occurrence and continuation of certain changes in the tax treatment or capital treatment of the debentures.\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued at 99.997% of par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and issuance costs, of approximately $297.0 million. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on April 15, 2027. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.\nStockholders' Equity\nStockholders' equity was $2.61 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.51 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our equity to asset ratio was 15.9% and 16.7%, respectively. Book value per common share was $15.78 at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.10 at December 31, 2019.\nCommon Stock Cash Dividends. We declared cash dividends on our common stock of $0.53, $0.51 and $0.46 per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The common stock dividend payout ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 40.88%, 29.57% and 26.59% respectively.\nStock Repurchase Program. On January 18, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of our common stock under our previously approved stock repurchase program, which brought the remaining balance of authorized shares to repurchase to 19,752,000 shares. During 2020, we utilized a portion of this stock repurchase program and repurchased a total of 1,533,560 shares with a weighted-average stock price of $16.72 per share. Shares repurchased through December 31, 2020 under the program total 15,908,335 shares. The remaining balance available for repurchase was 3,843,665 shares at December 31, 2020. On January 22, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock under this repurchase program.\nLiquidity and Capital Adequacy Requirements\nParent Company Liquidity. The primary sources for payment of our operating expenses, and dividends are current cash on hand ($152.7 million as of December 31, 2020), dividends received from our bank subsidiary and a $20.0 million unfunded line of credit with another financial institution.\nRisk-Based Capital. We, as well as our bank subsidiary, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that, if enforced, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components, risk weightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\u201d and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act ( Basel III\u201d). Basel III applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and savings and loan holding companies. Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019 when the phase-in period ended, and the full capital conservation buffer requirement became effective.\nBasel III permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and outstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The rule phases out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. Because our total consolidated assets were less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, our outstanding trust preferred securities continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital. However, now that the Company has exceeded $15 billion in assets, if the Company acquires another financial institution in the future, then the Tier 1 treatment of the Company's outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out, but those securities will still be treated as Tier 2 capital.\nBasel III also amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 capital\u201d requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital\u201d ratio, a 4% Tier 1 leverage capital\u201d ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital\u201d ratio and an 8% total risk-based capital\u201d ratio.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject.\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations and mature on April 15, 2027. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of April 15, 2022, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to April 15, 2022, at its option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. The Notes provide the Company with additional Tier 2 regulatory capital to support expected future growth.\nOn December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the risk-based capital ratios presented below.\nTable 21 presents our risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 21: Risk-Based Capital\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,605,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,511,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASC 326 transitional period adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,003,288\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (994,554\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gain) loss on available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,120\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total common equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,615,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Qualifying trust preferred securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,686,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,571,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 2 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 245,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASC 326 transitional period adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,333\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Disallowed allowance for credit losses (limited to 1.25%\nof risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36,911\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Qualifying allowance for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 151,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Qualifying subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Tier 2 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,137,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,972,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets for leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,547,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,949,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk weighted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,039,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,066,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratios at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum guidelines -

commitments. Examples of these commitments include but are not limited to operating lease obligations, FHLB advances & other borrowings, lines of credit, subordinated debentures, unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.\nCommitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding, conditional agreements generally having certain expiration or termination dates. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management's credit assessment of the customer. The commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment does not necessarily represent future requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company had total outstanding letters of credit amounting to $56.1 million and $58.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the majority of maturities ranging from currently due to four years.\nTable 23 presents the anticipated funding requirements of our most significant financial commitments, excluding interest, as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 23: Funding Requirements of Financial Commitments\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One-Three\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three-Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Greater than\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances & other borrowings by contractual\nmaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 370,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 370,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,478,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 825,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 189,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 329,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,823,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measurements\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, including earnings, as adjusted; diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted; tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average common equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible equity, as adjusted; tangible equity to tangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables below present non-GAAP reconciliations of earnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted as well as the non-GAAP computations of tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average common equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible equity, as adjusted; tangible equity to tangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted. The items used in these calculations are included in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they exclude certain items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains and losses. Management believes the exclusion of these items in expressing earnings provides a meaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing our financial measures and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of our business, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance.\nIn Table 24 below, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.\nTable 24: Earnings, As Adjusted\nTable 185: <table>

net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding items such as merger expenses and/or certain other gains and losses.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion should be read together with the Summary Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial data included in this document. In addition to the historical information provided below, we have made certain estimates and forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the section of this document captioned Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d HBI,\u201d us,\u201d we\u201d and our\u201d refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis.\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank ( Centennial\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $16.40 billion, loans receivable, net of $10.98 billion, total deposits of $12.73 billion, and stockholders' equity of $2.61 billion.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and FHLB borrowed funds are our primary source of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our net interest margin, return on average assets and return on average common equity. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP). The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain items such as merger expenses, hurricane expenses and/or gains and losses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\n\n (1) See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation. \n (2) See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation. \n2020 Overview\nRecent Developments - COVID-19\nThe rapid spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) hit the United States during the first quarter of 2020 and has continued through December 31, 2020. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These actions have had a significant impact on markets driven by supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions, retail closures, and reduced consumer spending and sentiment, amongst other factors. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.\nWhile our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that have been deemed, or who are employed by businesses that have been deemed, to be non-essential. Further, many of our customers that have been categorized to date as essential businesses, or who are employed by businesses that have been categorized as essential businesses, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. We have reopened our banking lobbies in order to serve customers in person, while still offering service through drive-thru tellers as well as electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we continue to support working remotely. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments for certain consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our loan deferrals decreased to $330.7 million on 56 loans from the June 30, 2020 balance of $3.18 billion on 4,209 loans. Of the 56 loans currently on deferment, 51 of our loans totaling $271.1 million chose interest only deferment and now have returned to paying interest monthly, with the majority of these loans having modifications for 18-24 month interest only payments with a return to full principal and interest payments at the end of the modification term. The hospitality sector has been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and represents 52.0% of the deferment balance as of December 31, 2020. The geographic distribution of these deferrals is similar through all of our markets. Our review of deferment requests required updated interim operating statements, balance sheet and liquidity verifications, and validation of the current risk rating.\nIn April 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES\u201d Act) established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses. During 2020, as a participating lender, we have generated 8,702 loans to both existing and new customers. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding PPP loan balances were $691.7 million. The average loan size is $88,000.\nWe also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Our stock price has historically traded above its per share book value and tangible book value (non-GAAP). However, at certain times during 2020, our stock price fell below book value. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. During 2020, our common stock traded as low as $9.71 per share; however, our common stock closed on December 31, 2020 at $19.48 per share, which was above book value of $15.78 per share and above tangible book value (non-GAAP) of $9.70 per share. The Company updated its valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2020 based on the drop in the Company's stock price during 2020. However, taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our local economy, we determined that no impairment charge to goodwill was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition and will reevaluate any impairment of our goodwill should economic or market conditions further deteriorate as a result of the pandemic.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our Shore Premier Finance ( SPF\u201d) division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nTotal interest income decreased $42.0 million, or 5.9%, and non-interest expense increased $28.6 million, or 10.4%. This was offset by a $61.4 million, or 39.6%, decrease in total interest expense and a $12.3 million, or 12.3%, increase in non-interest income. The primary drivers of the decrease in interest income were a $33.0 million decrease in loan interest income, a $5.7 million decrease in investment security income and a $3.3 million decrease in interest income on deposits with other banks. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.0 million increase in occupancy and equipment expense, a $2.9 million increase in data processing expense and an $13.0 million increase in other operating expenses resulting from a $17.0 million increase in our reserve for unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was due to a $51.0 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $7.7 million decrease in interest on FHLB borrowed funds. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $14.8 million increase in mortgage lending income, a $4.8 million increase in dividend income from FHLB, FRB, FNBB and other equity investments, and a $3.8 million increase in other income, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $3.4 million decrease in other service charges and fees and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. Income tax expense decreased by $32.8 million during the year due a reduction in net income as well as $3.7 million in tax expense incurred in the third quarter of 2019 due to the Company surrendering $47.5 million of underperforming separate account bank owned life insurance.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur efficiency ratio was 42.63% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 40.34% for the same period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.36%, an improvement of 19 basis points from the 40.55% reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. (See Table 23 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation).\nOur return on average assets was 1.33% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.93% for the same period in 2019. Our annualized return on average common equity was 8.57% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 12.01% for the same period in 2019.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%. The COVID-19 crisis and the accompanying governmental response has created a tremendous amount of excess liquidity in the market. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $691.7 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $747.0 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders' equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing loans increased to $74.1 million, or 0.66%, of total loans from $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 331.10% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $24.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $17.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $43.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $530,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $429,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing assets increased to $78.6 million, or 0.48%, of total assets from $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $25.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $22.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $46.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $39.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $564,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $463,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market consists of one loan that is assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place this loan on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loan that makes up the total balance is still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place this loan on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\n2019 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5%, and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8%, increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019, the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on interest earning assets was 5.45% and 5.39% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $12.82 billion to $13.26 billion. The increase in earning assets is primarily the result of our acquisition in June 2018 and an increase in taxable investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $35.9 million and $41.5 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. We recognized $3.3 million in loan payoff events for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we experienced approximately $2.0 million in increased investment premium amortization. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 1.55% and 1.27% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $9.76 billion to $10.02 billion. The reduction in accretion income, decrease in loan payoff events and the increase in investment premium amortization reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur efficiency ratio was 40.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 38.48% for the same period in 2018. For year ended 2019, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.55%, which increased from the 37.64% reported for the year ended 2018 (See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation). The increase in the efficiency ratio is primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $3.3 million decrease in non-interest income which was only partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in net interest income.\nOur return on average assets was 1.93% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.06% for the same period in 2018. Our return on average common equity was 12.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 13.17% for the same period in 2018.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2019 decreased $270.4 million to $15.03 billion from the $15.30 billion reported as of December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $167.3 million, and our loan portfolio decreased $202.2 million to $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $11.07 billion as of December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased $161.6 million to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $2.35 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $204.4 million increase in retained earnings and the $30.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the repurchase of $84.9 million of our common stock during 2019. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing loans decreased to $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans from $64.2 million, or 0.58%, of total loans as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019, compared to 169.35% as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $17.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $34.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $43.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $429,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $179,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing assets decreased to $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets from $78.0 million, or 0.51%, of total assets as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $22.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $24.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $39.2 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $50.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $463,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $306,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing assets from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOverview. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and stock options.\nRevenue Recognition. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:\n \u2022 Service charges on deposit accounts - These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied. \n \u2022 Other service charges and fees - These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial CFG loan fees. The interchange fees are recorded in the period the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts. Centennial CFG loan fees are based on loan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310. Interchange fees were $14.9 million and $14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Centennial CFG loan fees were $8.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. \nCredit Losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company's portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet ( OBS\u201d) credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration ( PCD\u201d) that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield was deemed to be immaterial and was reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption on of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined than an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was not deemed material. However, the Company evaluated the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 and determined that an $842,000 provision for credit losses was necessary. No additional provision was deemed necessary during the remainder of 2020. See Note 3 for further discussion.\nInvestments - Available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nInvestments - Held-to-Maturity. Securities held-to-maturity, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Effective January 1, 2019, as permitted by ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the Company reclassified the prepayable held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) investment securities, with a fair value of $193.6 million and $834,000 in net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2018, to available-for-sale investment securities.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management's intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\n \u2022 1-4 family construction \n \u2022 All other construction \n \u2022 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d) & junior liens \n \u2022 1-4 family senior liens \n \u2022 Multifamily \n \u2022 Owner occupies commercial real estate \n \u2022 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate \n \u2022 Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other \n \u2022 Consumer auto \n \u2022 Other consumer \n \u2022 Other consumer - SPF \nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n \u2022 Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower. \n \u2022 The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. \nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures: The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as unfunded commitments expense within non-interest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale. Real estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not\u201d means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined\u201d and upon examination\u201d also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management's judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable.\nStock Compensation. In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award.\nAcquisitions\nLH-Finance\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People's United Bank, N.A. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $421.2 million in cash. LH-Finance provides direct consumer financing for USCG registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, LH-Finance provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, LH-Finance had approximately $409.1 million in total assets, including $407.4 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $14.6 million being recorded.\nThe acquired portfolio of loans is now housed in our SPF division. The SPF division is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, we opened a new loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSee Note 2 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of LH-Finance.\nShore Premier Finance\nOn June 30, 2018, the Company, completed the acquisition of Shore Premier Finance ( SPF\u201d), a division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, the bank subsidiary of Union Bankshares Corporation. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $377.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and 1,250,000 shares of HBI common stock. SPF provides direct consumer financing for United States Coast Guard ( USCG\u201d) registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, SPF provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, SPF had approximately $377.0 million in total assets, including $376.2 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $30.5 million being recorded.\nThis portfolio of loans is now housed in a division of Centennial known as Shore Premier Finance. The SPF division of Centennial is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, Centennial opened a new loan production office in Chesapeake, Virginia, to house the SPF division. Through the SPF division, Centennial is working to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans.\nSee Note 2 Business Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of SPF.\nFuture Acquisitions\nIn our continuing evaluation of our growth plans, we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can complement our organic growth and de novo branching growth strategies. We anticipate that our principal acquisition focus will be to continue to expand our presence in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets through pursuing both non-FDIC-assisted and FDIC-assisted bank acquisitions. However, as financial opportunities in other market areas arise, we may seek to expand into those areas.\nWe will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our Company. Our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors.\nBranches\nAs opportunities arise, we will continue to open new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas.\nDuring 2020, we did not open any de novo branches but opened a loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland, under the management of the SPF division in connection with our acquisition of LH-Finance. During 2019, we opened branch locations in Orlando and Hialeah, Florida, and Russellville, Arkansas. We also opened a loan production office in Miami, Florida, during 2019 under the management of Centennial CFG.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 161 branch locations. There were 77 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our SPF division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5% and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8% increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income, which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019 the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate (26.135% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 25.819% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 26.135% for year ended December 31, 2018).\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Funds target rate, which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds, increased four times in 2018. First, the target rate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75% on March 21, 2018; second, the rate was increased on June 13, 2018 to 1.75% to 2.00%; third, the rate was increased on September 26, 2018 to 2.00% to 2.25%; and fourth, the rate was increased on December 19, 2018 to 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December 31, 2020, which has decreased from the target rate of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $20.1 million, or 3.5%, to $588.6", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This discussion should be read together with the Summary Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial data included in this document. In addition to the historical information provided below, we have made certain estimates and forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the section of this document captioned Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d HBI,\u201d us,\u201d we\u201d and our\u201d refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis.\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank ( Centennial\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $16.40 billion, loans receivable, net of $10.98 billion, total deposits of $12.73 billion, and stockholders' equity of $2.61 billion.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and FHLB borrowed funds are our primary source of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our net interest margin, return on average assets and return on average common equity. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP). The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain items such as merger expenses, hurricane expenses and/or gains and losses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of or for the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,398,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,032,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,302,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,220,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,869,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,071,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (245,473\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102,122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,725,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,278,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,899,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total stockholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,605,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,511,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,349,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.02\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average common equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation. \n (2) See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation. \n2020 Overview\nRecent Developments - COVID-19\nThe rapid spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) hit the United States during the first quarter of 2020 and has continued through December 31, 2020. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These actions have had a significant impact on markets driven by supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions, retail closures, and reduced consumer spending and sentiment, amongst other factors. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.\nWhile our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that have been deemed, or who are employed by businesses that have been deemed, to be non-essential. Further, many of our customers that have been categorized to date as essential businesses, or who are employed by businesses that have been categorized as essential businesses, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. We have reopened our banking lobbies in order to serve customers in person, while still offering service through drive-thru tellers as well as electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we continue to support working remotely. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments for certain consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our loan deferrals decreased to $330.7 million on 56 loans from the June 30, 2020 balance of $3.18 billion on 4,209 loans. Of the 56 loans currently on deferment, 51 of our loans totaling $271.1 million chose interest only deferment and now have returned to paying interest monthly, with the majority of these loans having modifications for 18-24 month interest only payments with a return to full principal and interest payments at the end of the modification term. The hospitality sector has been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and represents 52.0% of the deferment balance as of December 31, 2020. The geographic distribution of these deferrals is similar through all of our markets. Our review of deferment requests required updated interim operating statements, balance sheet and liquidity verifications, and validation of the current risk rating.\nIn April 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES\u201d Act) established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses. During 2020, as a participating lender, we have generated 8,702 loans to both existing and new customers. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding PPP loan balances were $691.7 million. The average loan size is $88,000.\nWe also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Our stock price has historically traded above its per share book value and tangible book value (non-GAAP). However, at certain times during 2020, our stock price fell below book value. This drop in stock was in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. During 2020, our common stock traded as low as $9.71 per share; however, our common stock closed on December 31, 2020 at $19.48 per share, which was above book value of $15.78 per share and above tangible book value (non-GAAP) of $9.70 per share. The Company updated its valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2020 based on the drop in the Company's stock price during 2020. However, taking into account the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our local economy, we determined that no impairment charge to goodwill was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition and will reevaluate any impairment of our goodwill should economic or market conditions further deteriorate as a result of the pandemic.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our Shore Premier Finance ( SPF\u201d) division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nTotal interest income decreased $42.0 million, or 5.9%, and non-interest expense increased $28.6 million, or 10.4%. This was offset by a $61.4 million, or 39.6%, decrease in total interest expense and a $12.3 million, or 12.3%, increase in non-interest income. The primary drivers of the decrease in interest income were a $33.0 million decrease in loan interest income, a $5.7 million decrease in investment security income and a $3.3 million decrease in interest income on deposits with other banks. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.0 million increase in occupancy and equipment expense, a $2.9 million increase in data processing expense and an $13.0 million increase in other operating expenses resulting from a $17.0 million increase in our reserve for unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest expense was due to a $51.0 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $7.7 million decrease in interest on FHLB borrowed funds. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $14.8 million increase in mortgage lending income, a $4.8 million increase in dividend income from FHLB, FRB, FNBB and other equity investments, and a $3.8 million increase in other income, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $3.4 million decrease in other service charges and fees and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. Income tax expense decreased by $32.8 million during the year due a reduction in net income as well as $3.7 million in tax expense incurred in the third quarter of 2019 due to the Company surrendering $47.5 million of underperforming separate account bank owned life insurance.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur efficiency ratio was 42.63% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 40.34% for the same period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.36%, an improvement of 19 basis points from the 40.55% reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. (See Table 23 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation).\nOur return on average assets was 1.33% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.93% for the same period in 2019. Our annualized return on average common equity was 8.57% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 12.01% for the same period in 2019.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%. The COVID-19 crisis and the accompanying governmental response has created a tremendous amount of excess liquidity in the market. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $691.7 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $747.0 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders' equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing loans increased to $74.1 million, or 0.66%, of total loans from $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 331.10% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $24.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $17.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $43.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $530,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $429,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing assets increased to $78.6 million, or 0.48%, of total assets from $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $25.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $22.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $46.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $39.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $564,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $463,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market consists of one loan that is assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place this loan on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loan that makes up the total balance is still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place this loan on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\n2019 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5%, and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8%, increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019, the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.42% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The yield on interest earning assets was 5.45% and 5.39% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $12.82 billion to $13.26 billion. The increase in earning assets is primarily the result of our acquisition in June 2018 and an increase in taxable investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $35.9 million and $41.5 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. We recognized $3.3 million in loan payoff events for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we experienced approximately $2.0 million in increased investment premium amortization. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 1.55% and 1.27% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $9.76 billion to $10.02 billion. The reduction in accretion income, decrease in loan payoff events and the increase in investment premium amortization reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur efficiency ratio was 40.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 38.48% for the same period in 2018. For year ended 2019, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.55%, which increased from the 37.64% reported for the year ended 2018 (See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation). The increase in the efficiency ratio is primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in non-interest expense and a $3.3 million decrease in non-interest income which was only partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in net interest income.\nOur return on average assets was 1.93% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2.06% for the same period in 2018. Our return on average common equity was 12.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 13.17% for the same period in 2018.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2019 decreased $270.4 million to $15.03 billion from the $15.30 billion reported as of December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $167.3 million, and our loan portfolio decreased $202.2 million to $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $11.07 billion as of December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased $161.6 million to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $2.35 billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in stockholders' equity is primarily associated with the $204.4 million increase in retained earnings and the $30.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income which were partially offset by the repurchase of $84.9 million of our common stock during 2019. The improvement in stockholders' equity was 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing loans decreased to $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans from $64.2 million, or 0.58%, of total loans as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019, compared to 169.35% as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $17.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $34.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $43.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $429,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $179,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our non-performing assets decreased to $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets from $78.0 million, or 0.51%, of total assets as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $22.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $24.0 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $39.2 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $50.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $463,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $306,000 as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $1.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no non-performing assets from our Centennial CFG franchise.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOverview. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and stock options.\nRevenue Recognition. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:\n \u2022 Service charges on deposit accounts - These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied. \n \u2022 Other service charges and fees - These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial CFG loan fees. The interchange fees are recorded in the period the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts. Centennial CFG loan fees are based on loan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310. Interchange fees were $14.9 million and $14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Centennial CFG loan fees were $8.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. \nCredit Losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company's portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet ( OBS\u201d) credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration ( PCD\u201d) that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield was deemed to be immaterial and was reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption on of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined than an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was not deemed material. However, the Company evaluated the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 and determined that an $842,000 provision for credit losses was necessary. No additional provision was deemed necessary during the remainder of 2020. See Note 3 for further discussion.\nInvestments - Available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nInvestments - Held-to-Maturity. Securities held-to-maturity, which include any security for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity, are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Effective January 1, 2019, as permitted by ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, the Company reclassified the prepayable held-to-maturity ( HTM\u201d) investment securities, with a fair value of $193.6 million and $834,000 in net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2018, to available-for-sale investment securities.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management's intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\n \u2022 1-4 family construction \n \u2022 All other construction \n \u2022 1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit ( HELOC\u201d) & junior liens \n \u2022 1-4 family senior liens \n \u2022 Multifamily \n \u2022 Owner occupies commercial real estate \n \u2022 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate \n \u2022 Commercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other \n \u2022 Consumer auto \n \u2022 Other consumer \n \u2022 Other consumer - SPF \nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies:\n \u2022 Management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower. \n \u2022 The extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. \nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower's financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated ( PCD\u201d) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan's purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures: The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as unfunded commitments expense within non-interest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale. Real estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not\u201d means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined\u201d and upon examination\u201d also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management's judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable.\nStock Compensation. In accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award.\nAcquisitions\nLH-Finance\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People's United Bank, N.A.

We anticipate that our principal acquisition focus will be to continue to expand our presence in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets through pursuing both non-FDIC-assisted and FDIC-assisted bank acquisitions. However, as financial opportunities in other market areas arise, we may seek to expand into those areas.\nWe will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our Company. Our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors.\nBranches\nAs opportunities arise, we will continue to open new (commonly referred to as de novo) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas.\nDuring 2020, we did not open any de novo branches but opened a loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland, under the management of the SPF division in connection with our acquisition of LH-Finance. During 2019, we opened branch locations in Orlando and Hialeah, Florida, and Russellville, Arkansas. We also opened a loan production office in Miami, Florida, during 2019 under the management of Centennial CFG.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 161 branch locations. There were 77 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 have resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded $17.0 million in unfunded commitments expense which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company's unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses. The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our SPF division. The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company's Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.\nOur net income decreased $10.9 million, or 3.62%, to $289.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $300.4 million for the same period in 2018. Total interest expense increased $30.4 million, or 24.5%, non-interest expense increased $11.8 million, or 4.5% and non-interest income decreased $3.3 million or 3.2%. This was partially offset by a $32.6 million, or 4.8% increase in total interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $27.7 million increase in loan interest income. The main components of the decrease in non-interest income were a $2.5 million decrease in other service charges and fees, a $1.6 million decrease in gain (loss) on OREO, net, and a $3.3 million decrease in other income, which was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in dividends from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d), First National Bankers' Bank ( FNBB\u201d) and other dividends and a $1.9 million increase in mortgage lending income. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was a $34.5 million, or 43.4%, increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in non-interest expense was driven by a $10.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits. Income tax expense increased by $965,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.73 per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. While net income decreased $10.9 million, the Company was able achieve a flat earnings per share for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of being active in a share repurchase program. During 2018 and 2019 the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares and 4.5 million shares, respectively.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate (26.135% for the year ended December 31, 2020, 25.819% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 26.135% for year ended December 31, 2018).\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Funds target rate, which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds, increased four times in 2018. First, the target rate was increased to 1.50% to 1.75% on March 21, 2018; second, the rate was increased on June 13, 2018 to 1.75% to 2.00%; third, the rate was increased on September 26, 2018 to 2.00% to 2.25%; and fourth, the rate was increased on December 19, 2018 to 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December 31, 2020, which has decreased from the target rate of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.02% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The yield on interest earning assets was 4.65% and 5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.66 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $666.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market. As a result, we had an increase of $666.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 19 basis points. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This lowered the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 27 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $20.1 million, or 3.5%, to $588.6"}
