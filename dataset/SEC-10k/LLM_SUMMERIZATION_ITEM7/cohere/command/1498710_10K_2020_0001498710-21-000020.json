MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is included herein. Unless expressly stated otherwise, for discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2018 items and fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n2020 Year in Review\nWe experienced healthy passenger booking and revenue trends for the first two months of 2020 and year-over-year increases that were in line with our expectations. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year, and we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and capacity reductions. As a result, our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by this reduction in air travel demand.\nWith the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. Load factor for 2020 was 69.7% as compared to 84.4% for the prior year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a decrease in operating revenues of 52.7%, year over year, and a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability.\nWe have implemented measures for the safety of our Guests and Team Members as well as to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our financial position and operations.\nCaring for Guests and Team Members\nOur Operations and Task Force teams remain in constant contact with authorities, continuing to evolve its response to ensure the safety of Guests and Team Members. In addition to previously existing procedures including utilization of hospital-grade disinfectants and state-of-the-art HEPA filters that capture 99.97% of airborne particles on board the aircraft, we have implemented and continued the following steps to protect our Guests and Team Members:\n\u2022Secured and distributed additional supplies of gloves and sanitizer across our network and augmented the contents of onboard supply kits to contain additional cleaning and sanitizing materials;\n\u2022Secured and provided face coverings for all crew and Guest facing team members;\n\u2022Required all Guests to complete a Health Acknowledgement at check-in;\n\u2022Expanded cleaning protocols at airports and other facilities, including the use of EPA-registered disinfectants in all check-in and gate areas and the use of electrostatic sprayers at high-traffic airports;\n\u2022Expanded aircraft turn and overnight cleaning protocols focusing on high frequency touch points as well as enhanced cockpit cleaning and the use of ultra-low volume (\"ULV\") fogging process to apply a safe, high-grade EPA-registered airborne disinfectant that is effective against coronaviruses;\n\u2022Launched a new antimicrobial fogging tool in our facilities and aircraft that uses a product that forms an invisible barrier on all surfaces killing bacteria and viruses on contact for 30 days;\n\u2022Split the Company's Operational Control Center (\"OCC\") into multiple units to enable social distancing and prepared the OCC to work remotely to minimize potential operational disruption;\n\u2022Implemented a remote work policy for the Support Center teams to maintain support of our operations;\n\u2022Automated the Team Member screening process upon entry to all Company-operated facilities by installing an automatic temperature scanner which is activated and monitored 24 hours a day;\n\u2022Required all Guests and Guest-facing Team Members to wear an appropriate face covering when traveling through the airport or onboard aircraft;\n\u2022Limited face to face interaction through automated baggage systems and biometric photo-matching check in;\n\u2022Offered future flight credits with extended expiration dates to Guests with impacted travel plans and waived change and cancellation fees for Guests who booked travel to occur by February 28, 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we will evaluate any continued impact to travel plans and may decide to further extend credit shell expiration dates and/or waive change and cancellation fees in the future.\nSupporting Communities\nDuring this unprecedented time, many travelers have been stranded abroad with bans and other restrictions on travel implemented globally and domestically. We worked with embassies and local governments in Aruba, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, St. Martin and the U.S. to operate special flights for stranded travelers in such countries. During 2020, we provided over 260 flights to more than 30,000 stranded travelers. In addition, during 2020, we pledged $250,000 in vouchers for flights to U.S. organizations advocating for social justice and civil rights.\nWe have also made efforts to address the growing needs of its communities through The Spirit Airlines Charitable Foundation (the Foundation\u201d). As part of the its focus on supporting families, the Foundation partnered with other non-profit organizations including the YMCA and Jack and Jill Children's Center to provide food to seniors and families struggling during this time and supported organizations creating face coverings for healthcare workers. In addition, we have partnered to offer Guests face coverings for a small contribution to the Red Cross.\nCapacity Reductions\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, in response to government restrictions on travel and drastically reduced consumer demand, we began to significantly reduce capacity each month with the largest capacity reduction in May 2020 at approximately 94%, year over year. In response to modest demand recovery, we strategically added back capacity during certain peak travel periods. During the holiday months of November and December, capacity was reduced to a lesser extent with reductions of 20.8% and 20.1%, year over year. We continue to closely monitor demand and will make adjustments to the flight schedule as appropriate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to evolve with recent developments including the uptick in the rate of infections following the 2020 holiday season, the emergency use authorization issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certain COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, and the requirement, effective January 26, 2021, that all U.S. inbound international travelers provide a negative COVID-19 test prior to flying. We currently estimate that air travel demand will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months as the lingering effects of COVID-19 continue to develop. We expect that air travel demand will continue to gradually recover in 2021. However, the situation continues to be fluid and actual capacity adjustments may be different than what we currently expect. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation\" for discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our air traffic liability, credit shells and refunds.\nCOVID-19 Legislation\nOn March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") into law. The CARES Act was a relief package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants to be used for employee salaries, wages and benefits and up to $25 billion in secured loans.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") Agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury (\"Treasury\"), pursuant to which we received a total of $344.4 million, used exclusively to pay for salaries, wages and benefits for our Team Members through September 30, 2020. Of that amount, $73.3 million is in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with its participation in the PSP, we issued to Treasury warrants pursuant to a warrant agreement to purchase up to 520,797 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $14.08 per share (the closing price for the shares of our common stock on April 9, 2020) with a fair value of $3.9 million. The remaining amount of $267.2 million is in the form of a grant and was recognized in special charges and credits, net of related costs, in our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nPursuant to the warrant agreement with the Treasury, we registered the resale of the warrants and the 520,797 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants in September and October 2020. Total warrants issued represent less\nthan 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on the notes issued and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for additional information on the warrants.\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP, we were, and continue to be, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through September 30, 2021;\n\u2022Limits on certain executive compensation including limiting pay increases and severance pay or other benefits upon terminations, through March 24, 2022;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services (including to destinations where there may currently be significantly reduced or no demand) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on involuntary terminations or furloughs of our employees (except for health, disability, cause, or certain disciplinary reasons) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on reducing the salaries, wages, or benefits of our employees (other than our executive officers or independent contractors, or as otherwise permitted under the terms of the PSP) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Limitations on the use of the grant funds exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; and\n\u2022Additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements relating to the CARES Act funds.\nOn April 29, 2020, we applied for additional funds under the Treasury's loan program under the CARES Act ( Loan Program\u201d). On July 1, 2020, we executed a non-binding letter of intent with the Treasury which summarized the principal terms of the financing request submitted by us to the Treasury. In September 2020, we decided that we would not participate in the Treasury's loan program as we were able to secure other forms of financing described below.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. This new legislation provides an extension or additional benefits designed to address the continuing economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill extends the PSP program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021 (\"PSP2\") and provides an additional $15 billion to fund the PSP2 program for employees of passenger air carriers. In late December, we notified the Treasury of our intent to participate in the PSP2 agreement. We entered into a new payroll support program agreement with Treasury on January 15, 2021. We expect to receive approximately $184.5 million pursuant to our participation in the PSP2 program. In January 2021, we received the first installment of $92.2 million in the form of a grant. Of the remaining amount, we expect that approximately $25 million will be in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with our participation in the PSP2, we expect to issue to Treasury warrants to purchase up to 103,761 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $24.42 (the closing price of the shares of our common stock on December 24, 2020).\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP2, we are subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through March 31, 2022;\n\u2022Limits on executive compensation through October 1, 2022;\n\u2022Restrictions from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until March 31, 2021;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services through March 1, 2022;\n\u2022Reporting requirements; and\n\u2022A recall of all employees that were involuntarily furloughed or terminated between October 1, 2020 and the date the carrier enters into the new payroll support agreement with the Treasury. Such employees, if returning to work, must be compensated for lost pay and benefits between December 1, 2020 and the date of such new payroll support agreement.\nThe CARES Act also provided an employee retention credit ( CARES Employee Retention credit\u201d) which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to $5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The credit is equal to 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, capped at $10,000 of qualified wages through year end. We qualified for the credit beginning on April 1, 2020 and received additional credits for qualified wages through December 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $38.5 million related to the CARES Employee Retention credit within special charges (credits) on our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 also extends and expands the availability of the CARES Employee Retention credit through June 30, 2021, however, certain provisions apply only after December 31, 2020. This new legislation amends the employee retention credit to be equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees after December 31, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. During the first two quarters of 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee per calendar quarter may be counted in determining the 70% credit. Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer in 2021 is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter for the first and second quarters of 2021.\nThe CARES Act also provides for certain tax loss carrybacks and a waiver on federal fuel taxes through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had recognized $142.0 million in federal related tax loss carrybacks and $6.5 million in federal fuel tax savings reflected within aircraft fuel in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFinally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred $23.2 million in social security tax payments. The deferred amounts are recorded within other current liabilities and within deferred gains and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 30.9% compared to 23.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax rate, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to a $56.1 million discrete federal tax benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to the passage of the CARES Act. The CARES Act allows for carryback of net operating losses generated at a 21% tax rate to recover taxes paid at a 35% tax rate. Excluding this discrete tax benefit, our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 would have been 21.8%. While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-17, Income Taxes\" for additional information.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity\nSince the onset of the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2020, we have taken several actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. As a result of these actions, as of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities of $1,896.1 million.\nIn March 2020, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"2022 revolving credit facility\") for an initial commitment amount of $110.0 million, and subsequently, in the second quarter of 2020, increased its commitment amount to $180.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had fully drawn the available amount of $180.0 million under the 2022 revolving credit facility. The 2022 revolving credit facility matures on March 30, 2022. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our 2022 revolving credit facility.\nOn May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the convertible notes\u201d). The convertible notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per year and will mature on May 15, 2025. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020. We received proceeds of $168.3 million, net of total issuance costs of $6.7 million, and recorded $95.6 million in long-term debt and finance leases, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million, on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the debt component of our convertible notes, and $72.7 million in additional paid-in-capital (\"APIC\"), net of issuance costs of $2.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the equity component of the convertible notes. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our convertible debt.\nAlso on May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of 20,125,000 shares of our voting common stock, which includes full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,625,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $10.00 per share (the common stock offering\u201d). We received proceeds of $192.4 million, net of issuance costs of $8.9 million. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information on our common stock offering.\nIn June 2020, we entered into an agreement to amend our revolving credit facility entered into in 2018 to finance aircraft pre-delivery payments. The agreement amends the revolving credit facility to extend the final maturity date from December 30, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Upon execution of the amended agreement, the maximum borrowing capacity decreased from\n$160.0 million to $111.2 million. This facility is secured by the collateral assignment of certain of our rights under the purchase agreement with Airbus. As of December 31, 2020, collateralized amounts were related to 11 Airbus A320neo aircraft scheduled to be delivered between June 2021 and April 2022. The maximum borrowing capacity of $95.1 million, as of December 31, 2020, decreased from $111.2 million due to the delivery of aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and will continue to decrease as we take delivery of the related aircraft. The amendment provides approximately $54 million in additional liquidity through March 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nAlso, in June 2020, we entered into an agreement to defer certain aircraft deliveries originally scheduled in 2020 and 2021, as well as the related pre-delivery deposit payments. We may elect to supplement these deliveries by additional acquisitions from the manufacturer or in the open market if demand conditions merit. We also may adjust or defer deliveries, or change models of aircraft in our delivery stream, from time to time, as a means to match our future capacity with anticipated demand and growth trends. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took delivery of 12 aircraft. In addition, the Company has 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-18, Commitments and Contingencies\" for further information on our future aircraft deliveries.\nOn July 22, 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement relating to the issuance and sale from time to time of up to 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). During the third quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of all 9,000,000 shares under our \"at-the-market offering\" program (\"ATM program\") and had received proceeds of $156.7 million, net of $5.0 million in related issuance costs. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information.\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced the completion of the private offering by Spirit IP Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company of an aggregate of $850 million principal amount of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 (the 8.00% senior secured notes\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes are guaranteed by the Company, Spirit Finance Cayman 1 Ltd. ( HoldCo 1\u201d), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Finance Cayman 2 Ltd., a direct subsidiary of HoldCo 1 and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( HoldCo 2\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes will be secured by, among other things, a first priority lien on the core assets of the Company's loyalty programs, comprised of cash proceeds from its Free Spirit co-branded credit card programs, its $9 Fare ClubTM program membership fees, and certain intellectual property required or necessary to operate the loyalty programs, as well as the Company's brand intellectual property. Refer to Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation, for further information on the Company's loyalty programs. The 8.00% senior secured notes will mature on September 20, 2025. The 8.00% senior secured notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum, payable in quarterly installments on January 20, April 20, July 20 and October 20 of each year, beginning January 20, 2021. We received proceeds of $823.9 million, net of issuance costs of $17.4 million and original issue discount of $8.7 million, related to this private offering. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nIn addition, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional action, including:\n\u2022Reduced planned discretionary non-aircraft capital spend in 2020 by approximately $70 million;\n\u2022Deferred approximately $25 million in heavy maintenance events from 2020 to 2021;\n\u2022Reduced planned non-fuel operating costs for 2020 by approximately $30 million, excluding savings related to reduced capacity;\n\u2022Suspended hiring across the Company except to fill essential roles;\n\u2022Entered into agreements to defer payments in 2020 related to facility rents and other airport services contracts at certain locations;\n\u2022Entered into agreements with lessors to temporarily defer aircraft rent payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with service providers to temporarily defer maintenance and service contract payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with unionized and non-unionized employees to create voluntary leave programs;\n\u2022Continued to pursue additional financing secured by its unencumbered assets.\nWe continue to engage in discussions with our significant stakeholders and vendors regarding financial support or contract adjustments, including extensions of payment terms, during this transition period.\nFor purposes of assessing our liquidity needs, we estimate that demand will continue to be volatile as we recover through 2021, but remain well below 2019 levels. We believe the actions described above, along with the expected funds of the PSP2 program, sufficiently address our future liquidity needs. However, we anticipate we may implement further discretionary changes, cost reduction and liquidity preservation and/or enhancement measures, as needed, to address the volatility and\nchanging dynamics of passenger demand and the impact of revenue changes, regulatory and public health directives and prevailing government policy and financial market conditions.\nWorkforce Actions\nIn July 2020, we distributed a letter to employees, including approximately 2,500 U.S.-based union represented employees, regarding the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, we worked with unionized employees and the related unions to create voluntary leave programs for pilots, flight attendants and other unionized employee groups. We also created voluntary leave programs for certain non-unionized employee groups. In August 2020, we announced a voluntary separation program for non-unionized employees. Due to the high level of support and acceptance of the voluntary programs offered, no unionized employees were involuntarily furloughed and the total number of non-unionized employees involuntarily separated as of October 1, 2020 was reduced by more than 95%. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $2.5 million in expenses related to the voluntary and involuntary employee separations. These expenses were recorded within special credits (charges) on our consolidated statement of operations. Expenses related to voluntary leave programs were recorded within salaries, wages and benefits on our consolidated statement of operations. With our expected participation in the PSP2 program, we will comply with any related restrictions and limitations on any workforce actions.\nSummary of Results\nDuring 2020, we had a net loss of $428.7 million ($5.06 per share, diluted), compared to a net income of $335.3 million ($4.89 per share, diluted) in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by a 45.2% decrease in our traffic and a 13.8% decrease in average yield, year over year. Due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we decreased our capacity by 33.7%, as compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the net loss incurred in the period was a $302.8 million special credit recorded within special charges (credits), operating. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a negative operating margin of 28.1% on $1,810.0 million in operating revenues. TRASM in 2020 was 6.53 cents, a decrease of 28.8% compared to the prior year. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.5%, year over year, from $110.91 to $98.14. Fare revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 24.9% partially offset by a 1.5% increase in non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in total fare revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily due to a decrease of 13.8% in average yield, year over year.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2020, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel increased by 42.2% to 7.89 cents. The increase on a per-ASM basis was primarily due to increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, landing fees and other rents expense and aircraft rent expense on a per-ASM basis. These increases on a per-ASM basis were mostly driven by the semi-fixed nature of many of these costs combined with a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we added 4 new destinations: Barranquilla, Colombia; Bucaramanga, Colombia; Cap-Haitien, Haiti; Orange County, California. During 2020, we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 145 to 157 aircraft as we took delivery of 8 new aircraft financed under secured debt arrangements, 1 aircraft under a sale-leaseback transaction and 3 aircraft under direct operating leases. In addition, we purchased 2 previously leased aircraft. We also took delivery of 2 new engines through cash purchases. As of December 31, 2020, our 157 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 31 A319ceos, 64 A320ceos, 32 A320neos and 30 A321ceos of which 72 aircraft are financed through secured debt, 56 are financed under operating leases, and 29 are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our aircraft orders consisted of 136 A320 family aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2027.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and other revenues.\nPassenger revenues\nFare revenues. Tickets sold are initially deferred within air traffic liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Passenger fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided. Generally, all tickets sold by the Company are nonrefundable. An unused ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue at the date of\nscheduled travel. Fare revenues are recorded within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\"\nNon-fare revenues. Our most significant non-fare revenues generally include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. These ancillary items are deemed part of the single performance obligation of providing passenger transportation and as such, are recognized in non-fare revenues within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\" The majority of our passenger non-fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided.\nPassenger revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and non-fare revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided.\nRevenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program and other loyalty programs are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09. Guests may earn mileage credits based on their spending with the co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations, as discussed below.\nOur co-branded credit card agreement provides for joint marketing where cardholders earn mileage credits for making purchases using co-branded cards. During 2020, we extended our agreement with the administrator of the FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program to extend through March 31, 2024. In connection with the extension of the agreement, in January 2021, we launched a new loyalty program with extended mileage expiration, additional benefits based on status tiers, and other changes. We account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts. The new program terms will require updated estimates of the allocation of future revenues to the performance obligations described above.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of the marketing component of the sale of frequent flyer miles to our credit card partner and commissions revenue from the sale of various items such as hotels and rental cars.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. We recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. Upon collection from the customer, we record a liability within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from activity on our fuel derivatives, if any.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and heavy maintenance. Under the deferral method, the cost of our heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of all minimum lease payments under the terms of our aircraft and spare engine lease agreements recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, aircraft rent expense was net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-15. Leases and Prepaid Maintenance Deposits\u201d for information regarding the Company's accounting policy on sale-leaseback transactions after the adoption of Topic 842. As of December 31, 2020, 56 of our 157 aircraft and 8 of our 24 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors and in-house mechanics required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs, including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets. In addition, subsequent to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, it includes net losses or gains resulting from our aircraft and engine sale-leaseback transactions.\nSpecial Charges (Credits). Special charges and credits include recognition of the grant component of the Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") with the Treasury, the CARES Act Employee Retention credit, amounts paid in connection with our voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs, ratification incentive payouts related to the collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and dispatchers and the write-off of aircraft related credits.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nOther (Income) Expense\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2020 primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft as well as the interest and accretion related to our convertible notes and 8.00% senior secured notes. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft.\nCapitalized Interest. The Company capitalizes the interest that is primarily attributable to the outstanding PDP balances as a percentage of the related debt on which interest is incurred. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of a long-term asset and is the amount which theoretically could have been avoided had we not paid PDPs for the related aircraft or engines. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily relates to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\nInterest Income. For 2020, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as interest earned on income tax refunds. For 2019, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For 2018, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash\nequivalents, short-term investments and on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our Series 2017-1 EETC.\nOther Expense. Other expense primarily includes realized gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Non-operating. We had no special charges, non-operating in 2020 and 2019. For 2018, special charges, non-operating represents interest related to an aircraft purchase agreement for the acquisition of 14 A319 aircraft previously operated under operating leases. The contract was deemed a lease modification which resulted in a change of classification from operating leases to finance leases, until the purchase date of the aircraft. Please see \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nAbility to Execute our Growth Strategy. Over recent years, we have pursued a high-growth strategy, which we expect to continue. Execution of such a strategy requires us to effectively deploy new flying into our network, as new routes or increased frequency of existing routes develop. New flying may not perform as well as expected or may result in a competitive reaction. Moreover, our growth strategy depends on the timely delivery of aircraft and engines in accordance with the intended delivery schedule in accordance with the applicable agreement. Delivery delays, as we have experienced from time to time in recent years, may cause us to scale back our growth, unless we are able to replace delayed aircraft in the secondary market or otherwise. Finally, our growth strategy relies in part on our ability to obtain additional facilities in airports, some of which are constrained, as well as additional flight crew, maintenance, and other personnel. We expect to experience an increase in our compensation expense to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nAbility to Maintain or Grow Capacity. We pursue a high-growth strategy that expands revenue and maintains lower cost due to economies of scale and lower initial expense for aircraft and labor. Execution of such a strategy depends on the ability to maintain efficient utilization of existing capacity and the timely delivery of new aircraft and engines. In recent years, we have experienced aircraft operational reliability and delivery delays particularly regarding our A320neo aircraft. The new generation aircraft provide fuel burn and other efficiencies, as compared to the older A320ceo aircraft, and the ability to serve additional markets with greater operating range. However, ongoing or expanded reliability and delivery issues could materially impact our operations, costs and net results.\nImpact of COVID-19. During 2020, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and refunds. Our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by the reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a significant decrease in capacity and operating revenues, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability. For more detailed information on the impact of COVID-19, please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. Impact of COVID-19.\"\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target\npromotions and frequent flyer initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods in efforts to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nMoreover, the network carriers have developed a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting may have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of high-cost carriers but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of corporate and less price-sensitive travelers. Refer to Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Industry-We operate in an extremely competitive industry.\"\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represents one of our largest operating expenses, as it does for most airlines. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives and we have not engaged in fuel derivative activity since 2015. As of December 31, 2020, we purchased a majority of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have five union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 82% of our employees at December 31, 2020. Our pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association, or PAFCA, our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW, and our passenger service agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union, or TWU. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages.\nDuring 2017, we experienced operational disruption from pilot-related work action which adversely impacted our results. We obtained a temporary restraining order to enjoin further illegal labor action. In January 2018, under the guidance of the NMB assigned mediators, the parties reached a tentative agreement. In February 2018, the pilot group voted to approve the current five-year agreement with us. In connection with the current agreement, we incurred a one-time ratification incentive of $80.2 million, including payroll taxes, and an $8.5 million adjustment related to other contractual provisions. These amounts were recorded in special charges (credits) within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, under the supervision of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight attendants, which becomes amendable May 2021.\nOur dispatchers are represented by the PAFCA. In June 2018, we commenced negotiations with PAFCA for an amended agreement with our dispatchers. In October 2018, PAFCA and the Company reached a tentative agreement for a new five-year agreement, which was ratified by the PAFCA members in October 2018.\nIn July 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms. In June 2016, we reached an agreement on the remaining terms of the collective bargaining agreement. In February 2020, the IAMAW notified us, as required by the Railway Labor Act, that it intends to submit proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement covering our ramp service agents, which became amendable in June 2020. The parties expect to schedule meeting dates for negotiations soon.\nIn June 2018, our passenger service agents voted to be represented by the TWU, but the representation only applies to our Fort Lauderdale station where we have direct employees in the passenger service classification. We began meeting with the TWU in late October 2018 to negotiate an initial collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we continued to negotiate with the TWU.\nWe believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. This law may be repealed in its entirety or certain aspects may be changed or replaced. If the law is repealed or modified or if new legislation is passed, such action could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense generally increases each year mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. However, in 2020, maintenance expense decreased year over year mainly as a result of decreased aircraft utilization due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As our fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time particularly in the current period given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our airline.\nAs a result of a majority of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on certain aircraft will overlap, meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations on certain aircraft at roughly the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods.\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nLoyalty Mileage Credits earned with Co-branded credit card. Customers may earn mileage credits based on their spending with our co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations. The agreement provides for joint marketing and we account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\") for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts.\nWe defer the amount for award travel obligation as part of loyalty deferred revenue within air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily marketing components, is recorded in other revenue as miles are delivered. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash sales from this agreement were $33.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations.\nAircraft Maintenance Deposits. Some of our aircraft and engine master lease agreements provide that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities. These lease agreements generally provide that maintenance reserves are reimbursable to us upon completion of the maintenance event. A majority of these maintenance reserve payments are calculated based on a utilization measure, such as flight hours or cycles, and are used solely to collateralize the lessor for maintenance time run off the aircraft until the completion of the maintenance of the aircraft.\nMaintenance reserve payments are reflected as aircraft maintenance deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We make certain assumptions to determine the recoverability of maintenance deposits. These assumptions are based on various factors such as the estimated time between the maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft is estimated before it is returned to the lessor. When it is not probable we will recover amounts currently on deposit with a lessor, such amounts are expensed as supplemental rent.\nSupplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. We expensed $3.3 million and $4.8 million of supplemental rent recorded within aircraft rent during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We did not expense any paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent in 2020. During 2019, we expensed $0.5 million of paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had aircraft maintenance deposits of $126.3 million and $170.6 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\nLeased Aircraft Return Costs. Our aircraft lease agreements often contain provisions that require us to return aircraft airframes and engines to the lessor in a certain condition or pay an amount to the lessor based on the airframe and engine's actual return condition. Lease return costs include all costs that would be incurred at the return of the aircraft, including costs incurred to repair the airframe and engines to the required condition as stipulated by the lease. Lease return costs are recognized beginning when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated. When costs become both probable and estimable, they are accrued as a component of supplemental rent, through the remaining lease term.\nWhen determining the need to accrue lease return costs, there are various factors which need to be considered such as the contractual terms of the lease agreement, current condition of the aircraft, the age of the aircraft at lease expiration, and projected number of hours run on the engine at the time of return, among others. In addition, typically near the lease return date, the lessors may allow reserves to be applied as return condition consideration or pass on certain return provisions if they do not align with their current plans to remarket the aircraft. As a result of the different factors listed above, management assesses the need to accrue lease return costs periodically throughout the year or whenever facts and circumstances warrant an assessment.\nLease return costs will generally be estimable closer to the end of the lease term but may be estimable earlier in the lease term depending on the contractual terms of the lease agreement and the timing of maintenance events for a particular aircraft. As a result of COVID-19, we are currently operating our aircraft at lower utilization levels. If we continue flying our aircraft at lower utilization levels beyond our current projections, the timing of future maintenance events may change such that we will be required to accrue lease return costs and/or record reserves against our maintenance deposits earlier than we would have expected and such amounts could be significant. We expect lease return costs and unrecoverable maintenance deposits will increase as individual aircraft lease agreements approach their respective termination dates and we begin to accrue the estimated cost of return conditions for the corresponding aircraft. Upon a termination of the lease due to a breach by us, we would be liable for standard contractual damages, possibly including damages suffered by the lessor in connection with remarketing the aircraft or while the aircraft is not leased to another party.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2020, we generated operating revenues of $1,810.0 million and had an operating loss of $507.8 million resulting in a negative operating margin of 28.1% and a net loss of $428.7 million. In 2019, we generated operating revenues of $3,830.5 million and operating income of $501.0 million resulting in a 13.1% operating margin and net income of $335.3 million. The decrease in operating revenues, year over year, is primarily due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March and continuing through the remainder of the year. The length and severity of the reduction in air travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain. We expect air travel demand recovery will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months until the global pandemic has moderated and demand for air travel returns.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents was $1,789.7 million, an increase of $810.8 million compared to the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents is generally driven by cash from our operating activities offset by cash used to fund PDPs and capital expenditures. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mostly driven by cash provided from financing activities primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and warrants as well as funds received in connection with the PSP. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2020, we had $106.3 million in short-term investment securities.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% change 2020 versus 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fare (thousands) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>756,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,886,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-fare (thousands) </td> <td>1,009,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,870,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger (thousands) </td> <td>1,765,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>3,757,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (thousands) </td> <td>44,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>72,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue (thousands) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,810,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.7)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,830,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue per ASM (TRASM) (cents) </td> <td>6.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fare revenue per passenger flight segment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment </td> <td>57.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>56.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue per passenger flight segment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenues decreased by $2,020.5 million, or 52.7%, to $1,810.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in traffic of 45.2%, and a decrease in average yield of 13.8%, year over year, driven by reduced air travel demand as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTRASM for 2020 was 6.53 cents, a decrease of 28.8% compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily a result of a 13.8% decrease in operating yields and a load factor decrease of 14.7 percentage points, year over year.\nTotal revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.5% from $110.91 in 2019 to $98.14 in 2020. Fare revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 24.9% and non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment increased 1.5%. The decrease in fare revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily due to a decrease of 13.8% in average yield, year over year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, breakage, brand-related and other revenues (typically not directly driven by the number of passenger flight segments) as a percentage of total revenue was 14.1%, as compared to 8.8% for the same period in prior year. Breakage revenue is comprised of estimated unredeemed flight credits that expired unused, no-show revenue, and cancellation fees. Brand-related revenue is comprised of revenues associated with $9 Fare ClubTM membership and the marketing component of our co-branded credit card revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSince adopting our ULCC model, we have continuously sought to reduce our unit operating costs and have created one of the industry's lowest cost structures in the United States. The table below presents our unit operating costs (CASM) and year-over-year changes.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

expenses decreased by $1,011.7 million, or 30.4%, in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in operations as reflected by a 33.7% reduction in capacity, as compared to the prior year.\nOur adjusted CASM ex fuel for 2020 increased by 42.2% as compared to 2019. The increase on a per-ASM basis was primarily due to increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, landing fees and other rents expense and aircraft rent expense on a per-ASM basis. These increases on a per-ASM basis were mostly driven by the semi-fixed nature of many of these costs combined with a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAircraft fuel expenses includes both into-plane expense (as defined below) and realized and unrealized net gains or losses from fuel derivatives, if any. Into-plane fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, including taxes and fees. Into-plane fuel prices are affected by the global oil market, refining costs, transportation taxes and fees, which can vary by region in the United States and other countries where we operate. Into-plane fuel expense approximates cash paid to the supplier and does not reflect the effect of any fuel derivatives. We had no activity related to fuel derivative instruments during 2020 and 2019.\nAircraft fuel expense decreased by 56.6% from $993.5 million in 2019 to $431.0 million in 2020. This decrease was due to a 38.5% decrease in fuel gallons consumed, primarily driven by a 36.1% decrease in block hours, and a 29.4% decrease in fuel price per gallon.\nThe elements of the changes in aircraft fuel expense are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed </td> <td>289,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel cost per gallon </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense (per consolidated statements of operations) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>431,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>993,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGulf Coast Jet indexed fuel is the basis for a substantial majority of our fuel consumption and is impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as increases or decreases in refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel.\nLabor costs in 2020 increased by $44.8 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a 8.9% increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., resulting from an increase to our aircraft fleet of 12 aircraft in 2020. In March 2020, we suspended hiring across the Company except to fill essential roles. On both a dollar and per-ASM basis, labor costs increased due to the rate increase our pilots received in connection with the collective bargaining agreement that became effective on March 1, 2018 and which provides for annual increases on each anniversary of the effective date. Additionally, the increase on a per-ASM basis was partially due to a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, as compared to the same period in prior year. In addition, beginning March 2020, we paid salaries and wages to our unionized employees at a guaranteed volume greater than what we actually operated due to the reduced demand resulting from COVID-19, and the requirements of the PSP under the CARES Act. For more detailed information on the impact of COVID-19, please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. Impact of COVID-19.\"\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $53.3 million, or 23.7%, compared to the prior year. The increase in depreciation expense on both a dollar and per-ASM basis was primarily due to the purchase of 8 new aircraft and the purchase of 2 previously leased aircraft during 2020. Since depreciation and amortization expense is generally a fixed cost, the decrease in capacity of 33.7% compared to the prior year period also impacted the increase on a per-ASM basis.\nLanding fees and other rents for 2020 decreased by $5.2 million, or 2.0%, compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in landing fees and overfly fees driven by a 36.5% decrease in departures as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on air travel demand. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in facility rent and gate charges as well as a decrease in signatory adjustment credits received, as compared to the prior year. This decrease in signatory adjustment credits, year over year, is due to airports recovering operating losses from lower utilization fees as well as increased market share at certain airports where other airlines have decreased flying due to the impact of COVID-19 on air travel demand.\nAircraft rent expense in 2020 increased by $13.8 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2019. The increase in aircraft rent expense was primarily driven by an increase in the number of aircraft financed under operating leases throughout 2020, as compared to the prior year. During 2020, we have acquired 4 new aircraft financed under operating leases. The increases generated by the new leased aircraft were partially offset by the purchase of 2 aircraft off lease during 2020. On a per-ASM basis, aircraft rent expense also increased due to a change in the composition of our aircraft fleet between leased aircraft (for which rent expense is recorded under aircraft rent) and purchased aircraft (for which depreciation expense is recorded under depreciation and amortization). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we took delivery of eight new purchased aircraft, which increased capacity but had no effect on aircraft rent expense, as these assets were purchased and are being depreciated over their useful life.\nWe account for heavy maintenance under the deferral method. Under the deferral method, the cost of heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations until the earlier of the next heavy maintenance event or end of the lease term. The amortization of heavy maintenance costs was $88.9 million and $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in amortization of heavy maintenance was primarily due to the timing and number of maintenance events in the current year, as compared to the prior year. This increase in heavy maintenance amortization also contributed to the per-ASM increase in depreciation and amortization expense, year over year. As our fleet continues to age, we expect that the amount of deferred\nheavy maintenance events will increase and will result in an increase in the amortization of those costs. If heavy maintenance events were amortized within maintenance, materials and repairs expense in the consolidated statements of operations, our maintenance, materials and repairs expense would have been $200.2 million and $206.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDistribution expense decreased by $68.7 million, or 44.7%, in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease on a dollar and per-ASM basis was primarily due to decreased sales volume as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on air travel demand which impacts our variable distribution costs such as credit card fees and GDS fees.\nThe following table shows our distribution channel usage:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Website </td> <td>68.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>66.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party travel agents </td> <td>25.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Call center </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased by $32.3 million, or 22.5%, in 2020, as compared to 2019. This decrease is mainly due to fewer aircraft maintenance events as a result of lower utilization in the current year compared to the prior year as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on air travel demand. On a per-ASM basis, the increase is primarily related to a decrease in capacity of 33.7% with no associated decrease in the fixed maintenance, material and repairs costs.\nLoss on disposal of assets totaled $2.3 million for the year ended 2020. This loss on disposal of assets mainly consists of $1.5 million related to the write-off of certain unrecoverable costs previously capitalized with a project to upgrade our enterprise accounting software which was subsequently suspended and $0.8 million related to the disposal of excess and obsolete inventory. Loss on disposal of assets totaled $17.4 million for the year ended 2019. This loss consisted of $13.4 million related to the disposal of excess and obsolete inventory, $3.1 million related to the write-down of certain held-for-sale assets to fair value less cost to sell and $2.4 million related to the write-off of certain unrecoverable costs previously capitalized with the project to upgrade our enterprise accounting software which was subsequently suspended. These losses on disposal of assets were partially offset by a $1.5 million gain on sale leaseback transactions for 6 aircraft delivered during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSpecial charges (credits) for the year ended 2020 consisted of a $266.8 million credit of deferred salaries, wages and benefits, net of the related costs, recognized in connection with the grant component of the PSP with the Treasury and $38.5 million related to the CARES Employee Retention credit. These special credits were partially offset by $2.5 million in special charges recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 related to our voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs. For additional information, refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits.\" Special charges (credits) for the year ended ended 2019 consisted of a $0.7 million write-off of aircraft related credits resulting from the exchange of credits negotiated under the new purchase agreement with Airbus executed during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOther operating expenses in 2020 decreased by $136.2 million, or 27.7%, compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in overall operations as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on air travel demand. As compared to the prior year, departures decreased by 36.5% and we had 46.6% less passenger flight segments, which drove decreases in other variable operating expenses. In addition, we had lower passenger reaccommodation expense, year over year, due to fewer storm-related flight disruptions during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther (income) expense, net increased from $64.6 million in 2019 to $112.4 million in 2020 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense of $33.2 million which primarily consisted of interest related to the financing of purchased aircraft as well as the interest and accretion related to our convertible notes and 8.00% senior secured notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 72 and 64 purchased aircraft financed through secured long-term debt arrangements, respectively. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-14. Debt and Other Obligations\u201d for additional information. In addition, the increase in other (income) expense was attributed to a decrease in interest income of $18.8 million primarily due lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest of $3.5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2020, our effective tax rate was 30.9% compared to 23.2% in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the tax benefit of the federal net operating loss carry back filed in 2020. While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates.\nQuarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Therefore, our financial and operational outlook still remains subject to change and fluctuation. We continue to monitor the impacts of the pandemic on our liquidity and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve cash and protect our long-term sustainability. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken, and are continuing to take, certain actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. Please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. Impact of COVID-19,\" \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 11. Common Stock and Preferred Stock,\" and \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14. Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on the PSP and the measures we have implemented to focus on the safety of our Guests and employees as well as the impact on our liquidity, financial position and operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,896.1 million in liquid assets comprised of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities.\nGenerally, our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash provided by operations and capital from debt and equity financing. Primary uses of liquidity are for working capital needs, capital expenditures, aircraft and engine pre-delivery deposit payments and debt and lease obligations and maintenance reserves. Our total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 was $1,789.7 million, an increase of $810.8 million from December 31, 2019. In addition to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2020, we had $106.3 million in short-term investment securities. We expect to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months primarily with cash and cash equivalents, financing arrangements and funds to be received in connection with the PSP2.\nRefer to the section Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity\u201d within our Year in Review above for further information about actions we have taken to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions include the private offering of $850 million of the 8.00% senior secured notes, the public offering of $175.0 million in convertible notes, the public offering of 20,125,000 shares of our voting common stock for which we received net proceeds of $192.4 million, the issuance and sale of 9,000,000 shares of our voting common stock through our ATM Program for which we received net proceeds of $156.7 million and the execution of a revolving credit facility with a total commitment of $180.0 million as of December 31, 2020, among others. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we made $84.8 million in debt payments (principal, interest and fees) on our outstanding non-aircraft debt obligations. Refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 11. Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" and \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 14. Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $109.0 million recorded within current maturities of long-term debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheets related to our convertible debt. As of December 31, 2020, the convertible notes may be converted by noteholders through March 31, 2021. No notes were converted during the year ended December 31, 2020. Upon conversion and at our election, we may satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in either cash or shares of our common stock.\nCurrently, one of our largest capital expenditure needs is funding the acquisition costs of our aircraft. Aircraft are acquired through debt financing, cash purchases, direct leases or sale leaseback transactions. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 8 aircraft through debt financing transactions and made $261.7 million in debt payments (principal, interest and fees) on our outstanding aircraft debt obligations. The debt entered into during the current year solely to finance aircraft acquisition costs has maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2032 and interest rates ranging from 1.90% to 3.32%. During 2020, we entered into 1 new aircraft sale leaseback transaction. In addition, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took delivery of 3 aircraft financed through direct operating leases and purchased 2 aircraft previously financed under operating leases. We also purchased 2 spare engines through cash purchases.\nUnder our agreements with Airbus for aircraft, and International Aero Engines AG (\"IAE\") and Pratt & Whitney for engines, we are required to pay PDPs relating to future deliveries at various times prior to each delivery date. During 2020, we paid $143.2 million in PDPs, net of refunds, and $12.2 million of capitalized interest for future deliveries of aircraft and spare engines. As of December 31, 2020, we had $356.3 million of pre-delivery deposits on flight equipment, including capitalized interest, on our consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had secured financing for 10 aircraft to be leased directly from third-party lessors, scheduled for delivery in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have financing commitments in place for the 126 Airbus firm aircraft orders, scheduled for delivery through 2027. However, we have signed a financing letter of agreement with Airbus which provides backstop financing for a majority of the aircraft included in the A320 NEO Family Purchase Agreement. The agreement provides a standby credit facility in the form of senior secured mortgage debt financing. Future aircraft deliveries\nmay be paid in cash, leased or otherwise financed based on market conditions, our prevailing level of liquidity, and capital market availability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were compliant with our credit card processing agreements, and not subject to any credit card holdbacks. The maximum potential exposure to cash holdbacks by our credit card processors, based upon advance ticket sales and $9 Fare ClubTM memberships, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was $423.7 million and $342.3 million, respectively.\nNet Cash Flows Provided (Used) By Operating Activities. Operating activities in 2020 used $225.3 million in cash compared to $551.3 million provided in 2019. Cash provided by operating activities decreased, year over year, primarily due to a net loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we had decreases in income tax receivable, deferred income tax expense and deferred heavy maintenance, net, offset by increases in accounts receivable, net, and air traffic liability, as well as a higher non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization, as compared to the prior year. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, we may continue to experience negative cash flows from operations.\nOperating activities in 2019 provided $551.3 million in cash compared to $506.5 million provided in 2018. Cash provided by operating activities increased, year over year, primarily due to higher net income year over year. In addition, we had higher non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and deferred income tax expense, as compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in cash provided by income tax receivable, year over year, as we had a decrease of $69.8 million income tax receivable during 2018 as compared to an increase in income tax receivable of $21.0 million recorded during 2019. In addition, there was a decrease in cash, year over year, provided by other working capital accounts.\nNet Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. During 2020, investing activities used $554.0 million, compared to $456.9 million used in 2019. The increase was mainly due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment, year over year, as well as an increase in PDPs paid, net of refunds, driven by timing of future aircraft deliveries.\nDuring 2019, investing activities used $456.9 million, compared to $783.7 million used in 2018. This decrease was mainly driven by a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment, year over year, as well as a decrease in PDPs paid, net of refunds, driven by timing of future aircraft deliveries.\nNet Cash Provided (Used) By Financing Activities. During 2020, financing activities provided $1,661.4 million. We received $1,585.7 million, net of issuance costs, primarily related to the debt financing of 8 aircraft delivered during 2020, the revolving credit facilities, the unsecured term loan in connection with the PSP, the issuance of convertible notes and the issuance of the 8.00% senior secured notes. In addition, during 2020, we received an additional $353.0 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the issuance of common stock and issuance of warrants in connection with the PSP. We paid $254.3 million in debt principal payment obligations and $25.4 million in finance lease obligations. The payments on finance lease obligations were primarily related to an aircraft purchase agreement for the purchase of two A319 aircraft. Refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 15. Leases and Prepaid Maintenance Deposits\" for more information on these two aircraft.\nDuring 2019, financing activities used $120.2 million. We received $225.9 million primarily related to the debt financing of 4 aircraft delivered during 2019. In addition, we paid $246.8 million in debt principal payment obligations and $96.5 million in finance lease obligations. The payments on finance lease obligations are primarily related to an aircraft purchase agreement for the purchase of four A320ceo aircraft which were previously financed under operating leases.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual purchase commitments consist primarily of aircraft and engine acquisitions through manufacturers and aircraft leasing companies. As of December 31, 2020, our firm aircraft orders consisted of 126 A320 family aircraft with Airbus, including A319neos, A320neos and A321neos, with deliveries expected through 2027. In addition, we had 10 direct operating leases for A320neos with third-party lessors, with deliveries expected through 2021.\nOn December 20, 2019, we entered into an A320 NEO Family Purchase Agreement with Airbus for the purchase of 100 new Airbus A320neo family aircraft, with options to purchase up to 50 additional aircraft. This agreement includes a mix of Airbus A319neo, A320neo and A321neo aircraft with such aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2027. We also have one spare engine order for a V2500 SelectTwo engine with IAE and two spare engine orders for PurePower PW 1100G-JM engines with Pratt & Whitney. Spare engines are scheduled for delivery from 2021 through 2023. As of December 31, 2020, committed expenditures for these aircraft and spare engines, including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and aircraft PDPs, are expected to be $415.7 million in 2021, $849.1 million in 2022, $676.0 million in 2023, $1,001.6 million in 2024, $1,209.1 million in 2025, and $2,367.8 million in 2026 and beyond. During the third quarter of 2019, the United States\nannounced its decision to levy tariffs on certain imports from the European Union, including commercial aircraft and related parts. These tariffs include aircraft and other parts that we are already contractually obligated to purchase including those reflected above. The imposition of these tariffs may substantially increase the cost of new Airbus aircraft and parts required to service our Airbus fleet. For further discussion on this topic, please refer to \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Any tariffs imposed on commercial aircraft and related parts imported from outside the United States may have a material adverse effect on our fleet, business, financial condition and our results of operations.\"\nWe have significant obligations for aircraft and spare engines as 56 of our aircraft and 8 of our spare engines are financed under operating leases. These leases expire between 2022 and 2038. Aircraft rent payments were $172.0 million and $181.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft and engines, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the periods in which payments are due (in millions):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 - 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 - 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 and beyond </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee commitments (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>2,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flight equipment purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>6,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,368 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3) </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total future payments on contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,775 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes principal only associated with our 8.00% senior secured notes, senior term loans, fixed-rate loans, unsecured term loans, Class A, Class B, and Class C Series 2015-1 EETCs, Class AA, Class A, Class B, and Class C Series 2017-1 EETCs, convertible notes and our revolving credit facilities.

Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-18. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nSome of our master lease agreements require that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our required performance of major maintenance activities. Some maintenance reserve payments are fixed contractual amounts, while others are based on utilization.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had secured financing for 10 aircraft to be leased directly from third-party lessors, scheduled for delivery in 2021. We did not have financing commitments in place for the 126 Airbus aircraft currently on firm order, which are scheduled for delivery through 2027. However, we have signed a financing letter of agreement with Airbus which provides backstop financing for a majority of the aircraft included in the A320 NEO Family Purchase Agreement. The agreement provides a standby credit facility in the form of senior secured mortgage debt financing.\nAs of December 31, 2020, aircraft rent commitments for future aircraft deliveries to be financed under direct leases from third-party lessors are expected to be approximately $18.1 million in 2021, $34.2 million in 2022, $34.2 million in 2023, $34.2 million in 2024, $34.2 million in 2025, and $255.5 million in 2026 and beyond. These future commitments are not included in the table above.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased an 8.5-acre parcel of land for $41.0 million and entered into a 99-year lease agreement for the lease of a 2.6-acre parcel of land, in Dania Beach, Florida, where we intend to build a new headquarters campus. Operating lease commitments related to this lease are included in the table above under the caption \"Finance and operating lease obligations.\" For more detailed information, please refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements- 15. Leases and Aircraft Maintenance Deposits.\"\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a line of credit for $3.1 million and $33.6 million related to corporate credit cards. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had drawn $0.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively, which is included within accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had lines of credit with counterparties for both physical fuel delivery and derivatives in the amount of $41.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had drawn $3.7 million on these lines of credit for physical fuel delivery. We are required to post collateral for any excess above the lines of credit if the derivatives, if any, are in a net liability position and make periodic payments in order to maintain an adequate undrawn portion for physical fuel delivery. As of December 31, 2020, we did not hold any derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $11.5 million in uncollateralized surety bonds and a $30.0 million cash collateralized standby letter of credit facility, representing an off balance-sheet commitment, of which $23.6 million had been drawn upon for issued letters of credit.\nGLOSSARY OF AIRLINE TERMS\nSet forth below is a glossary of industry terms:\nAdjusted CASM\u201d means operating expenses, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to fuel derivative contracts, out of period fuel federal excise tax, loss on disposal of assets, special charges (credits), supplemental rent adjustments and federal excise tax recovery adjustments, divided by ASMs.\nAdjusted CASM ex fuel\u201d means operating expenses excluding aircraft fuel expense, loss on disposal of assets, special charges (credits), supplemental rent adjustments and federal excise tax recovery adjustments, divided by ASMs.\nAFA-CWA\u201d means the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.\nAir traffic liability\u201d or ATL\u201d means the value of tickets sold in advance of travel.\nALPA\u201d means the Air Line Pilots Association, International.\nASIF\u201d means an Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee assessed by the TSA on each airline.\nAvailable seat miles\u201d or ASMs\u201d means the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown, also referred to as \"capacity.\"\nAverage aircraft\u201d means the average number of aircraft in our fleet as calculated on a daily basis.\nAverage daily aircraft utilization\u201d means block hours divided by number of days in the period divided by average aircraft.\nAverage fuel cost per gallon\u201d means total aircraft fuel expense divided by the total number of fuel gallons consumed.\nAverage stage length\u201d represents the average number of miles flown per flight.\nAverage yield\u201d means average operating revenue earned per RPM, calculated as total revenue divided by RPMs, also referred to as \"passenger yield.\"\nBlock hours\u201d means the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination.\nCASM\u201d or unit costs\u201d means operating expenses divided by ASMs.\nCBA\u201d means a collective bargaining agreement.\nCBP\u201d means United States Customs and Border Protection.\nDOT\u201d means the United States Department of Transportation.\nEPA\u201d means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"EETC\" means enhanced equipment trust certificate.\nFAA\u201d means the United States Federal Aviation Administration.\nFare revenue per passenger flight segment\u201d means total fare passenger revenue divided by passenger flight segments.\nFCC\u201d means the United States Federal Communications Commission.\n\"FLL Airport\" means the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.\nGDS\u201d means Global Distribution System (e.g., Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan).\n\"IAMAW\" means the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\nInto-plane fuel cost per gallon\u201d means into-plane fuel expense divided by number of fuel gallons consumed.\nInto-plane fuel expense\u201d represents the cost of jet fuel and certain other charges such as fuel taxes and oil.\nLoad factor\u201d means the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight (RPMs divided by ASMs).\nNMB\u201d means the National Mediation Board.\n\"Non-ticket revenue\" means total non-fare passenger revenue and other revenue.\nNon-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment\u201d means total non-fare passenger revenue and other revenue divided by passenger flight segments.\nOTA\u201d means Online Travel Agent (e.g., Orbitz and Travelocity).\n\"PAFCA\" means the Professional Airline Flight Control Association.\nPassenger flight segments\u201d means the total number of passengers flown on all flight segments.\nPDP\u201d means pre-delivery deposit payment.\nRevenue passenger mile\u201d or RPM\u201d means one revenue passenger transported one mile.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is included herein. Unless expressly stated otherwise, for discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2018 items and fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n2020 Year in Review\nWe experienced healthy passenger booking and revenue trends for the first two months of 2020 and year-over-year increases that were in line with our expectations. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year, and we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and capacity reductions. As a result, our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by this reduction in air travel demand.\nWith the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. Load factor for 2020 was 69.7% as compared to 84.4% for the prior year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a decrease in operating revenues of 52.7%, year over year, and a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability.\nWe have implemented measures for the safety of our Guests and Team Members as well as to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our financial position and operations.\nCaring for Guests and Team Members\nOur Operations and Task Force teams remain in constant contact with authorities, continuing to evolve its response to ensure the safety of Guests and Team Members. In addition to previously existing procedures including utilization of hospital-grade disinfectants and state-of-the-art HEPA filters that capture 99.97% of airborne particles on board the aircraft, we have implemented and continued the following steps to protect our Guests and Team Members:\n\u2022Secured and distributed additional supplies of gloves and sanitizer across our network and augmented the contents of onboard supply kits to contain additional cleaning and sanitizing materials;\n\u2022Secured and provided face coverings for all crew and Guest facing team members;\n\u2022Required all Guests to complete a Health Acknowledgement at check-in;\n\u2022Expanded cleaning protocols at airports and other facilities, including the use of EPA-registered disinfectants in all check-in and gate areas and the use of electrostatic sprayers at high-traffic airports;\n\u2022Expanded aircraft turn and overnight cleaning protocols focusing on high frequency touch points as well as enhanced cockpit cleaning and the use of ultra-low volume (\"ULV\") fogging process to apply a safe, high-grade EPA-registered airborne disinfectant that is effective against coronaviruses;\n\u2022Launched a new antimicrobial fogging tool in our facilities and aircraft that uses a product that forms an invisible barrier on all surfaces killing bacteria and viruses on contact for 30 days;\n\u2022Split the Company's Operational Control Center (\"OCC\") into multiple units to enable social distancing and prepared the OCC to work remotely to minimize potential operational disruption;\n\u2022Implemented a remote work policy for the Support Center teams to maintain support of our operations;\n\u2022Automated the Team Member screening process upon entry to all Company-operated facilities by installing an automatic temperature scanner which is activated and monitored 24 hours a day;\n\u2022Required all Guests and Guest-facing Team Members to wear an appropriate face covering when traveling through the airport or onboard aircraft;\n\u2022Limited face to face interaction through automated baggage systems and biometric photo-matching check in;\n\u2022Offered future flight credits with extended expiration dates to Guests with impacted travel plans and waived change and cancellation fees for Guests who booked travel to occur by February 28, 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we will evaluate any continued impact to travel plans and may decide to further extend credit shell expiration dates and/or waive change and cancellation fees in the future.\nSupporting Communities\nDuring this unprecedented time, many travelers have been stranded abroad with bans and other restrictions on travel implemented globally and domestically. We worked with embassies and local governments in Aruba, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, St. Martin and the U.S. to operate special flights for stranded travelers in such countries. During 2020, we provided over 260 flights to more than 30,000 stranded travelers. In addition, during 2020, we pledged $250,000 in vouchers for flights to U.S. organizations advocating for social justice and civil rights.\nWe have also made efforts to address the growing needs of its communities through The Spirit Airlines Charitable Foundation (the Foundation\u201d). As part of the its focus on supporting families, the Foundation partnered with other non-profit organizations including the YMCA and Jack and Jill Children's Center to provide food to seniors and families struggling during this time and supported organizations creating face coverings for healthcare workers. In addition, we have partnered to offer Guests face coverings for a small contribution to the Red Cross.\nCapacity Reductions\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, in response to government restrictions on travel and drastically reduced consumer demand, we began to significantly reduce capacity each month with the largest capacity reduction in May 2020 at approximately 94%, year over year. In response to modest demand recovery, we strategically added back capacity during certain peak travel periods. During the holiday months of November and December, capacity was reduced to a lesser extent with reductions of 20.8% and 20.1%, year over year. We continue to closely monitor demand and will make adjustments to the flight schedule as appropriate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to evolve with recent developments including the uptick in the rate of infections following the 2020 holiday season, the emergency use authorization issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certain COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, and the requirement, effective January 26, 2021, that all U.S. inbound international travelers provide a negative COVID-19 test prior to flying. We currently estimate that air travel demand will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months as the lingering effects of COVID-19 continue to develop. We expect that air travel demand will continue to gradually recover in 2021. However, the situation continues to be fluid and actual capacity adjustments may be different than what we currently expect. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation\" for discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our air traffic liability, credit shells and refunds.\nCOVID-19 Legislation\nOn March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") into law. The CARES Act was a relief package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants to be used for employee salaries, wages and benefits and up to $25 billion in secured loans.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") Agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury (\"Treasury\"), pursuant to which we received a total of $344.4 million, used exclusively to pay for salaries, wages and benefits for our Team Members through September 30, 2020. Of that amount, $73.3 million is in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with its participation in the PSP, we issued to Treasury warrants pursuant to a warrant agreement to purchase up to 520,797 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $14.08 per share (the closing price for the shares of our common stock on April 9, 2020) with a fair value of $3.9 million. The remaining amount of $267.2 million is in the form of a grant and was recognized in special charges and credits, net of related costs, in our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nPursuant to the warrant agreement with the Treasury, we registered the resale of the warrants and the 520,797 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants in September and October 2020. Total warrants issued represent less\nthan 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on the notes issued and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for additional information on the warrants.\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP, we were, and continue to be, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through September 30, 2021;\n\u2022Limits on certain executive compensation including limiting pay increases and severance pay or other benefits upon terminations, through March 24, 2022;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services (including to destinations where there may currently be significantly reduced or no demand) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on involuntary terminations or furloughs of our employees (except for health, disability, cause, or certain disciplinary reasons) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on reducing the salaries, wages, or benefits of our employees (other than our executive officers or independent contractors, or as otherwise permitted under the terms of the PSP) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Limitations on the use of the grant funds exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; and\n\u2022Additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements relating to the CARES Act funds.\nOn April 29, 2020, we applied for additional funds under the Treasury's loan program under the CARES Act ( Loan Program\u201d). On July 1, 2020, we executed a non-binding letter of intent with the Treasury which summarized the principal terms of the financing request submitted by us to the Treasury. In September 2020, we decided that we would not participate in the Treasury's loan program as we were able to secure other forms of financing described below.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. This new legislation provides an extension or additional benefits designed to address the continuing economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill extends the PSP program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021 (\"PSP2\") and provides an additional $15 billion to fund the PSP2 program for employees of passenger air carriers. In late December, we notified the Treasury of our intent to participate in the PSP2 agreement. We entered into a new payroll support program agreement with Treasury on January 15, 2021. We expect to receive approximately $184.5 million pursuant to our participation in the PSP2 program. In January 2021, we received the first installment of $92.2 million in the form of a grant. Of the remaining amount, we expect that approximately $25 million will be in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with our participation in the PSP2, we expect to issue to Treasury warrants to purchase up to 103,761 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $24.42 (the closing price of the shares of our common stock on December 24, 2020).\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP2, we are subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through March 31, 2022;\n\u2022Limits on executive compensation through October 1, 2022;\n\u2022Restrictions from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until March 31, 2021;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services through March 1, 2022;\n\u2022Reporting requirements; and\n\u2022A recall of all employees that were involuntarily furloughed or terminated between October 1, 2020 and the date the carrier enters into the new payroll support agreement with the Treasury. Such employees, if returning to work, must be compensated for lost pay and benefits between December 1, 2020 and the date of such new payroll support agreement.\nThe CARES Act also provided an employee retention credit ( CARES Employee Retention credit\u201d) which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to $5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The credit is equal to 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, capped at $10,000 of qualified wages through year end. We qualified for the credit beginning on April 1, 2020 and received additional credits for qualified wages through December 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $38.5 million related to the CARES Employee Retention credit within special charges (credits) on our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 also extends and expands the availability of the CARES Employee Retention credit through June 30, 2021, however, certain provisions apply only after December 31, 2020. This new legislation amends the employee retention credit to be equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees after December 31, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. During the first two quarters of 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee per calendar quarter may be counted in determining the 70% credit. Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer in 2021 is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter for the first and second quarters of 2021.\nThe CARES Act also provides for certain tax loss carrybacks and a waiver on federal fuel taxes through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had recognized $142.0 million in federal related tax loss carrybacks and $6.5 million in federal fuel tax savings reflected within aircraft fuel in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFinally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred $23.2 million in social security tax payments. The deferred amounts are recorded within other current liabilities and within deferred gains and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 30.9% compared to 23.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax rate, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to a $56.1 million discrete federal tax benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to the passage of the CARES Act. The CARES Act allows for carryback of net operating losses generated at a 21% tax rate to recover taxes paid at a 35% tax rate. Excluding this discrete tax benefit, our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 would have been 21.8%. While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-17, Income Taxes\" for additional information.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity\nSince the onset of the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2020, we have taken several actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. As a result of these actions, as of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities of $1,896.1 million.\nIn March 2020, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"2022 revolving credit facility\") for an initial commitment amount of $110.0 million, and subsequently, in the second quarter of 2020, increased its commitment amount to $180.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had fully drawn the available amount of $180.0 million under the 2022 revolving credit facility. The 2022 revolving credit facility matures on March 30, 2022. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our 2022 revolving credit facility.\nOn May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the convertible notes\u201d). The convertible notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per year and will mature on May 15, 2025. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020. We received proceeds of $168.3 million, net of total issuance costs of $6.7 million, and recorded $95.6 million in long-term debt and finance leases, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million, on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the debt component of our convertible notes, and $72.7 million in additional paid-in-capital (\"APIC\"), net of issuance costs of $2.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the equity component of the convertible notes. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our convertible debt.\nAlso on May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of 20,125,000 shares of our voting common stock, which includes full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,625,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $10.00 per share (the common stock offering\u201d). We received proceeds of $192.4 million, net of issuance costs of $8.9 million. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information on our common stock offering.\nIn June 2020, we entered into an agreement to amend our revolving credit facility entered into in 2018 to finance aircraft pre-delivery payments. The agreement amends the revolving credit facility to extend the final maturity date from December 30, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Upon execution of the amended agreement, the maximum borrowing capacity decreased from\n$160.0 million to $111.2 million. This facility is secured by the collateral assignment of certain of our rights under the purchase agreement with Airbus. As of December 31, 2020, collateralized amounts were related to 11 Airbus A320neo aircraft scheduled to be delivered between June 2021 and April 2022. The maximum borrowing capacity of $95.1 million, as of December 31, 2020, decreased from $111.2 million due to the delivery of aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and will continue to decrease as we take delivery of the related aircraft. The amendment provides approximately $54 million in additional liquidity through March 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nAlso, in June 2020, we entered into an agreement to defer certain aircraft deliveries originally scheduled in 2020 and 2021, as well as the related pre-delivery deposit payments. We may elect to supplement these deliveries by additional acquisitions from the manufacturer or in the open market if demand conditions merit. We also may adjust or defer deliveries, or change models of aircraft in our delivery stream, from time to time, as a means to match our future capacity with anticipated demand and growth trends. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took delivery of 12 aircraft. In addition, the Company has 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-18, Commitments and Contingencies\" for further information on our future aircraft deliveries.\nOn July 22, 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement relating to the issuance and sale from time to time of up to 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). During the third quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of all 9,000,000 shares under our \"at-the-market offering\" program (\"ATM program\") and had received proceeds of $156.7 million, net of $5.0 million in related issuance costs. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information.\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced the completion of the private offering by Spirit IP Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company of an aggregate of $850 million principal amount of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 (the 8.00% senior secured notes\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes are guaranteed by the Company, Spirit Finance Cayman 1 Ltd. ( HoldCo 1\u201d), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Finance Cayman 2 Ltd., a direct subsidiary of HoldCo 1 and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( HoldCo 2\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes will be secured by, among other things, a first priority lien on the core assets of the Company's loyalty programs, comprised of cash proceeds from its Free Spirit co-branded credit card programs, its $9 Fare ClubTM program membership fees, and certain intellectual property required or necessary to operate the loyalty programs, as well as the Company's brand intellectual property. Refer to Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation, for further information on the Company's loyalty programs. The 8.00% senior secured notes will mature on September 20, 2025. The 8.00% senior secured notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum, payable in quarterly installments on January 20, April 20, July 20 and October 20 of each year, beginning January 20, 2021. We received proceeds of $823.9 million, net of issuance costs of $17.4 million and original issue discount of $8.7 million, related to this private offering. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nIn addition, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional action, including:\n\u2022Reduced planned discretionary non-aircraft capital spend in 2020 by approximately $70 million;\n\u2022Deferred approximately $25 million in heavy maintenance events from 2020 to 2021;\n\u2022Reduced planned non-fuel operating costs for 2020 by approximately $30 million, excluding savings related to reduced capacity;\n\u2022Suspended hiring across the Company except to fill essential roles;\n\u2022Entered into agreements to defer payments in 2020 related to facility rents and other airport services contracts at certain locations;\n\u2022Entered into agreements with lessors to temporarily defer aircraft rent payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with service providers to temporarily defer maintenance and service contract payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with unionized and non-unionized employees to create voluntary leave programs;\n\u2022Continued to pursue additional financing secured by its unencumbered assets.\nWe continue to engage in discussions with our significant stakeholders and vendors regarding financial support or contract adjustments, including extensions of payment terms, during this transition period.\nFor purposes of assessing our liquidity needs, we estimate that demand will continue to be volatile as we recover through 2021, but remain well below 2019 levels. We believe the actions described above, along with the expected funds of the PSP2 program, sufficiently address our future liquidity needs. However, we anticipate we may implement further discretionary changes, cost reduction and liquidity preservation and/or enhancement measures, as needed, to address the volatility and\nchanging dynamics of passenger demand and the impact of revenue changes, regulatory and public health directives and prevailing government policy and financial market conditions.\nWorkforce Actions\nIn July 2020, we distributed a letter to employees, including approximately 2,500 U.S.-based union represented employees, regarding the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, we worked with unionized employees and the related unions to create voluntary leave programs for pilots, flight attendants and other unionized employee groups. We also created voluntary leave programs for certain non-unionized employee groups. In August 2020, we announced a voluntary separation program for non-unionized employees. Due to the high level of support and acceptance of the voluntary programs offered, no unionized employees were involuntarily furloughed and the total number of non-unionized employees involuntarily separated as of October 1, 2020 was reduced by more than 95%. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $2.5 million in expenses related to the voluntary and involuntary employee separations. These expenses were recorded within special credits (charges) on our consolidated statement of operations. Expenses related to voluntary leave programs were recorded within salaries, wages and benefits on our consolidated statement of operations. With our expected participation in the PSP2 program, we will comply with any related restrictions and limitations on any workforce actions.\nSummary of Results\nDuring 2020, we had a net loss of $428.7 million ($5.06 per share, diluted), compared to a net income of $335.3 million ($4.89 per share, diluted) in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by a 45.2% decrease in our traffic and a 13.8% decrease in average yield, year over year. Due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we decreased our capacity by 33.7%, as compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the net loss incurred in the period was a $302.8 million special credit recorded within special charges (credits), operating. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a negative operating margin of 28.1% on $1,810.0 million in operating revenues. TRASM in 2020 was 6.53 cents, a decrease of 28.8% compared to the prior year. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.5%, year over year, from $110.91 to $98.14. Fare revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 24.9% partially offset by a 1.5% increase in non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in total fare revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily due to a decrease of 13.8% in average yield, year over year.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2020, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel increased by 42.2% to 7.89 cents. The increase on a per-ASM basis was primarily due to increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, landing fees and other rents expense and aircraft rent expense on a per-ASM basis. These increases on a per-ASM basis were mostly driven by the semi-fixed nature of many of these costs combined with a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we added 4 new destinations: Barranquilla, Colombia; Bucaramanga, Colombia; Cap-Haitien, Haiti; Orange County, California. During 2020, we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 145 to 157 aircraft as we took delivery of 8 new aircraft financed under secured debt arrangements, 1 aircraft under a sale-leaseback transaction and 3 aircraft under direct operating leases. In addition, we purchased 2 previously leased aircraft. We also took delivery of 2 new engines through cash purchases. As of December 31, 2020, our 157 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 31 A319ceos, 64 A320ceos, 32 A320neos and 30 A321ceos of which 72 aircraft are financed through secured debt, 56 are financed under operating leases, and 29 are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our aircraft orders consisted of 136 A320 family aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2027.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and other revenues.\nPassenger revenues\nFare revenues. Tickets sold are initially deferred within air traffic liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Passenger fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided. Generally, all tickets sold by the Company are nonrefundable. An unused ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue at the date of\nscheduled travel. Fare revenues are recorded within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\"\nNon-fare revenues. Our most significant non-fare revenues generally include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. These ancillary items are deemed part of the single performance obligation of providing passenger transportation and as such, are recognized in non-fare revenues within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\" The majority of our passenger non-fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided.\nPassenger revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and non-fare revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided.\nRevenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program and other loyalty programs are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09. Guests may earn mileage credits based on their spending with the co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations, as discussed below.\nOur co-branded credit card agreement provides for joint marketing where cardholders earn mileage credits for making purchases using co-branded cards. During 2020, we extended our agreement with the administrator of the FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program to extend through March 31, 2024. In connection with the extension of the agreement, in January 2021, we launched a new loyalty program with extended mileage expiration, additional benefits based on status tiers, and other changes. We account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts. The new program terms will require updated estimates of the allocation of future revenues to the performance obligations described above.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of the marketing component of the sale of frequent flyer miles to our credit card partner and commissions revenue from the sale of various items such as hotels and rental cars.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. We recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. Upon collection from the customer, we record a liability within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from activity on our fuel derivatives, if any.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and heavy maintenance. Under the deferral method, the cost of our heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of all minimum lease payments under the terms of our aircraft and spare engine lease agreements recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, aircraft rent expense was net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-15. Leases and Prepaid Maintenance Deposits\u201d for information regarding the Company's accounting policy on sale-leaseback transactions after the adoption of Topic 842. As of December 31, 2020, 56 of our 157 aircraft and 8 of our 24 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors and in-house mechanics required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs, including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets. In addition, subsequent to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, it includes net losses or gains resulting from our aircraft and engine sale-leaseback transactions.\nSpecial Charges (Credits). Special charges and credits include recognition of the grant component of the Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") with the Treasury, the CARES Act Employee Retention credit, amounts paid in connection with our voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs, ratification incentive payouts related to the collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and dispatchers and the write-off of aircraft related credits.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nOther (Income) Expense\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2020 primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft as well as the interest and accretion related to our convertible notes and 8.00% senior secured notes. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft.\nCapitalized Interest. The Company capitalizes the interest that is primarily attributable to the outstanding PDP balances as a percentage of the related debt on which interest is incurred. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of a long-term asset and is the amount which theoretically could have been avoided had we not paid PDPs for the related aircraft or engines. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily relates to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\nInterest Income. For 2020, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as interest earned on income tax refunds. For 2019, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For 2018, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash\nequivalents, short-term investments and on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our Series 2017-1 EETC.\nOther Expense. Other expense primarily includes realized gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Non-operating. We had no special charges, non-operating in 2020 and 2019. For 2018, special charges, non-operating represents interest related to an aircraft purchase agreement for the acquisition of 14 A319 aircraft previously operated under operating leases. The contract was deemed a lease modification which resulted in a change of classification from operating leases to finance leases, until the purchase date of the aircraft. Please see \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nAbility to Execute our Growth Strategy. Over recent years, we have pursued a high-growth strategy, which we expect to continue. Execution of such a strategy requires us to effectively deploy new flying into our network, as new routes or increased frequency of existing routes develop. New flying may not perform as well as expected or may result in a competitive reaction. Moreover, our growth strategy depends on the timely delivery of aircraft and engines in accordance with the intended delivery schedule in accordance with the applicable agreement. Delivery delays, as we have experienced from time to time in recent years, may cause us to scale back our growth, unless we are able to replace delayed aircraft in the secondary market or otherwise. Finally, our growth strategy relies in part on our ability to obtain additional facilities in airports, some of which are constrained, as well as additional flight crew, maintenance, and other personnel. We expect to experience an increase in our compensation expense to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nAbility to Maintain or Grow Capacity. We pursue a high-growth strategy that expands revenue and maintains lower cost due to economies of scale and lower initial expense for aircraft and labor. Execution of such a strategy depends on the ability to maintain efficient utilization of existing capacity and the timely delivery of new aircraft and engines. In recent years, we have experienced aircraft operational reliability and delivery delays particularly regarding our A320neo aircraft. The new generation aircraft provide fuel burn and other efficiencies, as compared to the older A320ceo aircraft, and the ability to serve additional markets with greater operating range. However, ongoing or expanded reliability and delivery issues could materially impact our operations, costs and net results.\nImpact of COVID-19. During 2020, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and refunds. Our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by the reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a significant decrease in capacity and operating revenues, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability. For more detailed information on the impact of COVID-19, please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. Impact of COVID-19.\"\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target\npromotions and frequent flyer initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods in efforts to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nMoreover, the network carriers have developed a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting may have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of high-cost carriers but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of corporate and less price-sensitive travelers. Refer to Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Industry-We operate in an extremely competitive industry.\"\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represents one of our largest operating expenses, as it does for most airlines. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives and we have not engaged in fuel derivative activity since 2015. As of December 31, 2020, we purchased a majority of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have five union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 82% of our employees at December 31, 2020. Our pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association, or PAFCA, our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW, and our passenger service agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union, or TWU. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages.\nDuring 2017, we experienced operational disruption from pilot-related work action which adversely impacted our results. We obtained a temporary restraining order to enjoin further illegal labor action. In January 2018, under the guidance of the NMB assigned mediators, the parties reached a tentative agreement. In February 2018, the pilot group voted to approve the current five-year agreement with us. In connection with the current agreement, we incurred a one-time ratification incentive of $80.2 million, including payroll taxes, and an $8.5 million adjustment related to other contractual provisions. These amounts were recorded in special charges (credits) within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, under the supervision of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight attendants, which becomes amendable May 2021.\nOur dispatchers are represented by the PAFCA. In June 2018, we commenced negotiations with PAFCA for an amended agreement with our dispatchers. In October 2018, PAFCA and the Company reached a tentative agreement for a new five-year agreement, which was ratified by the PAFCA members in October 2018.\nIn July 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms. In June 2016, we reached an agreement on the remaining terms of the collective bargaining agreement. In February 2020, the IAMAW notified us, as required by the Railway Labor Act, that it intends to submit proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement covering our ramp service agents, which became amendable in June 2020. The parties expect to schedule meeting dates for negotiations soon.\nIn June 2018, our passenger service agents voted to be represented by the TWU, but the representation only applies to our Fort Lauderdale station where we have direct employees in the passenger service classification. We began meeting with the TWU in late October 2018 to negotiate an initial collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we continued to negotiate with the TWU.\nWe believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. This law may be repealed in its entirety or certain aspects may be changed or replaced. If the law is repealed or modified or if new legislation is passed, such action could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense generally increases each year mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. However, in 2020, maintenance expense decreased year over year mainly as a result of decreased aircraft utilization due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As our fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time particularly in the current period given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our airline.\nAs a result of a majority of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on certain aircraft will overlap, meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations on certain aircraft at roughly the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods.\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nLoyalty Mileage Credits earned with Co-branded credit card. Customers may earn mileage credits based on their spending with our co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations. The agreement provides for joint marketing and we account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\") for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts.\nWe defer the amount for award travel obligation as part of loyalty deferred revenue within air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily marketing components, is recorded in other revenue as miles are delivered. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash sales from this agreement were $33.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations.\nAircraft Maintenance Deposits. Some of our aircraft and engine master lease agreements provide that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities. These lease agreements generally provide that maintenance reserves are reimbursable to us upon completion of the maintenance event. A majority of these maintenance reserve payments are calculated based on a utilization measure, such as flight hours or cycles, and are used solely to collateralize the lessor for maintenance time run off the aircraft until the completion of the maintenance of the aircraft.\nMaintenance reserve payments are reflected as aircraft maintenance deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We make certain assumptions to determine the recoverability of maintenance deposits. These assumptions are based on various factors such as the estimated time between the maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft is estimated before it is returned to the lessor. When it is not probable we will recover amounts currently on deposit with a lessor, such amounts are expensed as supplemental rent.\nSupplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. We expensed $3.3 million and $4.8 million of supplemental rent recorded within aircraft rent during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We did not expense any paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent in 2020. During 2019, we expensed $0.5 million of paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had aircraft maintenance deposits of $126.3 million and $170.6 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\nLeased Aircraft Return Costs. Our aircraft lease agreements often contain provisions that require us to return aircraft airframes and engines to the lessor in a certain condition or pay an amount to the lessor based on the airframe and engine's actual return condition. Lease return costs include all costs that would be incurred at the return of the aircraft, including costs incurred to repair the airframe and engines to the required condition as stipulated by the lease. Lease return costs are recognized beginning when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated. When costs become both probable and estimable, they are accrued as a component of supplemental rent, through the remaining lease term.\nWhen determining the need to accrue lease return costs, there are various factors which need to be considered such as the contractual terms of the lease agreement, current condition of the aircraft, the age of the aircraft at lease expiration, and projected number of hours run on the engine at the time of return, among others. In addition, typically near the lease return date, the lessors may allow reserves to be applied as return condition consideration or pass on certain return provisions if they do not align with their current plans to remarket the aircraft. As a result of the different factors listed above, management assesses the need to accrue lease return costs periodically throughout the year or whenever facts and circumstances warrant an assessment.\nLease return costs will generally be estimable closer to the end of the lease term but may be estimable earlier in the lease term depending on the contractual terms of the lease agreement and the timing of maintenance events for a particular aircraft. As a result of COVID-19, we are currently operating our aircraft at lower utilization levels. If we continue flying our aircraft at lower utilization levels beyond our current projections, the timing of future maintenance events may change such that we will be required to accrue lease return costs and/or record reserves against our maintenance deposits earlier than we would have expected and such amounts could be significant. We expect lease return costs and unrecoverable maintenance deposits will increase as individual aircraft lease agreements approach their respective termination dates and we begin to accrue the estimated cost of return conditions for the corresponding aircraft. Upon a termination of the lease due to a breach by us, we would be liable for standard contractual damages, possibly including damages suffered by the lessor in connection with remarketing the aircraft or while the aircraft is not leased to another party.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2020, we generated operating revenues of $1,810.0 million and had an operating loss of $507.8 million resulting in a negative operating margin of 28.1% and a net loss of $428.7 million. In 2019, we generated operating revenues of $3,830.5 million and operating income of $501.0 million resulting in a 13.1% operating margin and net income of $335.3 million. The decrease in operating revenues, year over year, is primarily due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March and continuing through the remainder of the year. The length and severity of the reduction in air travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain. We expect air travel demand recovery will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months until the global pandemic has moderated and demand for air travel returns.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents was $1,789.7 million, an increase of $810.8 million compared to the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents is generally driven by cash from our operating activities offset by cash used to fund PDPs and capital expenditures. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mostly driven by cash provided from financing activities primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and warrants as well as funds received in connection with the PSP. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, as", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is included herein. Unless expressly stated otherwise, for discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2018 items and fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n2020 Year in Review\nWe experienced healthy passenger booking and revenue trends for the first two months of 2020 and year-over-year increases that were in line with our expectations. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020, which continued through the remainder of the year, and we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and capacity reductions. As a result, our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by this reduction in air travel demand.\nWith the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. Load factor for 2020 was 69.7% as compared to 84.4% for the prior year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a decrease in operating revenues of 52.7%, year over year, and a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability.\nWe have implemented measures for the safety of our Guests and Team Members as well as to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our financial position and operations.\nCaring for Guests and Team Members\nOur Operations and Task Force teams remain in constant contact with authorities, continuing to evolve its response to ensure the safety of Guests and Team Members. In addition to previously existing procedures including utilization of hospital-grade disinfectants and state-of-the-art HEPA filters that capture 99.97% of airborne particles on board the aircraft, we have implemented and continued the following steps to protect our Guests and Team Members:\n\u2022Secured and distributed additional supplies of gloves and sanitizer across our network and augmented the contents of onboard supply kits to contain additional cleaning and sanitizing materials;\n\u2022Secured and provided face coverings for all crew and Guest facing team members;\n\u2022Required all Guests to complete a Health Acknowledgement at check-in;\n\u2022Expanded cleaning protocols at airports and other facilities, including the use of EPA-registered disinfectants in all check-in and gate areas and the use of electrostatic sprayers at high-traffic airports;\n\u2022Expanded aircraft turn and overnight cleaning protocols focusing on high frequency touch points as well as enhanced cockpit cleaning and the use of ultra-low volume (\"ULV\") fogging process to apply a safe, high-grade EPA-registered airborne disinfectant that is effective against coronaviruses;\n\u2022Launched a new antimicrobial fogging tool in our facilities and aircraft that uses a product that forms an invisible barrier on all surfaces killing bacteria and viruses on contact for 30 days;\n\u2022Split the Company's Operational Control Center (\"OCC\") into multiple units to enable social distancing and prepared the OCC to work remotely to minimize potential operational disruption;\n\u2022Implemented a remote work policy for the Support Center teams to maintain support of our operations;\n\u2022Automated the Team Member screening process upon entry to all Company-operated facilities by installing an automatic temperature scanner which is activated and monitored 24 hours a day;\n\u2022Required all Guests and Guest-facing Team Members to wear an appropriate face covering when traveling through the airport or onboard aircraft;\n\u2022Limited face to face interaction through automated baggage systems and biometric photo-matching check in;\n\u2022Offered future flight credits with extended expiration dates to Guests with impacted travel plans and waived change and cancellation fees for Guests who booked travel to occur by February 28, 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we will evaluate any continued impact to travel plans and may decide to further extend credit shell expiration dates and/or waive change and cancellation fees in the future.\nSupporting Communities\nDuring this unprecedented time, many travelers have been stranded abroad with bans and other restrictions on travel implemented globally and domestically. We worked with embassies and local governments in Aruba, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, St. Martin and the U.S. to operate special flights for stranded travelers in such countries. During 2020, we provided over 260 flights to more than 30,000 stranded travelers. In addition, during 2020, we pledged $250,000 in vouchers for flights to U.S. organizations advocating for social justice and civil rights.\nWe have also made efforts to address the growing needs of its communities through The Spirit Airlines Charitable Foundation (the Foundation\u201d). As part of the its focus on supporting families, the Foundation partnered with other non-profit organizations including the YMCA and Jack and Jill Children's Center to provide food to seniors and families struggling during this time and supported organizations creating face coverings for healthcare workers. In addition, we have partnered to offer Guests face coverings for a small contribution to the Red Cross.\nCapacity Reductions\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, in response to government restrictions on travel and drastically reduced consumer demand, we began to significantly reduce capacity each month with the largest capacity reduction in May 2020 at approximately 94%, year over year. In response to modest demand recovery, we strategically added back capacity during certain peak travel periods. During the holiday months of November and December, capacity was reduced to a lesser extent with reductions of 20.8% and 20.1%, year over year. We continue to closely monitor demand and will make adjustments to the flight schedule as appropriate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to evolve with recent developments including the uptick in the rate of infections following the 2020 holiday season, the emergency use authorization issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certain COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, and the requirement, effective January 26, 2021, that all U.S. inbound international travelers provide a negative COVID-19 test prior to flying. We currently estimate that air travel demand will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months as the lingering effects of COVID-19 continue to develop. We expect that air travel demand will continue to gradually recover in 2021. However, the situation continues to be fluid and actual capacity adjustments may be different than what we currently expect. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation\" for discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our air traffic liability, credit shells and refunds.\nCOVID-19 Legislation\nOn March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") into law. The CARES Act was a relief package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants to be used for employee salaries, wages and benefits and up to $25 billion in secured loans.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") Agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury (\"Treasury\"), pursuant to which we received a total of $344.4 million, used exclusively to pay for salaries, wages and benefits for our Team Members through September 30, 2020. Of that amount, $73.3 million is in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with its participation in the PSP, we issued to Treasury warrants pursuant to a warrant agreement to purchase up to 520,797 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $14.08 per share (the closing price for the shares of our common stock on April 9, 2020) with a fair value of $3.9 million. The remaining amount of $267.2 million is in the form of a grant and was recognized in special charges and credits, net of related costs, in our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nPursuant to the warrant agreement with the Treasury, we registered the resale of the warrants and the 520,797 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants in September and October 2020. Total warrants issued represent less\nthan 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on the notes issued and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for additional information on the warrants.\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP, we were, and continue to be, subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through September 30, 2021;\n\u2022Limits on certain executive compensation including limiting pay increases and severance pay or other benefits upon terminations, through March 24, 2022;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services (including to destinations where there may currently be significantly reduced or no demand) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on involuntary terminations or furloughs of our employees (except for health, disability, cause, or certain disciplinary reasons) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022A prohibition on reducing the salaries, wages, or benefits of our employees (other than our executive officers or independent contractors, or as otherwise permitted under the terms of the PSP) through September 30, 2020;\n\u2022Limitations on the use of the grant funds exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; and\n\u2022Additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements relating to the CARES Act funds.\nOn April 29, 2020, we applied for additional funds under the Treasury's loan program under the CARES Act ( Loan Program\u201d). On July 1, 2020, we executed a non-binding letter of intent with the Treasury which summarized the principal terms of the financing request submitted by us to the Treasury. In September 2020, we decided that we would not participate in the Treasury's loan program as we were able to secure other forms of financing described below.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. This new legislation provides an extension or additional benefits designed to address the continuing economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill extends the PSP program of the CARES Act through March 31, 2021 (\"PSP2\") and provides an additional $15 billion to fund the PSP2 program for employees of passenger air carriers. In late December, we notified the Treasury of our intent to participate in the PSP2 agreement. We entered into a new payroll support program agreement with Treasury on January 15, 2021. We expect to receive approximately $184.5 million pursuant to our participation in the PSP2 program. In January 2021, we received the first installment of $92.2 million in the form of a grant. Of the remaining amount, we expect that approximately $25 million will be in the form of a low-interest 10-year loan. In addition, in connection with our participation in the PSP2, we expect to issue to Treasury warrants to purchase up to 103,761 shares of our common stock at a strike price of $24.42 (the closing price of the shares of our common stock on December 24, 2020).\nIn connection with our participation in the PSP2, we are subject to certain restrictions and limitations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Restrictions on payment of dividends and stock buybacks through March 31, 2022;\n\u2022Limits on executive compensation through October 1, 2022;\n\u2022Restrictions from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until March 31, 2021;\n\u2022Requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled services through March 1, 2022;\n\u2022Reporting requirements; and\n\u2022A recall of all employees that were involuntarily furloughed or terminated between October 1, 2020 and the date the carrier enters into the new payroll support agreement with the Treasury. Such employees, if returning to work, must be compensated for lost pay and benefits between December 1, 2020 and the date of such new payroll support agreement.\nThe CARES Act also provided an employee retention credit ( CARES Employee Retention credit\u201d) which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to $5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The credit is equal to 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, capped at $10,000 of qualified wages through year end. We qualified for the credit beginning on April 1, 2020 and received additional credits for qualified wages through December 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $38.5 million related to the CARES Employee Retention credit within special charges (credits) on our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5, Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 also extends and expands the availability of the CARES Employee Retention credit through June 30, 2021, however, certain provisions apply only after December 31, 2020. This new legislation amends the employee retention credit to be equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees after December 31, 2020, and before July 1, 2021. During the first two quarters of 2021, a maximum of $10,000 in qualified wages for each employee per calendar quarter may be counted in determining the 70% credit. Therefore, the maximum tax credit that can be claimed by an eligible employer in 2021 is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter for the first and second quarters of 2021.\nThe CARES Act also provides for certain tax loss carrybacks and a waiver on federal fuel taxes through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had recognized $142.0 million in federal related tax loss carrybacks and $6.5 million in federal fuel tax savings reflected within aircraft fuel in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFinally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred $23.2 million in social security tax payments. The deferred amounts are recorded within other current liabilities and within deferred gains and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was 30.9% compared to 23.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in tax rate, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to a $56.1 million discrete federal tax benefit recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to the passage of the CARES Act. The CARES Act allows for carryback of net operating losses generated at a 21% tax rate to recover taxes paid at a 35% tax rate. Excluding this discrete tax benefit, our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 would have been 21.8%. While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-17, Income Taxes\" for additional information.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity\nSince the onset of the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2020, we have taken several actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. As a result of these actions, as of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities of $1,896.1 million.\nIn March 2020, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"2022 revolving credit facility\") for an initial commitment amount of $110.0 million, and subsequently, in the second quarter of 2020, increased its commitment amount to $180.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had fully drawn the available amount of $180.0 million under the 2022 revolving credit facility. The 2022 revolving credit facility matures on March 30, 2022. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our 2022 revolving credit facility.\nOn May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the convertible notes\u201d). The convertible notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per year and will mature on May 15, 2025. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020. We received proceeds of $168.3 million, net of total issuance costs of $6.7 million, and recorded $95.6 million in long-term debt and finance leases, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million, on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the debt component of our convertible notes, and $72.7 million in additional paid-in-capital (\"APIC\"), net of issuance costs of $2.9 million on our consolidated balance sheets, related to the equity component of the convertible notes. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for additional information on our convertible debt.\nAlso on May 12, 2020, we completed the public offering of 20,125,000 shares of our voting common stock, which includes full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,625,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $10.00 per share (the common stock offering\u201d). We received proceeds of $192.4 million, net of issuance costs of $8.9 million. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information on our common stock offering.\nIn June 2020, we entered into an agreement to amend our revolving credit facility entered into in 2018 to finance aircraft pre-delivery payments. The agreement amends the revolving credit facility to extend the final maturity date from December 30, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Upon execution of the amended agreement, the maximum borrowing capacity decreased from\n$160.0 million to $111.2 million. This facility is secured by the collateral assignment of certain of our rights under the purchase agreement with Airbus. As of December 31, 2020, collateralized amounts were related to 11 Airbus A320neo aircraft scheduled to be delivered between June 2021 and April 2022. The maximum borrowing capacity of $95.1 million, as of December 31, 2020, decreased from $111.2 million due to the delivery of aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and will continue to decrease as we take delivery of the related aircraft. The amendment provides approximately $54 million in additional liquidity through March 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nAlso, in June 2020, we entered into an agreement to defer certain aircraft deliveries originally scheduled in 2020 and 2021, as well as the related pre-delivery deposit payments. We may elect to supplement these deliveries by additional acquisitions from the manufacturer or in the open market if demand conditions merit. We also may adjust or defer deliveries, or change models of aircraft in our delivery stream, from time to time, as a means to match our future capacity with anticipated demand and growth trends. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took delivery of 12 aircraft. In addition, the Company has 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-18, Commitments and Contingencies\" for further information on our future aircraft deliveries.\nOn July 22, 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement relating to the issuance and sale from time to time of up to 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). During the third quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of all 9,000,000 shares under our \"at-the-market offering\" program (\"ATM program\") and had received proceeds of $156.7 million, net of $5.0 million in related issuance costs. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-11, Common Stock and Preferred Stock\" for further information.\nOn September 17, 2020, we announced the completion of the private offering by Spirit IP Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company of an aggregate of $850 million principal amount of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 (the 8.00% senior secured notes\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes are guaranteed by the Company, Spirit Finance Cayman 1 Ltd. ( HoldCo 1\u201d), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Spirit Finance Cayman 2 Ltd., a direct subsidiary of HoldCo 1 and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( HoldCo 2\u201d). The 8.00% senior secured notes will be secured by, among other things, a first priority lien on the core assets of the Company's loyalty programs, comprised of cash proceeds from its Free Spirit co-branded credit card programs, its $9 Fare ClubTM program membership fees, and certain intellectual property required or necessary to operate the loyalty programs, as well as the Company's brand intellectual property. Refer to Note 4, Revenue Disaggregation, for further information on the Company's loyalty programs. The 8.00% senior secured notes will mature on September 20, 2025. The 8.00% senior secured notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum, payable in quarterly installments on January 20, April 20, July 20 and October 20 of each year, beginning January 20, 2021. We received proceeds of $823.9 million, net of issuance costs of $17.4 million and original issue discount of $8.7 million, related to this private offering. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-14, Debt and Other Obligations\" for further information.\nIn addition, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional action, including:\n\u2022Reduced planned discretionary non-aircraft capital spend in 2020 by approximately $70 million;\n\u2022Deferred approximately $25 million in heavy maintenance events from 2020 to 2021;\n\u2022Reduced planned non-fuel operating costs for 2020 by approximately $30 million, excluding savings related to reduced capacity;\n\u2022Suspended hiring across the Company except to fill essential roles;\n\u2022Entered into agreements to defer payments in 2020 related to facility rents and other airport services contracts at certain locations;\n\u2022Entered into agreements with lessors to temporarily defer aircraft rent payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with service providers to temporarily defer maintenance and service contract payments;\n\u2022Continued to work with unionized and non-unionized employees to create voluntary leave programs;\n\u2022Continued to pursue additional financing secured by its unencumbered assets.\nWe continue to engage in discussions with our significant stakeholders and vendors regarding financial support or contract adjustments, including extensions of payment terms, during this transition period.\nFor purposes of assessing our liquidity needs, we estimate that demand will continue to be volatile as we recover through 2021, but remain well below 2019 levels. We believe the actions described above, along with the expected funds of the PSP2 program, sufficiently address our future liquidity needs. However, we anticipate we may implement further discretionary changes, cost reduction and liquidity preservation and/or enhancement measures, as needed, to address the volatility and\nchanging dynamics of passenger demand and the impact of revenue changes, regulatory and public health directives and prevailing government policy and financial market conditions.\nWorkforce Actions\nIn July 2020, we distributed a letter to employees, including approximately 2,500 U.S.-based union represented employees, regarding the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, we worked with unionized employees and the related unions to create voluntary leave programs for pilots, flight attendants and other unionized employee groups. We also created voluntary leave programs for certain non-unionized employee groups. In August 2020, we announced a voluntary separation program for non-unionized employees. Due to the high level of support and acceptance of the voluntary programs offered, no unionized employees were involuntarily furloughed and the total number of non-unionized employees involuntarily separated as of October 1, 2020 was reduced by more than 95%. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $2.5 million in expenses related to the voluntary and involuntary employee separations. These expenses were recorded within special credits (charges) on our consolidated statement of operations. Expenses related to voluntary leave programs were recorded within salaries, wages and benefits on our consolidated statement of operations. With our expected participation in the PSP2 program, we will comply with any related restrictions and limitations on any workforce actions.\nSummary of Results\nDuring 2020, we had a net loss of $428.7 million ($5.06 per share, diluted), compared to a net income of $335.3 million ($4.89 per share, diluted) in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by a 45.2% decrease in our traffic and a 13.8% decrease in average yield, year over year. Due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we decreased our capacity by 33.7%, as compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the net loss incurred in the period was a $302.8 million special credit recorded within special charges (credits), operating. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for additional information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a negative operating margin of 28.1% on $1,810.0 million in operating revenues. TRASM in 2020 was 6.53 cents, a decrease of 28.8% compared to the prior year. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.5%, year over year, from $110.91 to $98.14. Fare revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 24.9% partially offset by a 1.5% increase in non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in total fare revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily due to a decrease of 13.8% in average yield, year over year.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2020, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel increased by 42.2% to 7.89 cents. The increase on a per-ASM basis was primarily due to increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, landing fees and other rents expense and aircraft rent expense on a per-ASM basis. These increases on a per-ASM basis were mostly driven by the semi-fixed nature of many of these costs combined with a decrease in capacity of 33.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we added 4 new destinations: Barranquilla, Colombia; Bucaramanga, Colombia; Cap-Haitien, Haiti; Orange County, California. During 2020, we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 145 to 157 aircraft as we took delivery of 8 new aircraft financed under secured debt arrangements, 1 aircraft under a sale-leaseback transaction and 3 aircraft under direct operating leases. In addition, we purchased 2 previously leased aircraft. We also took delivery of 2 new engines through cash purchases. As of December 31, 2020, our 157 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 31 A319ceos, 64 A320ceos, 32 A320neos and 30 A321ceos of which 72 aircraft are financed through secured debt, 56 are financed under operating leases, and 29 are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2020, our aircraft orders consisted of 136 A320 family aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2027.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and other revenues.\nPassenger revenues\nFare revenues. Tickets sold are initially deferred within air traffic liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Passenger fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided. Generally, all tickets sold by the Company are nonrefundable. An unused ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue at the date of\nscheduled travel. Fare revenues are recorded within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\"\nNon-fare revenues. Our most significant non-fare revenues generally include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. These ancillary items are deemed part of the single performance obligation of providing passenger transportation and as such, are recognized in non-fare revenues within passenger revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Refer to our disaggregated revenue table within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- 4. Revenue Disaggregation.\" The majority of our passenger non-fare revenues are recognized at time of departure when transportation is provided.\nPassenger revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and non-fare revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided.\nRevenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program and other loyalty programs are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09. Guests may earn mileage credits based on their spending with the co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations, as discussed below.\nOur co-branded credit card agreement provides for joint marketing where cardholders earn mileage credits for making purchases using co-branded cards. During 2020, we extended our agreement with the administrator of the FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program to extend through March 31, 2024. In connection with the extension of the agreement, in January 2021, we launched a new loyalty program with extended mileage expiration, additional benefits based on status tiers, and other changes. We account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts. The new program terms will require updated estimates of the allocation of future revenues to the performance obligations described above.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of the marketing component of the sale of frequent flyer miles to our credit card partner and commissions revenue from the sale of various items such as hotels and rental cars.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. We recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. Upon collection from the customer, we record a liability within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from activity on our fuel derivatives, if any.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and heavy maintenance. Under the deferral method, the cost of our heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of all minimum lease payments under the terms of our aircraft and spare engine lease agreements recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, aircraft rent expense was net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. Refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-15. Leases and Prepaid Maintenance Deposits\u201d for information regarding the Company's accounting policy on sale-leaseback transactions after the adoption of Topic 842. As of December 31, 2020, 56 of our 157 aircraft and 8 of our 24 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors and in-house mechanics required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs, including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets. In addition, subsequent to the adoption of Topic 842 that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, it includes net losses or gains resulting from our aircraft and engine sale-leaseback transactions.\nSpecial Charges (Credits). Special charges and credits include recognition of the grant component of the Payroll Support Program (\"PSP\") with the Treasury, the CARES Act Employee Retention credit, amounts paid in connection with our voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs, ratification incentive payouts related to the collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and dispatchers and the write-off of aircraft related credits.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nOther (Income) Expense\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2020 primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft as well as the interest and accretion related to our convertible notes and 8.00% senior secured notes. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft.\nCapitalized Interest. The Company capitalizes the interest that is primarily attributable to the outstanding PDP balances as a percentage of the related debt on which interest is incurred. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of a long-term asset and is the amount which theoretically could have been avoided had we not paid PDPs for the related aircraft or engines. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily relates to the interest incurred on long-term debt.\nInterest Income. For 2020, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as interest earned on income tax refunds. For 2019, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For 2018, interest income represents interest income earned on cash, cash\nequivalents, short-term investments and on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our Series 2017-1 EETC.\nOther Expense. Other expense primarily includes realized gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Non-operating. We had no special charges, non-operating in 2020 and 2019. For 2018, special charges, non-operating represents interest related to an aircraft purchase agreement for the acquisition of 14 A319 aircraft previously operated under operating leases. The contract was deemed a lease modification which resulted in a change of classification from operating leases to finance leases, until the purchase date of the aircraft. Please see \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-5. Special Charges and Credits\" for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nAbility to Execute our Growth Strategy. Over recent years, we have pursued a high-growth strategy, which we expect to continue. Execution of such a strategy requires us to effectively deploy new flying into our network, as new routes or increased frequency of existing routes develop. New flying may not perform as well as expected or may result in a competitive reaction. Moreover, our growth strategy depends on the timely delivery of aircraft and engines in accordance with the intended delivery schedule in accordance with the applicable agreement. Delivery delays, as we have experienced from time to time in recent years, may cause us to scale back our growth, unless we are able to replace delayed aircraft in the secondary market or otherwise. Finally, our growth strategy relies in part on our ability to obtain additional facilities in airports, some of which are constrained, as well as additional flight crew, maintenance, and other personnel. We expect to experience an increase in our compensation expense to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nAbility to Maintain or Grow Capacity. We pursue a high-growth strategy that expands revenue and maintains lower cost due to economies of scale and lower initial expense for aircraft and labor. Execution of such a strategy depends on the ability to maintain efficient utilization of existing capacity and the timely delivery of new aircraft and engines. In recent years, we have experienced aircraft operational reliability and delivery delays particularly regarding our A320neo aircraft. The new generation aircraft provide fuel burn and other efficiencies, as compared to the older A320ceo aircraft, and the ability to serve additional markets with greater operating range. However, ongoing or expanded reliability and delivery issues could materially impact our operations, costs and net results.\nImpact of COVID-19. During 2020, we experienced sharp declines in passenger demand and bookings beginning in March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we had unprecedented levels of cancellations and refunds. Our operations for 2020 were adversely affected by the reduction in air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the sudden and significant reduction in air travel demand, our load factor significantly decreased beginning in the latter part of March 2020 and remained as such through the remainder of the year. We continued to experience weak passenger demand and bookings during the last three quarters of 2020 driving a significant decrease in capacity and operating revenues, year over year. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our financial and operational outlook remains subject to change. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial condition, and to implement and adapt mitigation strategies while working to preserve our cash and protect our long-term sustainability. For more detailed information on the impact of COVID-19, please refer to \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-2. Impact of COVID-19.\"\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target\npromotions and frequent flyer initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods in efforts to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nMoreover, the network carriers have developed a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting may have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of high-cost carriers but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of corporate and less price-sensitive travelers. Refer to Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Industry-We operate in an extremely competitive industry.\"\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represents one of our largest operating expenses, as it does for most airlines. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives and we have not engaged in fuel derivative activity since 2015. As of December 31, 2020, we purchased a majority of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have five union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 82% of our employees at December 31, 2020. Our pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association, or PAFCA, our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW, and our passenger service agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union, or TWU. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages.\nDuring 2017, we experienced operational disruption from pilot-related work action which adversely impacted our results. We obtained a temporary restraining order to enjoin further illegal labor action. In January 2018, under the guidance of the NMB assigned mediators, the parties reached a tentative agreement. In February 2018, the pilot group voted to approve the current five-year agreement with us. In connection with the current agreement, we incurred a one-time ratification incentive of $80.2 million, including payroll taxes, and an $8.5 million adjustment related to other contractual provisions. These amounts were recorded in special charges (credits) within operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn March 2016, under the supervision of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight attendants, which becomes amendable May 2021.\nOur dispatchers are represented by the PAFCA. In June 2018, we commenced negotiations with PAFCA for an amended agreement with our dispatchers. In October 2018, PAFCA and the Company reached a tentative agreement for a new five-year agreement, which was ratified by the PAFCA members in October 2018.\nIn July 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms. In June 2016, we reached an agreement on the remaining terms of the collective bargaining agreement. In February 2020, the IAMAW notified us, as required by the Railway Labor Act, that it intends to submit proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement covering our ramp service agents, which became amendable in June 2020. The parties expect to schedule meeting dates for negotiations soon.\nIn June 2018, our passenger service agents voted to be represented by the TWU, but the representation only applies to our Fort Lauderdale station where we have direct employees in the passenger service classification. We began meeting with the TWU in late October 2018 to negotiate an initial collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we continued to negotiate with the TWU.\nWe believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. This law may be repealed in its entirety or certain aspects may be changed or replaced. If the law is repealed or modified or if new legislation is passed, such action could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense generally increases each year mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. However, in 2020, maintenance expense decreased year over year mainly as a result of decreased aircraft utilization due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As our fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time particularly in the current period given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our airline.\nAs a result of a majority of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on certain aircraft will overlap, meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations on certain aircraft at roughly the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods.\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nLoyalty Mileage Credits earned with Co-branded credit card. Customers may earn mileage credits based on their spending with our co-branded credit card company with which we have an agreement to sell mileage credits. The contract to sell mileage credits under this agreement has multiple performance obligations. The agreement provides for joint marketing and we account for this agreement consistently with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. The value is allocated based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consists of (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. We determined the best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\") for the award travel obligation, (3) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (4) advertising and marketing efforts.\nWe defer the amount for award travel obligation as part of loyalty deferred revenue within air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily marketing components, is recorded in other revenue as miles are delivered. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash sales from this agreement were $33.2 million and $48.1 million, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations.\nAircraft Maintenance Deposits. Some of our aircraft and engine master lease agreements provide that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities. These lease agreements generally provide that maintenance reserves are reimbursable to us upon completion of the maintenance event. A majority of these maintenance reserve payments are calculated based on a utilization measure, such as flight hours or cycles, and are used solely to collateralize the lessor for maintenance time run off the aircraft until the completion of the maintenance of the aircraft.\nMaintenance reserve payments are reflected as aircraft maintenance deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We make certain assumptions to determine the recoverability of maintenance deposits. These assumptions are based on various factors such as the estimated time between the maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft is estimated before it is returned to the lessor. When it is not probable we will recover amounts currently on deposit with a lessor, such amounts are expensed as supplemental rent.\nSupplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors that are not probable of being reimbursed and probable and estimable return condition obligations. We expensed $3.3 million and $4.8 million of supplemental rent recorded within aircraft rent during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We did not expense any paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent in 2020. During 2019, we expensed $0.5 million of paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had aircraft maintenance deposits of $126.3 million and $170.6 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\nLeased Aircraft Return Costs. Our aircraft lease agreements often contain provisions that require us to return aircraft airframes and engines to the lessor in a certain condition or pay an amount to the lessor based on the airframe and engine's actual return condition. Lease return costs include all costs that would be incurred at the return of the aircraft, including costs incurred to repair the airframe and engines to the required condition as stipulated by the lease. Lease return costs are recognized beginning when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated. When costs become both probable and estimable, they are accrued as a component of supplemental rent, through the remaining lease term.\nWhen determining the need to accrue lease return costs, there are various factors which need to be considered such as the contractual terms of the lease agreement, current condition of the aircraft, the age of the aircraft at lease expiration, and projected number of hours run on the engine at the time of return, among others. In addition, typically near the lease return date, the lessors may allow reserves to be applied as return condition consideration or pass on certain return provisions if they do not align with their current plans to remarket the aircraft. As a result of the different factors listed above, management assesses the need to accrue lease return costs periodically throughout the year or whenever facts and circumstances warrant an assessment.\nLease return costs will generally be estimable closer to the end of the lease term but may be estimable earlier in the lease term depending on the contractual terms of the lease agreement and the timing of maintenance events for a particular aircraft. As a result of COVID-19, we are currently operating our aircraft at lower utilization levels. If we continue flying our aircraft at lower utilization levels beyond our current projections, the timing of future maintenance events may change such that we will be required to accrue lease return costs and/or record reserves against our maintenance deposits earlier than we would have expected and such amounts could be significant. We expect lease return costs and unrecoverable maintenance deposits will increase as individual aircraft lease agreements approach their respective termination dates and we begin to accrue the estimated cost of return conditions for the corresponding aircraft. Upon a termination of the lease due to a breach by us, we would be liable for standard contractual damages, possibly including damages suffered by the lessor in connection with remarketing the aircraft or while the aircraft is not leased to another party.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2020, we generated operating revenues of $1,810.0 million and had an operating loss of $507.8 million resulting in a negative operating margin of 28.1% and a net loss of $428.7 million. In 2019, we generated operating revenues of $3,830.5 million and operating income of $501.0 million resulting in a 13.1% operating margin and net income of $335.3 million. The decrease in operating revenues, year over year, is primarily due to reduced air travel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March and continuing through the remainder of the year. The length and severity of the reduction in air travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain. We expect air travel demand recovery will continue to be volatile and will fluctuate in the upcoming months until the global pandemic has moderated and demand for air travel returns.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents was $1,789.7 million, an increase of $810.8 million compared to the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents is generally driven by cash from our operating activities offset by cash used to fund PDPs and capital expenditures. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mostly driven by cash provided from financing activities primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and warrants as well as funds received in connection with the PSP. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, as"}
