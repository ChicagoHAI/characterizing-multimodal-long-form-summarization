Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the headings Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness\nWalker & Dunlop, Inc. is a holding company, and we conduct the majority of our operations through Walker & Dunlop, LLC, our operating company.\nWe are one of the leading commercial real estate services and finance companies in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending, debt brokerage, and property sales. We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products to owners and developers of commercial real estate across the country, provide multifamily property sales brokerage services in various regions throughout the United States, and engage in commercial real estate investment management activities.\nWe originate and sell multifamily loans through the programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and HUD, with which we have licenses and long-established relationships. We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on nearly all loans that we originate for the Agencies' programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer nationally for Conventional, Seniors Housing, and Targeted Affordable Housing, a HUD MAP lender nationally, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender nationally, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. We broker and service loans for several life insurance companies, CMBS issuers, commercial banks, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker.\nWe fund loans for the Agencies' programs, generally through warehouse facility financings, and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment, which we obtain at rate lock. Proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility. The sale of the loan is typically completed within 60 days after the loan is closed, and we retain the right to service substantially all of these loans. In cases where we do not fund the loan, we act as a loan broker and service some of the loans. Our mortgage bankers who focus on loan brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders to find the most appropriate loan. These loans are then funded directly by the institutional lender, and for those brokered loans we service, we collect ongoing servicing fees while those loans remain in our servicing portfolio. The servicing fees we typically earn on brokered loan transactions are substantially lower than the servicing fees we earn for servicing Agency loans.\nWe recognize revenue when we make simultaneous commitments to originate a loan to a borrower and sell that loan to an investor. The revenues earned reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees, premiums on the sale of loans, net of any co-broker fees, and the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with servicing the loans, net of any guaranty obligations retained. We also recognize revenue when we receive the origination fee from a brokered loan transaction. Other sources of revenue include (i) net warehouse interest income we earn while the loan is held for sale through one of our warehouse facilities, (ii) net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment while they are outstanding, (iii) sales commissions for brokering the sale of multifamily properties, and (iv) asset management fees from our investment management activities.\nWe retain servicing rights on substantially all the loans we originate and sell, and generate revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans, from the interest income on escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers, and from other ancillary fees. Servicing fees set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan and are based on the unpaid principal balance of the loan. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac servicing arrangements generally provide for prepayment fees to us in the event of a voluntary prepayment. For loans serviced outside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we typically do not share in any such payments.\nWe are currently not exposed to unhedged interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing, and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated concurrently with establishing the coupon rate for\nthe loan. We also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing. We have agreements in place with the Agencies that specify the cost of a failed loan delivery, in the event we fail to deliver the loan to the investor. To protect us against such fees, we require a deposit from the borrower at rate lock that is typically more than the potential fee. The deposit is returned to the borrower only once the loan is closed. Any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost. We are also protected contractually from an investor's failure to purchase the loan. We have experienced an immaterial number of failed deliveries in our history and have incurred immaterial losses on such failed deliveries.\nWe have risk-sharing obligations on substantially all loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. When a Fannie Mae DUS loan is subject to full risk-sharing, we absorb losses on the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the original unpaid principal balance of the loan (subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within 12 months of its sale to Fannie Mae), except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. We occasionally request modified risk-sharing based on the size of the loan. During the second quarter of 2018, Fannie Mae increased our risk-sharing cap from $60.0 million to $200.0 million. Accordingly, our maximum loss exposure on any one loan is $40.0 million (such exposure would occur if the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fairly compensated for the risks of the transaction. Our servicing fees for risk-sharing loans include compensation for the risk-sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we receive from Fannie Mae for loans with no risk-sharing obligations.\nOur Interim Program offers floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of generally up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing. We underwrite, asset-manage, and service all loans executed through the Interim Program. The ultimate goal of the Interim Program is to provide permanent Agency financing on these transition properties. The Interim Program has two distinct executions: held by the Interim Program JV and held for investment.\nThe Interim Program JV assumes full risk of loss while the loans it originates are outstanding. We hold a 15% ownership interest in the Interim Program JV and are responsible for sourcing, underwriting, servicing, and asset-managing the loans originated by the joint venture. The joint venture funds its operations using a combination of equity contributions from its owners and third-party credit facilities.\nWe originate and hold some Interim Program loans for investment, which are included on our balance sheet. During the time that these loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss. Since we began originating interim loans, we have not charged off any Interim Program loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had 22 loans held for investment under the Interim Program with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of $546.6 million. One loan, totaling $14.7 million, is currently in default, and we are working with the borrower to restructure the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $436.1 million of the $757.2 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture, with the remainder originated through our Interim Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $350.0 million of the $993.1 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we asset-managed $670.5 million and $334.6 million, respectively of interim loans on behalf of the Interim Program JV.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we transferred a $70.1 million portfolio of participating interests in loans held for investment to a third party and accounted for the transfer as a secured borrowing. The balance of the portfolio is presented as loans held for investment with an offsetting amount for the secured borrowing included as account payable as of December 31, 2019. We do not have credit risk related to the transferred loans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a $150.0 million participation in a subordinated note with a large institutional investor in multifamily loans and presented as loans held for investment. The participation was fully funded with corporate cash and has been paid down to $7.8 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019, the borrower repaid principal of $142.2 million, and the remaining $7.8 million was repaid in February2020.\nThrough WDIS, we offer property sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell these properties. Through these property sales brokerage services, we seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients using our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and relying on our experienced transaction professionals. Our property sales services are offered in various regions throughout the United States. We have added several property sales brokerage teams over the past few years and continue to seek to add other property sales brokers, with the goal of expanding these services to cover all major regions throughout the United States. We consolidate the activities of WDIS and present the portion of WDIS that we do not control as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Net income from noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company acquired JCR, the operator, registered investment adviser, and general partner of private commercial real estate investment funds focused on the management of debt, preferred equity, and mezzanine equity investments in private middle-market commercial real estate funds and separately managed accounts. The acquisition of JCR, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is part of our strategy to grow and diversify the company by growing our investment management platform. JCR's current assets under management ( AUM\u201d) of $1.2 billion primarily consist of assets held in three managed funds: Fund III, Fund IV, Fund V, and separate accounts managed for life insurance companies. AUM for Fund III and Fund IV consist of both unfunded commitments and funded investments, AUM for Fund V consists of unfunded commitments, and AUM for the separate accounts consist entirely of funded investments. Unfunded commitments are highest during the fund raising and investment phases. AUM disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from regulatory assets under management disclosed on JCR's Form ADV.\nJCR typically receives management fees based on limited partner capital commitments, unfunded investment commitments, and funded investments. Additionally, with respect to Fund III, Fund IV, and Fund V, JCR receives a percentage of the profits above the fund expenses and preferred return specified in the fund offering agreements.\nOver the past several years, we have purchased the rights to service HUD loans with an aggregate $4.3 billion unpaid principal balance from third-party servicers for a total of $52.7 million. The acquisition of these servicing rights substantially increased our HUD servicing portfolio and led to our being one of the largest servicers of HUD commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2019. We expect the servicing rights acquisitions to have the following benefits:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>reduce the average cost to service each loan as we leverage our existing servicing platform, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>provide new borrower relationships, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>provide opportunities for additional loan origination volume when these loans mature or prepay, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>produce a stable stream of cash revenues over the estimated lives of the portfolios. </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2019, our servicing portfolio was $93.2 billion, up 9% from December 31, 2018, making it the 7th largest commercial/multifamily primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Mortgage Bankers' Association's ( MBA\u201d) 2019 year-end survey (the Survey\u201d). Our servicing portfolio includes $40.0 billion of loans serviced for Fannie Mae and $32.6 billion for Freddie Mac, making us the 2nd and 3rd largest primary cashier servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in the nation, respectively, according to the Survey. Also included in our servicing portfolio is $10.0 billion of HUD loans, the 2nd largest HUD primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Survey.\nThe average number of our mortgage bankers increased from 138 during 2018 to 150 during 2019 due to organic growth, contributing to an increase of 5% in our loan origination volume, from a total of $25.3 billion during 2018 to a total of $26.6 billion during 2019. Fannie Mae recently announced that we ranked as its largest DUS lender in 2019, by loan deliveries, and Freddie Mac recently announced that we ranked as its 3rd largest Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer in 2019, by loan deliveries. Additionally, we were the third largest multifamily lender for HUD in 2019 based on MAP initial endorsements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights ( MSRs\u201d). MSRs are recorded at fair value at loan sale or upon purchase. The fair value of MSRs acquired through a stand-alone servicing portfolio purchase ( PMSR\u201d) is equal to the purchase price paid. The fair value at loan sale ( OMSR\u201d) is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights and takes into consideration an estimate of loan prepayment. Initially, the fair value amount is included as a component of the derivative asset fair value at the loan commitment date. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the OMSR over the estimated life of the underlying loan. The discount rates used throughout the periods presented for all OMSRs were between 10-15% and varied based on the loan type. The life of the underlying loan is estimated giving consideration to the prepayment provisions in the loan. Our model for OMSRs assumes no prepayment while the prepayment provisions have not expired and full prepayment of the loan at or near the point where the prepayment provisions have expired. We record an individual OMSR asset (or liability) for each loan at loan sale. For PMSRs, we record and amortize a portfolio-level MSR asset based on the estimated remaining life of the portfolio using the prepayment characteristics of the portfolio. We have had three stand-alone servicing portfolio purchases, one each in 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of OMSRs are based on internal models and are periodically compared to assumptions used by other market participants. Due to the relatively few transactions in the multifamily MSR market, we have experienced little volatility in the assumptions we used during the periods presented, including the most-significant assumption - the discount rate. Additionally, we do not expect to see significant volatility in the assumptions for the foreseeable future. Management actively monitors the assumptions used and makes adjustments to those assumptions when market conditions change or other factors indicate such adjustments are warranted. We carry OMRSs and PMSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and evaluate the carrying value for impairment quarterly. We test for impairment on PMSRs separately from OMSRs. The PMSRs and OMSRs are tested for impairment at the portfolio level. We have never recorded an impairment of MSRs in our history. We engage a third party to assist in determining an estimated fair value of our existing and outstanding MSRs on at least a semi-annual basis.\nRevenue is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The commitment asset related to the loan origination is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and sale premiums, net of any co-broker fees, and the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, net of the estimated net future cash flows associated with any risk-sharing obligations (the servicing component of the commitment asset\u201d). Upon loan sale, we derecognize the servicing component of the commitment asset and recognize an OMSR. All OMSRs are amortized into expense using the interest method over the estimated life of the loan and presented as a component of Amortization and depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor OMSRs, the individual loan-level OMSR is written off through a charge to Amortization and depreciation when a loan prepays, defaults, or is probable of default. For PMSRs, a constant rate of prepayments and defaults is included in the determination of the portfolio's estimated life (and thus included as a component of the portfolio's amortization). Accordingly, prepayments and defaults of individual loans do not change the level of amortization expense recorded for the portfolio unless the pattern of actual prepayments and defaults varies significantly from the estimated pattern. When such a significant difference in the pattern of estimated and actual prepayments and defaults occurs, we prospectively adjust the estimated life of the portfolio (and thus future amortization) to approximate the actual pattern observed. We have not adjusted the estimated life of our PMSRs, as the actual prepayment experience has not differed materially from the expected prepayment experience. We do not anticipate an adjustment to the estimated life of the portfolios will be necessary in the near term due to the characteristics of the portfolios, especially the low weighted-average interest rates and the relatively long remaining periods of prepayment protection.\nAllowance for Risk-sharing Obligations. This reserve liability (referred to as allowance\u201d) for risk-sharing obligations relates to our at risk servicing portfolio and is presented as a separate liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of this allowance considers our assessment of the likelihood of repayment by the borrower or key principal(s), the risk characteristics of the loan, the loan's risk rating, historical loss experience, adverse situations affecting individual loans, the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral, and the level of risk sharing. Historically, initial loss recognition occurs at or before a loan becomes 60 days delinquent. We regularly monitor the allowance on all applicable loans and update loss estimates as current information is received. Provision (benefit) for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflects the income statement impact of changes to both the allowance for risk-sharing obligations and allowance for loan losses.\nWe perform a quarterly evaluation of all of our risk-sharing loans to determine whether a loss is probable. Our process for identifying which risk-sharing loans may be probable of loss consists of an assessment of several qualitative and quantitative factors including payment status, property financial performance, local real estate market conditions, loan-to-value ratio, debt-service-coverage ratio, and property condition. We record an allowance for risk-sharing obligations related to all risk-sharing loans on our watch list ( general reserves\u201d). Such loans are not probable of foreclosure but are probable of loss as the characteristics of these loans indicate that it is probable that these loans include some losses even though the loss cannot be attributed to a specific loan. For all other risk-sharing loans not on our watch list, we continue to carry a guaranty obligation. We calculate the general reserves based on a migration analysis of the loans on our historical watch lists, adjusted for qualitative factors that are based on the characteristics of the servicing portfolio and the current market conditions. We have not experienced volatility in the general reserves loss percentage and do not expect to experience significant volatility in the near term.\nWhen we place a risk-sharing loan on our watch list, we transfer the remaining unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation to the general reserves. If a risk-sharing loan is subsequently removed from our watch list due to improved financial performance, we transfer the unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation back to the guaranty obligation classification on the balance sheet and amortize the remaining unamortized balance evenly over the remaining estimated life. For each loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation, we record one of the following liabilities associated with that loan as discussed above: guaranty obligation, general reserve, or specific reserve. Although the liability type may change over the life of the loan, at any particular point in time, only one such liability is associated with a loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation.\nWhen we believe a loan is probable of foreclosure or when the loan is in foreclosure, we record an allowance for that loan (a specific reserve\u201d). The specific reserve is based on the estimate of the property fair value less selling and property preservation costs and considers the loss-sharing requirements detailed below in the Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations\u201d section. The estimate of property fair value at initial recognition of the allowance for risk-sharing obligations is based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value. The allowance for risk-sharing obligations for such loans is updated as any additional information is received until the loss is settled with Fannie Mae. The settlement with Fannie Mae is based on the actual sales price of the property and selling and property preservation costs and considers the Fannie Mae loss-sharing requirements. Loss settlement with Fannie Mae has historically concluded within 18 to 36 months after foreclosure. Historically, the initial specific reserves have not varied significantly from the final settlement. We are uncertain whether such a trend will continue in the future.\nOverview of Current Business Environment\nThe fundamentals of the commercial real estate market remain strong. For the last two years, multifamily debt financing activity has represented at least 80% of our total mortgage banking volumes and has been a meaningful driver of our operating performance. Multifamily occupancy rates and effective rents remain strong based upon robust rental market demand while delinquency rates remain at historic lows, all of which aid loan performance and debt financing volumes due to their importance to the cash flows of the underlying properties. Additionally, the headwinds facing single-family home ownership, including high valuations and limited supply, have led to home ownership levels at or near historic lows over the past few years. At the same time, new household formation continues to grow, unemployment levels remain at historic lows, and macroeconomic indicators are strong, all resulting in high demand for multifamily housing.\nThe Mortgage Bankers' Association ( MBA\u201d) recently reported that the amount of commercial and multifamily mortgage debt outstanding continued to grow in the third quarter of 2019, reaching $3.6 trillion, an increase of $75.7 billion (2.2%) from the second quarter of 2019. Multifamily mortgage debt outstanding rose by $40.6 billion to $1.5 trillion as of the end of the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.8% from the second quarter of 2019.\nSteady household formation and a dearth of supply of entry-level single-family homes have led to strong demand for rental housing and continued increasing rents for multifamily properties in most markets. The positive performance has boosted the value of many multifamily properties towards the high end of historical ranges. According to RealPage, a provider of commercial real estate data and analytics, rent growth continued to increase at an average annual pace of 3.0% during the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupancy rates fell slightly to 95.8%, from a near all-time high of 96.3% in the third quarter of 2019. We believe that the market demand for multifamily housing in the upcoming quarters will continue to absorb most of the capacity created by new construction and that vacancy rates will remain near historic lows, continuing to make multifamily properties an attractive investment option.\nIn addition to the healthy property fundamentals, for the last several years, the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage market has experienced historically low cost of borrowing, which has further encouraged capital investment into commercial real estate. As borrowers have sought to take advantage of the interest rate environment and strong property fundamentals, the number of investors and amount of capital available to lend have increased. All of these factors have benefited our total transaction volumes over the past several years. Competition for lending on commercial and multifamily real estate among commercial real estate services firms, banks, life insurance companies, and the GSEs remains fierce.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 and by 25 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2019 and changed the target rate to 1.50% - 1.75%. Prior to the rate decreases starting in the third quarter of 2019, the rate had increased 125 basis points over the previous two years. Long-term mortgage interest rates, which form the basis for most of our lending, have remained at relatively low levels throughout this period and have resulted in a flattened yield curve. There remains a significant amount of capital investing in U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily properties resulting from historically low global interest rates and the strong fundamentals of the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily market.\nWe expect to see continued strength in the multifamily financing market for the foreseeable future due to the underlying fundamentals of the multifamily market as the labor market remains strong, single-family home ownership remains unaffordable for many households, and new household formation fuels rental demand.\nWe are a market-leading originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA\u201d) establishes loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each year. In September 2019, FHFA revised Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's loan origination caps to $100.0 billion each for all multifamily business for the five-quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020. The new caps apply to all multifamily business with no exclusions.\nThe GSEs reported combined loan origination volume of approximately $148.5 billion in 2019 compared to $143.3 billion during 2018, an increase of 3.6%, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac volumes growing 7.5% and 0.4%, respectively. We expect the GSEs to maintain their historical market share in a multifamily origination market that is projected by the MBA on average to be $390 billion in 2020. We believe our market leadership positions us to be a significant lender with the GSEs for the foreseeable future. Our originations with the GSEs are some of our most profitable executions as they provide significant non-cash gains from MSRs that turn into significant cash revenue streams in the future. A decline in our GSE originations would negatively impact our financial results as our non-cash revenues would decrease disproportionately with loan origination volume and future servicing fee revenue would be constrained or decline.\nWe continue to significantly grow our debt brokerage platform through hiring and acquisitions to gain greater access to capital, deal flow, and borrower relationships. The apparent appetite for debt funding within the broader commercial real estate market, along with the significant additions of mortgage bankers over the past several years, has resulted in significant growth in our brokered debt financing volume with a 40% increase in brokered debt financing volume from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our outlook for our debt brokerage platform is positive as we expect\ncontinued growth in the commercial and multifamily financing markets in the near future, and we expect to continue adding debt brokers to our platform.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the U.S. government was shut down for approximately one month, during which time HUD processed no loan commitments. The shutdown negatively impacted the amount of loan originations at HUD, which contributed to a decrease of 15% of 2019 originations compared to 2018. HUD remains a strong source of capital for new construction loans and healthcare facilities. We expect that HUD will continue to be a meaningful supplier of capital to our borrowers. We continue to seek to add resources and scale to our HUD lending platform, particularly in the area of construction lending, seniors housing, and skilled nursing, where HUD remains an important provider of capital.\nMany of our borrowers continue to seek higher returns by identifying and acquiring the transitional properties that the Interim Program is designed to address. We entered into the Interim Program JV to both increase the overall capital available to transitional properties and dramatically expand our capacity to originate Interim Program loans. The demand for transitional lending has brought increased competition from lenders, specifically banks, mortgage real estate investment trusts, and life insurance companies. All are actively pursuing transitional properties by leveraging their low cost of capital and desire for short-term, floating-rate, high-yield commercial real estate investments. We originated $935.9 million of interim loans during 2019 compared to $1.2 billion during 2018.\nWe saw increased activity in our multifamily-focused property sales platform in 2019 compared to 2018 as the macroeconomic conditions in 2019 continued to make multifamily properties an attractive investment, and we added 20 new property sales brokers to our platform during the year. We expect to continue adding to our property sales team in the future as we continue our efforts to expand the platform more broadly across the United States and to increase the size of our property sales team to capture what we believe will be strong multifamily property sales activity over the coming years.\nFactors That May Impact Our Operating Results\nWe believe that our results are affected by a number of factors, including the items discussed below.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Performance of Multifamily and Other Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to long-term mortgage interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions and the continued existence of the GSEs. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during stronger economic environments, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes, and loan origination volumes. During weaker economic environments, multifamily and other commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations, as well as an increased level of servicer advances and losses from our Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations and our interim lending program. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Level of Losses from Fannie Mae Risk-Sharing Obligations. Under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we share risk of loss on most loans we sell to Fannie Mae. In the majority of cases, we absorb the first 5% of any losses on the loan's unpaid principal balance at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the loan's unpaid principal balance on the origination date, except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. As a result, a rise in defaults could have a material adverse effect on us. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Price of Loans in the Secondary Market. Our profitability is determined in part by the price we are paid for the loans we originate. A component of our origination related revenues is the premium we recognize on the sale of a loan. Stronger investor demand typically results in larger premiums while weaker demand results in little to no premium. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Market for Servicing Commercial Real Estate Loans. Servicing fee rates for new loans are set at the time we enter into a loan sale commitment based on origination fees, competition, prepayment rates, and any risk- </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>sharing obligations we undertake. Changes in servicing fee rates impact the value of our MSRs and future servicing revenues, which could impact our profit margins and operating results immediately and over time. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Percentage of Adjustable Rate Loans Originated and the Overall Loan Origination Mix. The adjustable rate mortgage loans ( ARMs\u201d) we originate typically have less stringent prepayment protection features than fixed rate mortgage loans ( FRMs\u201d), resulting in a shorter expected life for ARMs than FRMs. The shorter expected life for ARMs results in smaller MSRs recorded than for FRMs. Absent an increase in originations, an increase in the proportion of our loans originated that are ARMs could adversely impact the gains from mortgage banking activities we record. Additionally, the loan product mix we originate can significantly impact our overall earnings. For example, an increase in loan origination volume for our two highest-margin products, Fannie Mae and HUD loans, without a change in total loan origination volume would increase our overall profitability, while a decrease in the loan origination volume of these two products without a change in total loan origination volume would decrease our overall profitability, all else equal. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nLoan Origination and Debt Brokerage Fees, net. Revenue related to the loan origination fee is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell to an investor or when a loan that we broker closes with the institutional lender. The commitment asset related to the loan origination fee is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and any sale premiums, net of co-broker fees. Also included in revenues from loan origination activities are changes to the fair value of loan commitments, forward sale commitments, and loans held for sale that occur during their respective holding periods. Upon sale of the loans, no gains or losses are recognized as such loans are recorded at fair value during their holding periods.\nBrokered loans tend to have lower origination fees because they often require less time to execute, there is more competition for brokerage assignments, and because the borrower will also have to pay an origination fee to the institutional lender.\nPremiums received on the sale of a loan result when a loan is sold to an investor for more than its face value. There are various reasons investors may pay a premium when purchasing a loan. For example, the fixed rate on the loan may be higher than the rate of return required by an investor or the characteristics of a particular loan may be desirable to an investor. We do not receive premiums on brokered loans.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nFair Value of Expected Net Cash Flows from Servicing, net. Revenue related to expected net cash flows from servicing is recognized at the loan commitment date, similar to the loan origination fees, as described above. The derivative asset is recognized at fair value, which reflects the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, reduced by the estimated fair value of any guaranty obligations to be assumed. OMSRs and guaranty obligations are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, upon the sale of the loans.\nOMSRs are recorded at fair value upon loan sale. The fair value is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the MSR over the estimated life of the loan.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nServicing Fees. We service nearly all loans we originate and some loans we broker. We earn servicing fees for performing certain loan servicing functions such as processing loan, tax, and insurance payments and managing escrow balances. Servicing generally also includes asset management functions, such as monitoring the physical condition of the property, analyzing the financial condition and liquidity of the borrower, and performing loss mitigation activities as directed by the Agencies.\nOur servicing fees on loans we originate provide a stable revenue stream. They are based on contractual terms, are earned over the life of the loan, and are generally not subject to significant prepayment risk. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac servicing agreements provide for prepayment fees in the event of a voluntary prepayment. Accordingly, we currently do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk. Any prepayment fees received are included in Other revenues.\nHUD has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause. In addition to termination for cause, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee. Our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements for brokered loans at any time with or without cause, without paying a termination fee.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Sale. We earn net interest income on loans funded through borrowings from our warehouse facilities from the time the loan is closed until the loan is sold pursuant to the loan purchase agreement. Each borrowing on a warehouse line relates to a specific loan for which we have already secured a loan sale commitment with an investor. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for sale varies based on the period of time between the loan closing and the sale of the loan to the investor, the size of the average balance of the loans held for sale, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. Loans may remain in the warehouse facility for up to 60 days, but the average time in the warehouse facility is approximately 30 days. As a short-term cash management tool, we may also use excess corporate cash to fund Agency loans on our balance sheet rather than borrowing against a warehouse line. Loans that we broker for institutional investors and other investors are funded directly by them; therefore, there is no warehouse interest income or expense associated with brokered loan transactions. Additionally, the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our Agency warehouse lines is included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for sale.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Investment. Similar to loans held for sale, we earn net interest income on loans held for investment during the period they are outstanding. We earn interest income on the loan, which is funded partially by an investment of our cash and through one of our interim warehouse credit facilities. The loans originated for investment are typically interest-only, variable-rate loans with terms up to three years. The warehouse credit facilities are variable rate. The interest rate reset date is typically the same for the loans and the credit facility. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for investment varies based on the period of time the loans are outstanding, the size of the average balance of the loans held for investment, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. The net spread has historically not varied much. Additionally, the amortization of deferred fees and costs and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our interim warehouse lines are included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for investment. Net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment will decrease in the coming years if most, or all, of the loans originated through the Interim Program are held by the Interim Program JV.\nEscrow Earnings and Other Interest Income. We earn fee income on property-level escrow deposits in our servicing portfolio, generally based on a fixed or variable placement fee negotiated with the financial institutions that hold the escrow deposits. Escrow earnings reflect interest income net of interest paid to the borrower, if required, which generally equals a money market rate. Escrow earnings tend to increase as short-term interest rates increase as they did in 2017 and 2018 but tend to decline as short-term interest rates decrease as they did in the latter part of 2019. Also included with escrow earnings and other interest income are interest earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and interest income earned on our pledged securities. Interest income from pledged securities increased during 2019 as we sold investments in money market funds and invested those proceeds in higher-earning multifamily Agency mortgage-backed securities ( Agency MBS\u201d).\nOther revenues. Other revenues are comprised of fees for processing loan assumptions, prepayment fee income, application fees, property sales broker fees, income from equity-method investments, income from preferred equity investments, asset management fees, and other miscellaneous revenues related to our operations.\nCosts and Expenses\nPersonnel. Personnel expense includes the cost of employee compensation and benefits, which include fixed and discretionary amounts tied to company and individual performance, commissions, severance expense, signing and retention bonuses, and share-based compensation.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation is principally comprised of amortization of our MSRs, net of amortization of our guaranty obligations. The MSRs are amortized using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received. We amortize the guaranty obligations evenly over their expected lives. When the loan underlying an OMSR prepays, we write off the remaining unamortized balance, net of any related guaranty obligation, and record the write off to Amortization and depreciation. Similarly, when the loan underlying an OMSR defaults, we write the OMSR off to Amortization and depreciation. We depreciate property, plant, and equipment ratably over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization and depreciation also includes the amortization of intangible assets, principally related to the amortization of the mortgage pipeline and other intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions. We recognize amortization related to the mortgage pipeline intangible asset when a loan included in the mortgage pipeline intangible asset is rate locked or is no longer probable of rate locking. Also included in amortization and depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR. These intangible assets consisted primarily of asset management contracts, which had an estimated life at acquisition of five years. For the years presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR in 2018.\nProvision (Benefit) for Credit Losses. The provision (benefit) for credit losses consists of two components: the provision associated with our risk-sharing loans and the provision associated with our loans held for investment. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with risk-sharing loans is established at the loan level when the borrower has defaulted on the loan or is probable of defaulting on the loan or collectively for loans that are not probable of default but on a watch list. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with our loans held for investment is established collectively for loans that are not impaired and individually for loans that are impaired. Our estimates of property fair value are based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value.\nInterest Expense on Corporate Debt. Interest expense on corporate debt includes interest expense incurred and amortization of debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs related to our term loan facility.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include sub-servicing costs, facilities costs, travel and entertainment costs, marketing costs, professional fees, license fees, dues and subscriptions, corporate insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company is a C-corporation subject to both federal and state corporate tax. As of December 31, 2019, our estimated combined statutory federal and state tax rate was approximately 25.0% compared to approximately 25.1% as of December 31, 2018 and 38.2% as of December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal income tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. Except for the effects of Tax Reform, our combined statutory tax rate has historically not varied significantly as the only material difference in the calculation of the combined statutory tax rate from year to year is the apportionment of our taxable income amongst the various states where we are subject to taxation since we do not have foreign operations or significant permanent differences. For example, from the period since we went public in 2010 through 2017, our combined statutory tax rate varied by only 0.7%, with a low of 38.2% and a high of 38.9%. Absent additional significant legislative changes to statutory tax rates (particularly the federal tax rate), we expect minimal deviation from the 2019 combined statutory tax rate for future years. However, we do expect some variability in the effective tax rate going forward due to excess tax benefits recognized and limitations on the deductibility of certain book expenses as a result of Tax Reform, primarily related to executive compensation.\nExcess tax benefits recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reduced income tax expense by $4.6 million, $6.8 million, and $9.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the excess tax benefits from 2017 to 2018 related primarily to the aforementioned reduction in the combined statutory tax rate due to Tax Reform. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 largely reflects the limited deductibility of excess tax benefits related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our annual results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future, reflecting the interest-rate environment, the volume of transactions, business acquisitions, regulatory actions, and general economic conditions.

note 2 to the table below) due primarily to an increase in debt financing volume, (ii) servicing fees due to a year-over-year increase in the average servicing portfolio, (iii) net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment due to a substantially higher average balance of loans held for investment year over year, (iv) escrow earnings and other interest income principally related to increases in the escrow balances of loans serviced and the annual average escrow earnings rate, (v) property sales broker fees as a result of a nearly doubling of property sales volume year over year, and (vi) other revenues primarily from an increase in prepayment fees. Partially offsetting the increases in other revenue streams was a decrease in net warehouse interest income from loans held for sale due to a lower net interest spread on loans held for sale year over year.\nThe increase in total expenses was due primarily to increases in (i) personnel expense mostly due to increases in salaries expense resulting from a rise in average headcount year over year and commissions costs due to the increases in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net and property sales broker fees, (ii) amortization and depreciation costs due to an increase in the average balance of MSRs outstanding year over year, (iii) provision for credit losses due to three loan defaults in 2019 compared to none in 2018, and (iv) other operating expenses due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the average headcount and an increase in recruiting costs.\nRevenues\nThe following table provides additional information that helps explain changes in origination fees and mortgage servicing rights over the past three years:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Financing Volume by Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freddie Mac\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae -

The increase in MSR income is principally related to the increase in debt financing volume.\nSee the Overview of Current Business Environment\u201d section above for a detailed discussion of the factors driving the changes in debt financing volumes.\nServicing Fees. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average servicing portfolio from 2018 to 2019 as shown below due primarily to new loan originations and relatively few payoffs. Partially offsetting the increase in servicing fees due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio was a decrease in the servicing portfolio's weighted\naverage servicing fee as shown below primarily because the weighted-average servicing fee on our new Fannie Mae originations was less than the weighted-average servicing fee of Fannie Mae loans that matured or pre-paid during 2019.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Servicing Fees Details\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Servicing Portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,633,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,635,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,072,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 10,997,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,563,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Servicing Fee (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Sale ( LHFS\u201d). The decrease was largely the result of a decrease in the average balance and a significant decrease in the net spread as shown below. The decrease in the net spread was the result of a greater increase in the short-term interest rates on which our borrowings are based than in the long-term interest rates on which the majority of our loans held for sale are based, principally during the first nine months of 2019.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Warehouse Interest Income Details - LHFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average LHFS Outstanding Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,108,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,310,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,613,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (201,644)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (303,309)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LHFS Net Spread (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Investment ( LHFI\u201d). The increase was due to the substantial increase in the average balance of loans held for investment outstanding from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the average balance was due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio. If we originate the majority of our interim loans through the Interim Program JV, net warehouse interest income from LHFI will be lower than if we originate them entirely through the Interim Program. Such a decrease in net warehouse interest income from LHFI would be partially offset by our portion of the net income generated by the Interim Program JV. Additionally, a large loan that was fully funded with corporate cash paid off in the first quarter of 2020.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Warehouse Interest Income Details - LHFI\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average LHFI Outstanding Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>402,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 265,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (75,316)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LHFI Net Spread (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 444\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Escrow Earnings and Other Interest Income. The increase was due to increases in both the average balance of escrow accounts and the average earnings rate from 2018 to 2019. The increase in the average balance was due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio. The increase in the average earnings rate was due to the increase in short-term interest rates upon which our earnings rates are based, principally during the first nine months of 2019.\nProperty Sales Broker Fees. The increase in 2019 was the result of a substantial increase in property sales volume due largely to additions of property sales brokers over the past year and the favorable property sales market in 2019 as more fully discussed above in the Overview of Current Business Environment\u201d section.\nOther Revenues. The increase was primarily related to a $7.9 million increase in prepayment fees as more of the loans in our servicing portfolio paid off during 2019 than in 2018 and a $1.0 million increase in income from the Interim\nJV due to an increased balance of Interim JV loans outstanding during 2019, partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in income from preferred equity investments as we did not have any preferred equity investments outstanding during 2019.\nExpenses\nPersonnel. The increase was primarily the result of a $16.3 million increase in salaries and benefits due to hiring to support our growth, resulting in a 14% increase in the average headcount from 671 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 765 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, commission costs increased $24.8 million due to the increases in origination fees and property sales broker fees detailed above. Lastly, subjective bonus expense increased $6.4 million due to the aforementioned increase in average headcount and due our improved financial performance year over year.\nAmortization and Depreciation. The increase was attributable to loan origination activity and the resulting growth in the average MSR balance outstanding from 2018 to 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we added $48.7 million of MSRs, net of amortization and write offs due to prepayment.\nProvision (Benefit) for Credit Losses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three loans defaulted, two of which were in our at-risk portfolio and resulted in specific reserves of $6.9 million. The properties related to these two at risk loans are located in the same city. The Company does not have any additional at risk loans related to properties in this geographical area. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced no defaults of any at risk loans.\nInterest Expense on Corporate Debt. The increase in the outstanding balance of our long-term debt was the primary driver of the increases in interest expense on corporate debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. We refinanced our long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2018, increasing the balance $134.6 million while reducing the spread on the interest rate by 75 basis points. We re-priced our long-term debt in December of 2019, reducing the spread by another 25 basis points.\nOther Operating Expenses. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million increase in office expenses as a result of the aforementioned increase in average headcount and new offices added in 2019 and a $2.9 million increase in recruiting costs to support the growth of our mortgage banker and property sales broker teams in 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in income tax expense related to the 8% increase in income from operations and a $2.2 million decrease in realizable excess tax benefits due to significantly fewer exercises of stock options during 2019 compared to 2018 and due to lower executive compensation deductions in 2019 relative to 2018, resulting in a 24.8% effective tax rate for 2019 compared to 24.4% in 2018.\nYear

decreases in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net, fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, and net warehouse income from loans held for sale. The increase in servicing fees was due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio. The substantial increase in escrow earnings and other interest income related to increases in the escrow balances of loans serviced and the escrow earnings rate. Other revenues increased primarily from an increase in investment management fees as we acquired JCR Capital in 2018. The decrease in fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, was due primarily to a decrease in Fannie Mae servicing fees, while the decrease in net warehouse interest income from loans held for sale was due to a lower net interest spread on loans held for sale.\nThe increase in total expenses was due primarily to increases in personnel expense mostly due to an increase in salaries expense resulting from a rise in average headcount year over year, amortization and depreciation costs due to an increase in the average balance of MSRs outstanding year over year, and other operating expenses.\nRevenues\nThe following table provides additional information that helps explain changes in origination fees and mortgage servicing rights over the past three years:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Financing Volume by Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freddie Mac\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae -

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Agency loan origination volume as a percentage of overall loan origination volume decreased to 63% from 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Agency loan originations produce higher loan origination fees than brokered and interim loan originations.\nThe decreases in MSR income and MSR rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 are related primarily to a year-over-year decrease of 14% in the weighted-average servicing fee rate on new Fannie Mae loan originations and the aforementioned change in the mix of loan origination volume. The decrease in the weighted-average servicing fee rate was due principally to increased competition for new debt financing with Fannie Mae, which resulted in tighter credit spreads and lower servicing fees.\nServicing Fees. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average servicing portfolio from 2017 to 2018 as shown below due primarily to new loan originations and relatively few payoffs. Partially offsetting the increase in servicing fees due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio was a decrease in the servicing portfolio's weighted average servicing fee as shown below primarily due to an increase in brokered loans as a percentage of the overall servicing\nportfolio as well as the aforementioned decrease in the weighted average servicing fee of new Fannie Mae loan originations.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Servicing Fees Details\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Servicing Portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,635,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,072,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,540,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,563,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,531,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Servicing Fee (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Sale. The decrease was largely the result of a decrease in the average balance and a significant decrease in the net spread as shown below. The decrease in the net spread was the result of a greater increase in the short-term interest rates on which our borrowings are based than in the long-term interest rates on which the majority of our loans held for sale are based.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Warehouse Interest Income Details - LHFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average LHFS Outstanding Balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,310,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,613,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,342,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (303,309)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 270,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LHFS Net Spread (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEscrow Earnings and Other Interest Income. The increase was due to increases in both the average balance of escrow accounts and the average earnings rate from 2017 to 2018. The increase in the average balance was due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio. The increase in the average earnings rate was due to the increase in short-term interest rates, upon which our earnings rates are based.\nOther Revenues. The increase is primarily related to a $9.0 million increase in investment management fees due to the acquisition of JCR and a $1.6 million gain from the sale of an equity-method investment for the year ended December 31, 2018 with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExpenses\nPersonnel. The increase was primarily the result of an $8.8 million increase in salaries and benefits due to acquisitions and hiring to support our growth, resulting in an increase in the average headcount from 599 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 671 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits costs was slightly offset by decreases in variable compensation costs.\nAmortization and Depreciation. The increase was attributable to loan origination activity and the resulting growth in the average MSR balance outstanding from 2017 to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added $35.4 million of MSRs, net of amortization and write offs due to prepayment.\nOther Operating Expenses. The increase in other operating expenses primarily stems from increased office expenses of $2.3 million and travel costs of $2.0 million due to the increase in average headcount year over year and increased legal expenses of $1.5 million largely in connection with our acquisitions. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to (i) a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock compensation recognized year over year, (ii) a decrease in the benefit from the enactment of Tax Reform in 2017, and (iii) a $2.8 million expense related to a 100% valuation allowance placed on certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by the decrease in income from operations and a decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate from 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Excess tax benefits reduced income tax expense by $9.5 million in 2017 compared to $6.8 million in 2018.\nAs discussed previously, Tax Reform was enacted in December 2017, reducing the federal income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. In connection with the enactment of Tax Reform, we revalued our net deferred tax liabilities using the new federal income tax rate of 21.0%. These net deferred tax liabilities decreased as the future payment of taxes from these liabilities will be less than previously expected, resulting in a decrease to income tax expense of $58.3 million. The significant reductions to income tax expense in 2017 resulted in an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 24.4% in 2018.\nBased on the information available as of December 31, 2018, we believed that it may have been more likely than not that the expense associated with certain compensation agreements for our executives would not be deductible for tax purposes in future years. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets, resulting in a $2.8 million charge to tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense on our term loan facility, and amortization and depreciation, adjusted for provision (benefit) for credit losses net of write-offs, stock-based incentive compensation charges, and fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA further includes or excludes other significant non-cash items that are not part of our ongoing operations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges that are used to determine compliance with financial covenants.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provides useful information to investors by offering:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with net income.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:\nADJUSTED FINANCIAL METRIC RECONCILIATION TO GAAP\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Walker & Dunlop Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Walker & Dunlop Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 173,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 161,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 211,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on corporate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 131,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (243)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net write-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180,766)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (172,401)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (193,886)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized issuance costs from early debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 247,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 220,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 200,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table presents a period-to-period comparison of our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nADJUSTED EBITDA -

The increase in origination fees (as defined above) was primarily related to an increase in debt financing volumes year over year. Servicing fees increased due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio period over period as a result of new debt financing volume and relatively few payoffs. The increase in net warehouse interest income was related to increased income from LHFI due to an increase in the average balance outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in net warehouse interest income from LHFS. Escrow earnings and other interest income increased as a result of increases in the average escrow balance outstanding and the average earnings rate. Other revenues increased primarily due to increases in prepayment fees and property sales broker fees.\nThe increase in personnel expense was primarily due to increased salaries and benefits expense due to a rise in headcount, commissions expense resulting from the increases in origination fees and property sales broker fees, and subjective bonus related to the rise in headcount and the improvement in the Company's financial performance year over year. Other operating expenses increased primarily as a result of increased occupancy costs due to the larger average headcount period over period and additional costs for recruiting to support the growth of our mortgage banker and property sales broker teams in 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table presents a period-to-period comparison of our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nADJUSTED EBITDA - 2018 COMPARED TO 2017\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 234,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 245,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (10,803)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net warehouse interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Escrow earnings and other interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (273,344)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (268,143)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,201)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net write-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59,917)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,171)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,746)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 220,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 200,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See the table above for the components of the change in adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in origination fees was largely attributable to the change in the mix of loan origination volume year over year. Servicing fees increased principally due to an increase in the average servicing portfolio from 2017 to 2018 as a result of new loan originations, partially offset by a decrease in the average servicing fee. Net warehouse interest income decreased largely as a result of declines in the average balance and the net interest margin on loans held for sale due to a flattening yield curve. Escrow earnings and other interest income increased as a result of increases in the average escrow balance outstanding and the average earnings rate following the increases in short-term interest rates over the past year. Other revenues increased primarily due to an increase in investment management fees. The increase in personnel expense was primarily due to increased salaries and benefits due to a rise in headcount. Other operating expenses increased largely due to increased occupancy and travel costs due to the larger average headcount year over year and increased professional fees due to the JCR and iCap acquisitions.\nFinancial Condition\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operations are generated from loan sales, servicing fees, escrow earnings, net warehouse interest income, property sales broker fees, investment management fees, and other income, net of loan origination and operating costs. Our cash flows from operations are impacted by the fees generated by our loan originations and property sales, the timing of loan closings, assets under management, escrow account balances, the average balance of loans held for investment, and the period of time loans are held for sale in the warehouse loan facility prior to delivery to the investor.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities include the funding and repayment of loans held for investment and preferred equity investments, the contribution to and distribution from the Interim Program JV, the acquisition and disposition of equity-method investments, and the purchase of available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) securities pledged to Fannie Mae. We opportunistically invest cash for acquisitions and MSR portfolio purchases.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nWe use our warehouse loan facilities and, when necessary, our corporate cash to fund loan closings. We believe that our current warehouse loan facilities are adequate to meet our increasing loan origination needs. Historically, we have used a combination of long-term debt and cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions, repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, and fund a portion of loans held for investment.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table presents a period-to-period comparison of the significant components of cash flows for the

primarily the result of our investing and financing activities. Substantial decreases in purchases of pledged AFS securities, the size and number of acquisitions, and the decrease in the net investment in loans held for investment led to the decrease in the amount of cash used in investing activity shown above. Additionally, in 2018 we made significant cash outlays to repurchase common stock, along with substantial increases in net borrowings of note payable and secured borrowings.\nChanges in cash flows from operations were driven primarily by loans originated and sold. Such loans are held for short periods of time, generally less than 60 days, and impact cash flows presented as of a point in time. The increase in cash flows from operations year over year is primarily attributable to the net receipt of $0.3 billion for the funding of loan originations, net of sales of loans to third parties during 2019 compared to the net use of $0.1 billion during 2018. Excluding cash used for the origination and sale of loans, cash flows provided by operations was $166.6 million during 2019 compared to $166.1 million during 2018.\nThe increase in cash provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in the investment in loans held for investment and reductions in the net purchases of pledged AFS securities and cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in investments in joint ventures and a decrease in the proceeds from the payoff of preferred equity investments. The net investment in loans held for investment during 2019 was $43.1 million compared to net investment in loans held for investment of $436.6 million during 2018. A much larger percentage of the originations in 2019 was funded using borrowings than in 2018. For example, the origination activity in 2018 included a $150.0 million loan funded entirely using corporate cash with no comparable activity in 2019, and this loan was substantially repaid in 2019. The reduction in purchases of pledged AFS securities is due to most of our pledged cash and money market fund having been invested in previous periods. We began an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2017 to invest pledged collateral in AFS securities. During 2018, a larger balance of collateral was available to invest than 2019 as we made multiple purchases of these securities throughout 2018 and have not sold any investments and have had relatively few prepayments in 2019. The decrease in cash used for acquisitions is due to a year-over-year decrease in the size of the companies acquired. The increase in the cash invested in joint ventures was the result of net origination activity by the Interim Program JV and the startup of our appraisal JV. During 2019, the Interim Program JV had a larger level of net loan originations, resulting in a larger level of capital invested by us in the Interim Program JV.\nThe change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily attributable to the change in net warehouse borrowings period to period and decreases in the net borrowing of note payable and secured borrowings, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings of interim warehouse notes payable and a decrease in the repurchases of common stock. The change in net borrowings (repayments) of warehouse borrowings during 2019 was due to the change in the unpaid principal balance of LHFS funded by Agency Warehouse Facilities (as defined below) from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 and from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. During 2019, the unpaid principal balance of LHFS funded by Agency Warehouse Facilities decreased $261.0 million from their December 31, 2018 balance compared to an increase of $102.1 million during the same period in 2018.\nThe change in net borrowings of interim warehouse notes payable was principally due to interim loan origination and repayment activity period over period. During 2019, interim loans originated were funded principally from interim warehouse notes payable, and the interim loans that paid off were largely fully funded with corporate cash in prior years, resulting in net borrowings for interim warehouse loans in the current year. During 2018, the net repayments of interim warehouse notes payable was principally due to the Company's fully funding a large portfolio of loans held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2018. The secured borrowings in 2018 were the result of a unique transaction in 2018, with no comparable activity in 2019. The change in the net borrowings of note payable is related to the refinance of our term debt in 2018, with no comparable activity in 2019. The decrease in cash used for share repurchases is primarily related to a decrease in share repurchases under stock buyback programs year over year. The increase in cash dividends paid is the result of our increasing the dividends paid per share by 20% year over year. The decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock is principally related to a year-over-year decrease in the number of stock options exercised. Only 65 thousand shares were exercised during 2019 compared to 348 thousand in 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table presents a

of $166.3 million in the Total Cash balance from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 is primarily the result of our investing and financing activities. Substantial increases in purchases of pledged AFS securities, the size and number of acquisitions, and investments in loans held for investment led to the significant amount of cash used in investing activity shown above. Additionally, we made significant cash outlays to repurchase common stock and pay cash dividends. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were substantial increases in net borrowings of note payable and secured borrowings and a decrease in cash repayments of interim warehouse notes payable.\nChanges in cash flows from operations were driven primarily by loans acquired and sold. Such loans are held for short periods of time, generally less than 60 days, and impact cash flows presented as of a point in time. The decrease in cash flows from operations year over year is primarily attributable to the net use of $0.1 billion for the funding of loan originations, net of sales of loans to third parties during 2018 compared to the net receipt of $0.9 billion during 2017. Excluding cash used for the origination and sale of loans, cash flows provided by operations was $166.1 million during\n2018 compared to $148.2 million during 2017. The significant components of the change included a $48.4 million increase in deferred tax expense (a non-cash adjustment) due to Tax Reform and a $21.5 million lower adjustment to net income for gains attributable to the fair value of future servicing rights, partially offset by a $50.9 million decrease in net income before noncontrolling interests.\nThe reduction in cash provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily attributable to a change in the net payoff of (investment in) loans held for investment and an increase in the purchases of pledged AFS securities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the payoff of preferred equity investments. The net investment in loans held for investment during 2018 was $436.6 million compared to net payoff of loans held for investment of $155.4 million during 2017. Of the $436.6 million of the net investment in loans held for investment during 2018, $84.0 million was funded using interim warehouse borrowings (included in cash flows from financing activities), with the other $352.6 million funded using corporate cash. Of the $155.4 million of the net payoff of loans held for investment during 2017, $97.6 million was funded using interim warehouse borrowings, with the other $57.8 million funded using corporate cash. The increase in purchases of pledged AFS securities is due to a Company initiative to invest pledged collateral in AFS securities that began near the end of 2017. The decrease in cash paid for mortgage servicing rights was due to the substantially smaller size of the servicing portfolio purchased in 2018. The increase in cash used to fund preferred equity investments was principally due to a short-term preferred equity investment of $40.0 million in 2018, with no comparable transaction in 2017. The increase in the proceeds from the payoff of preferred equity investments was due to the repayment of the aforementioned $40.0 million short-term preferred equity investment and $41.8 million of preferred equity investments made over the past several years, as expected. Net cash paid for acquisitions increased due to an increase in the size and number of acquisitions year over year. The increase in the proceeds from the sale of equity-method investments was due to the sale of our small investment in a technology company, with no comparable activity in 2017.\nThe substantial change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily attributable to the changes in net warehouse borrowings and the change in the repayments of interim warehouse borrowings period to period and an increase in borrowings of note payable, partially offset by increases in repayments of note payable, repurchases of common stock, and cash dividends paid. The change in net borrowings (repayments) of warehouse borrowings in 2018 was due to a smaller increase in the unpaid principal balance of loans held for sale funded by Agency Warehouse Facilities (as defined below) from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 than from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. During 2018, the unpaid principal balance of loans held for sale funded by Agency Warehouse Facilities increased $102.1 million from their December 31, 2017 balance compared to a decrease of $919.5 million during the same period in 2017. Substantially all of the loans held for sale at the end of each period were funded with warehouse borrowings, with some loans held for sale funded with corporate cash.\nThe significant change in net repayments of interim warehouse notes payable was principally due to the Company's fully funding more loans in 2018 than in 2017. Most of this funding is expected to be short term. We typically fund a large portion of loans held for investment with interim warehouse borrowings. We refinanced our long-term debt during 2018, substantially increasing our long-term debt outstanding and leading to the increases in proceeds from note payable and repayment of note payable. The secured borrowings in 2018 were the result of a unique transaction in 2018, with no comparable activity in 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, we paid the first cash dividend in our history as a public company and have continued to pay cash dividends since. The increase in the repurchase of common stock was due to our using substantially all of the $50.0 million authorized repurchase capacity in 2018 compared to using much less of the repurchase capacity in 2017 under repurchase programs as more fully discussed below in the Uses of Liquidity, Cash and Cash Equivalents\u201d section.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUses of Liquidity, Cash and Cash Equivalents\nOur significant recurring cash flow requirements consist of (i) short-term liquidity necessary to fund loans held for sale; (ii) liquidity necessary to fund loans held for investment under the Interim Program; (iii) liquidity necessary to pay cash dividends; (iv) liquidity necessary to fund our portion of the equity necessary for the operations of the Interim Program JV and our appraisal JV; (v) working capital to support our day-to-day operations, including debt service payments and payments for salaries, commissions, and income taxes; and (vi) working capital to satisfy collateral requirements for our\nFannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations and to meet the operational liquidity requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, Ginnie Mae, and our warehouse facility lenders.\nFannie Mae has established benchmark standards for capital adequacy and reserves the right to terminate our servicing authority for all or some of the portfolio if at any time it determines that our financial condition is not adequate to support our obligations under the DUS agreement. We are required to maintain acceptable net worth as defined in the standards, and we satisfied the requirements as of December 31, 2019. The net worth requirement is derived primarily from unpaid balances on Fannie Mae loans and the level of risk-sharing. As of December 31, 2019, the net worth requirement was $194.6 million, and our net worth was $710.6 million, as measured at our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Walker & Dunlop, LLC. As of December 31, 2019, we were required to maintain at least $38.3 million of liquid assets to meet our operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, Ginnie Mae and our warehouse facility lenders. As of December 31, 2019, we had operational liquidity of $227.0 million, as measured at our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Walker & Dunlop, LLC.\nUnder certain limited circumstances, we may make preferred equity investments in entities controlled by certain of our borrowers that will assist those borrowers to acquire and reposition properties. The terms of such investments are negotiated with each investment. As of December 31, 2017, we had preferred equity investments with one borrower totaling $41.7 million, all of which were repaid during the year ended December 31, 2018. We made no preferred equity investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPrior to 2018, we retained all earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, did not pay cash dividends on our common stock. However, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share each quarter of 2018 and $0.30 per share each quarter of 2019. In February 2020, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.36 per share for the first quarter of 2020. The dividend will be paid March 9, 2020 to all holders of record of our restricted and unrestricted common stock as of February 21, 2020. We expect to continue to make regular quarterly dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\nOver the past three years, we have returned $148.2 million to investors in the form of the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs for a cost of $79.6 million and cash dividend payments of $68.6 million. Additionally, we have invested $177.2 million in acquisitions and the purchase of MSRs. On occasion, we may use cash to fully fund loans held for investment or loans held for sale instead of using our warehouse line. As of December 31, 2019, we used corporate cash to fully fund loans held for investment with an unpaid principal balance of $230.3 million and loans held for sale with an unpaid principal balance of $109.0 million. We continually seek opportunities to execute additional acquisitions and purchases of MSRs and complete such acquisitions if we believe the economics are favorable.\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that permitted the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock over a 12-month period beginning on February 9, 2018. In 2018, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for an aggregate cost of $57.0 million. In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permitted the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock over a 12-month period beginning on February 11, 2019. In 2019, we repurchased 0.1 million shares for an aggregate cost of $6.6 million. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that permits the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock over a 12-month period beginning on February 11, 2020.\nHistorically, our cash flows from operations and warehouse facilities have been sufficient to enable us to meet our short-term liquidity needs and other funding requirements. We believe that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient for us to meet our current obligations for the foreseeable future.\nRestricted Cash and Pledged Securities\nRestricted cash consists primarily of good faith deposits held on behalf of borrowers between the time we enter into a loan commitment with the borrower and the investor purchases the loan.\nWe are generally required to share the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program. We are required to secure this obligation by assigning collateral to Fannie Mae. We meet this obligation by\nassigning pledged securities to Fannie Mae. The amount of collateral required by Fannie Mae is a formulaic calculation at the loan level and considers the balance of the loan, the risk level of the loan, the age of the loan, and the level of risk-sharing. Fannie Mae requires collateral for Tier 2 loans of 75 basis points, which is funded over a 48-month period that begins upon delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. The restricted liquidity requirements for Tier 3 and Tier 4 loans is substantially less. Collateral held in the form of money market funds holding U.S. Treasuries is discounted 5%, and Agency MBS are discounted 4% for purposes of calculating compliance with the collateral requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we held substantially all of our restricted liquidity in Agency MBS in the aggregate amount of $114.6 million. Additionally, the majority of the loans for which we have risk sharing are Tier 2 loans. We fund any growth in our Fannie Mae required operational liquidity and collateral requirements from our working capital.\nWe are in compliance with the December 31, 2019 collateral requirements as outlined above. As of December 31, 2019, reserve requirements for the December 31, 2019 DUS loan portfolio will require us to fund $63.9 million in additional restricted liquidity over the next 48 months, assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within our at risk portfolio. Fannie Mae periodically reassesses the DUS Capital Standards and may make changes to these standards in the future. We generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to meet these capital standards and do not expect any future changes to have a material impact on our future operations; however, any future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact our available cash.\nUnder the provisions of the DUS agreement, we must also maintain a certain level of liquid assets referred to as the operational and unrestricted portions of the required reserves each year. We satisfied these requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nSources of Liquidity: Warehouse Facilities\nThe following table provides information related to our warehouse facilities as of December 31,

aggregate amount of $3.3 billion with certain national banks and a $1.5 billion uncommitted facility with Fannie Mae (collectively, the Agency Warehouse Facilities\u201d) that we use to fund substantially all of our loan originations. Six of these facilities are revolving commitments we expect to renew annually (consistent with industry practice), and the Fannie Mae facility is provided on an uncommitted basis\nwithout a specific maturity date. Our ability to originate mortgage loans depends upon our ability to secure and maintain these types of short-term financing on acceptable terms.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, an Agency Warehouse Facility with a $30.0 million aggregate committed and uncommitted borrowing capacity expired according to its terms. We believe that the six remaining committed and uncommitted credit facilities from national banks, the uncommitted credit facility from Fannie Mae, and our corporate cash provide us with sufficient borrowing capacity to conduct our Agency lending operations without this facility.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #1:\nWe have a warehousing credit and security agreement with a national bank for a $350.0 million committed warehouse line that is scheduled to mature on October 26, 2020. The agreement provides us with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and FHA loans. Advances are made at 100% of the loan balance and borrowings under this line bear interest at the 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 115 basis points. In addition to the committed borrowing capacity, the agreement provides $200.0 million of uncommitted borrowing capacity that bears interest at the same rate as the committed facility. The agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that are binding on the Company's operating subsidiary, Walker & Dunlop, LLC (which are in some cases subject to exceptions), including, but not limited to, restrictions on its ability to assume, guarantee, or become contingently liable for the obligation of another person, to undertake certain fundamental changes such as reorganizations, mergers, amendments to the Company's certificate of formation or operating agreement, liquidations, dissolutions or dispositions or acquisitions of assets or businesses, to cease to be directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company, to pay any subordinated debt in advance of its stated maturity or to take any action that would cause Walker & Dunlop, LLC to lose all or any part of its status as an eligible lender, seller, servicer or issuer or any license or approval required for it to engage in the business of originating, acquiring, or servicing mortgage loans.\nIn addition, the agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants, which are measured for the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as follows:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tangible net worth of the Company of not less than (i) $200.0 million plus (ii) 75% of the net proceeds of any equity issuances by the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the closing date; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>compliance with the applicable net worth and liquidity requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, and HUD; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>liquid assets of the Company of not less than $15.0 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintenance of aggregate unpaid principal amount of all mortgage loans comprising the Company's consolidated servicing portfolio of not less than $20.0 billion or (ii) all Fannie Mae DUS mortgage loans comprising the Company's consolidated servicing portfolio of not less than $10.0 billion, exclusive in both cases of mortgage loans which are 60 or more days past due or are otherwise in default or have been transferred to Fannie Mae for resolution; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>aggregate unpaid principal amount of Fannie Mae DUS mortgage loans within the Company's consolidated servicing portfolio which are 60 or more days past due or otherwise in default not to exceed 3.5% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all Fannie Mae DUS mortgage loans within the Company's consolidated servicing portfolio; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maximum indebtedness (excluding warehouse lines) to tangible net worth of 2.25 to 1.00. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe agreement contains customary events of default, which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds, notice requirements, and grace periods. During the third quarter of 2019, we executed the third amendment to the warehouse agreement that decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 120 basis points as of September 30, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we executed the fourth amendment to the warehouse and security agreement that extended the maturity date to October 26, 2020. Additionally, at our request, the committed amount was reduced to $350.0 million from $425.0 million. No other material modifications were made to the agreement in 2019.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #2:\nWe have a warehousing credit and security agreement with a national bank for a $500.0 million committed warehouse line that is scheduled to mature on September 8, 2020. The committed warehouse facility provides the Company with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and FHA loans. Advances are made at 100% of the loan balance, and borrowings under this line bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points. In addition to the committed borrowing capacity, the agreement provides $300.0 million of uncommitted borrowing capacity that bears interest at the same rate as the committed facility. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the fourth amendment to the warehouse and security agreement that extended the maturity date to September 8, 2020. No other material modifications were made to the agreement in 2019.\nThe negative and financial covenants of the amended and restated warehouse agreement conform to those of the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above, with the exception of the leverage ratio covenant, which is not included in the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #2.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #3:\nWe have a $500.0 million committed warehouse credit and security agreement with a national bank that is scheduled to mature on April 30, 2020. The committed warehouse facility provides the Company with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD and FHA loans. Advances are made at 100% of the loan balance, and the borrowings under the warehouse agreement bear interest at a rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points. In addition to the committed borrowing capacity, the agreement provides $265.0 million of uncommitted borrowing capacity that bears interest at the same rate at the committed facility. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the tenth amendment to the warehouse agreement that extended the maturity date to April 30, 2020 and decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 125 basis points. Additionally, the amendment provided for an uncommitted amount of $265.0 million until January 31, 2020. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe negative and financial covenants of the warehouse agreement conform to those of the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #4:\nWe have a $350.0 million committed warehouse credit and security agreement with a national bank that is scheduled to mature on October 4, 2020. The warehouse facility provides the Company with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, FHA, and defaulted HUD and FHA loans. Advances are made at 100% of the loan balance, and the borrowings under the warehouse agreement bear interest at a rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the sixth amendment to the warehouse agreement that decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 120 basis points. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we executed the Amended and Restated Mortgage Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended and Restated Agreement\u201d). The Amended and Restated Agreement has the same terms and conditions as the agreement it replaced except that it provides the Company with the ability to fund defaulted HUD and FHA loans up to $30.0 million and extends the maturity date to October 4, 2020. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe negative and financial covenants of the warehouse agreement conform to those of the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above, with the exception of the leverage ratio covenant, which is not included in the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #4.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #5:\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we executed a warehousing and security agreement with a national bank to establish Agency Warehouse Facility #5. The facility, which is structured as a master repurchase agreement, has an uncommitted $500.0 million maximum borrowing amount and is scheduled to mature on August 5, 2020. The committed warehouse facility provides us with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and FHA loans. Advances are made at 100% of the loan balance, and the borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe negative and financial covenants of the warehouse agreement conform to those of the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above.\nAgency Warehouse Facility #6\nWe had a $250.0 million committed warehouse credit and security agreement with a national bank that matured on January 31, 2020. The warehouse facility provided us with the ability to fund Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and FHA loans under the facility. Advances were made at 100% of the loan balance, and the borrowings under the warehouse agreement bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 115 basis points. The agreement provided $100.0 million of uncommitted borrowing capacity that bore interest at the same rate as the committed facility. During the first quarter of 2019, we executed the second amendment to the warehouse and security agreement that extended the maturity date to January 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we executed the third amendment to the warehouse and security agreement that decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 115 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 120 basis points. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019. We allowed the credit facility to expire on January 31, 2020 according to its terms. We believe our aggregate remaining credit facilities provide us with sufficient capacity to conduct our ongoing Agency business.\nThe negative and financial covenants of the warehouse agreement substantially conform to those of the warehouse agreement for Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above.\nUncommitted Agency Warehouse Facility:\nWe have a $1.5 billion uncommitted facility with Fannie Mae under its ASAP funding program. After approval of certain loan documents, Fannie Mae will fund loans after closing and the advances are used to repay the primary warehouse line. Fannie Mae will advance 99% of the loan balance. There is no expiration date for this facility. The uncommitted facility has no specific negative or financial covenants.\nInterim Warehouse Facilities\nTo assist in funding loans held for investment under the Interim Program, we have four warehouse facilities with certain national banks in the aggregate amount of $410.0 million as of December 31, 2019 ( Interim Warehouse Facilities\u201d). Consistent with industry practice, three of these facilities are revolving commitments we expect to renew annually, and one is a revolving commitment we expect to renew every two years. Our ability to originate loans held for investment depends upon our ability to secure and maintain these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms.\nInterim Warehouse Facility #1:\nWe have an $135.0 million committed warehouse line agreement that is scheduled to mature on April 30, 2020. The facility provides the Company with the ability to fund first mortgage loans on multifamily real estate properties for periods of up to three years, using available cash in combination with advances under the facility. Borrowings under the facility are full recourse to the Company and bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 190 basis points. Repayments under the credit agreement are interest-only, with principal repayments made upon the earlier of the refinancing of an underlying mortgage or the maturity of an advance under the credit agreement. During the first quarter of 2019, we executed the ninth amendment to the credit and security agreement that increased the maximum borrowing capacity to $135.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the tenth amendment to the credit and security agreement that extended the maturity date to April 30, 2020. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe facility agreement requires the Company's compliance with the same financial covenants as Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above, and also includes the following additional financial covenant:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>minimum rolling four-quarter EBITDA, as defined, to total debt service ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterim Warehouse Facility #2:\nWe have a $100.0 million committed warehouse line agreement that is scheduled to mature on December 13, 2021. The agreement provides the Company with the ability to fund first mortgage loans on multifamily real estate properties\nfor periods of up to three years, using available cash in combination with advances under the facility. Borrowings under the facility are full recourse to the Company. All borrowings originally bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 165 basis points. The lender retains a first priority security interest in all mortgages funded by such advances on a cross-collateralized basis. Repayments under the credit agreement are interest-only, with principal repayments made upon the earlier of the refinancing of an underlying mortgage or the maturity of an advance under the credit agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we executed the fifth amendment to the warehouse and security agreement that decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 165 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 200 basis points and extended the maturity date to December 13, 2021. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe credit agreement requires the borrower and the Company to abide by the same financial covenants as Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above, with the exception of the leverage ratio covenant, which is not included in the warehouse agreement for Interim Warehouse Facility #2. Additionally, Interim Warehouse Facility #2 has the following additional financial covenants:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>rolling four-quarter EBITDA, as defined, of not less than $35.0 million; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>debt service coverage ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.75 to 1.00. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterim Warehouse Facility #3:\nWe have a $75.0 million repurchase agreement with a national bank that is scheduled to mature on May 18, 2020. The agreement provides the Company with the ability to fund first mortgage loans on multifamily real estate properties for periods of up to three years, using available cash in combination with advances under the facility. Borrowings under the facility are full recourse to the Company. The borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 1.90% to 2.50% ( the spread\u201d). The spread varies according to the type of asset the borrowing finances. Repayments under the credit agreement are interest-only, with principal repayments made upon the earlier of the refinancing of an underlying mortgage or the maturity of an advance under the credit agreement. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the fourth amendment to the credit and security agreement that extended the maturity date to May 18, 2020 and provides for an uncommitted amount of $75.0 million. No other material modifications were made to the agreement during 2019.\nThe Repurchase Agreement requires the borrower and the Company to abide by the following financial covenants:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tangible net worth of the Company of not less than (i) $200.0 million plus (ii) 75% of the net proceeds of any equity issuances by the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the closing date; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>liquid assets of the Company of not less than $15.0 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>leverage ratio, as defined, of not more than 3.0 to 1.0; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>debt service coverage ratio, as defined, of not less than 2.75 to 1.00. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterim Warehouse Facility #4:\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we executed a warehousing credit and security agreement to establish an additional interim warehouse facility. The warehouse facility has a committed $100.0 million maximum borrowing amount and is scheduled to mature on April 30, 2020. We can fund certain interim loans to a specific large institutional borrower, and the borrowings under the warehouse agreement bear interest at a rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 175 basis points. During the second quarter of 2019, we executed the first amendment to the warehousing credit and security agreement that extended the maturity date to April 30, 2020. No other material modifications were made to the agreement in 2019.\nThe facility agreement requires the Company's compliance with the same financial covenants as Agency Warehouse Facility #1, described above, and also includes the following additional financial covenant:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>leverage ratio, as defined, of not more than 2.25 to 1.00. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe warehouse agreements above contain cross-default provisions, such that if a default occurs under any of our warehouse agreements, generally the lenders under our other warehouse agreements could also declare a default. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our warehouse line covenants.\nWe believe that the combination of our capital and warehouse facilities is adequate to meet our loan origination needs.\nDebt Obligations\nOn November 7, 2018, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) that amended and restated our prior credit agreement and provided for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan was issued at a 0.5% discount, has a stated maturity date of November 7, 2025, and bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 200 basis points. At any time, we may also elect to request one or more incremental term loan commitments not to exceed $150.0 million, provided that the total indebtedness would not cause the leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to exceed 2.00 to 1.00.\nWe are obligated to repay the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments equal to $0.8 million on the last business day of each of March, June, September, and December commencing on March 31, 2019. The term loan also requires certain other prepayments in certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Agreement. The final principal installment of the term loan is required to be paid in full on November 7, 2025 (or, if earlier, the date of acceleration of the term loan pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Agreement) and will be in an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal of the term loan on such date (together with all accrued interest thereon). During the fourth quarter of 2019, we executed the first amendment to the Term Loan that decreased the borrowing rate to 30-day LIBOR plus 200 basis points from 30-day LIBOR plus 225. No other material modifications were made to the agreement in 2019.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Walker & Dunlop Multifamily, Inc., Walker & Dunlop, LLC, Walker & Dunlop Capital, LLC, and W&D BE, Inc., each of which is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (together with the Company, the Loan Parties\u201d), pursuant to the Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement entered into on November 7, 2018 among the Loan Parties and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d). Subject to certain exceptions and qualifications contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to cause any newly created or acquired subsidiary, unless such subsidiary has been designated as an Excluded Subsidiary (as defined in the Credit Agreement) by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, to guarantee the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and become a party to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.

As of December 31, 2017, the entire balance consists of Interim Program JV managed loans. We indirectly share in a portion of the risk of loss associated with Interim Program JV managed loans through our 15% equity ownership in the Interim Program JV.

Use of the at risk portfolio provides for comparability of the full risk-sharing and modified risk-sharing loans because the provision and allowance for risk-sharing obligations are based on the at risk balances of the associated loans. Accordingly, we have presented the key statistics as a percentage of the at risk portfolio. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor example, a $15 million loan with 50% risk-sharing has the same potential risk exposure as a $7.5 million loan with full DUS risk sharing. Accordingly, if the $15 million loan with 50% risk-sharing were to default, we would view the overall loss as a percentage of the at risk balance, or $7.5 million, to ensure comparability between all risk-sharing obligations.

The risk-sharing tiers and amount of the risk-sharing obligations we absorb under full risk-sharing are provided below.

We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing obligation from the levels described above.\nWe use several techniques to manage our risk exposure under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing program. These techniques include maintaining a strong underwriting and approval process, evaluating and modifying our underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals, limiting our geographic market and borrower exposures, and electing the modified risk-sharing option under the Fannie Mae DUS program.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, Fannie Mae increased our risk-sharing cap from $60.0 million to $200.0 million. Accordingly, our maximum loss exposure on any one loan is $40.0 million (such exposure would occur if the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fairly compensated for the risks of the transaction.\nA provision for risk-sharing obligations is recorded, and the allowance for risk-sharing obligations is increased, when it is probable that we have incurred risk-sharing obligations. We regularly monitor the credit quality of all loans for which we have a risk-sharing obligation. Loans with indicators of underperforming credit are placed on a watch list, assigned a numerical risk rating based on our assessment of the relative credit weakness, and subjected to additional evaluation or loss mitigation. Indicators of underperforming credit include poor financial performance, poor physical condition, poor management, and delinquency.\nThe amount of the provision considers our assessment of the likelihood of payment by the borrower, the value of the underlying collateral, and the level of risk-sharing. Historically, the loss recognition occurs at or before the loan becoming 60 days delinquent. Our estimates of value are determined considering broker opinions and other sources of market value information relevant to underlying property and collateral. Risk-sharing obligations are written off against the allowance at final settlement with Fannie Mae.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, loans with an aggregate UPB of $48.5 million and $11.1 million of our at risk balances had defaulted, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our provisions for risk-sharing obligations were $6.4 million, $0.7 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our allowance for risk-sharing obligations was $11.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, or three basis points and one basis point of the at risk balance, respectively. The Allowance for risk-sharing obligations as of December 31, 2019 was based primarily on the specific reserves related to two large defaulted loans. As there were only two small defaulted loans in the at risk servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2018, the Allowance for risk-sharing obligations as of December 31, 2018 was based primarily on our collective assessment of the probability of loss related to the loans on the watch list as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the ten-year period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2019, we recognized net write-offs of risk-sharing obligations of $24.1 million, or an average of two basis points annually of the average at risk Fannie Mae portfolio balance.\nWe have never been required to repurchase a loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk\nOther than the risk-sharing obligations under the Fannie Mae DUS Program disclosed previously in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. We believe our recurring cash flows from operations and proceeds from loan sales and loan payoffs will provide sufficient cash flows to cover the scheduled payments over the near term related to our contractual obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nContractual payments due under warehouse facility obligations, long-term debt, and other obligations at December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year through 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 362,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 293,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse facilities (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 923,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 831,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,336,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 867,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 139,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 293,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Interest for long-term debt is based on a variable rate.

Although we do not believe any of the accounting pronouncements listed there will have a significant impact on our business activities or compliance with our debt covenants, we are still in the process of determining the impact some of the new pronouncements may have on our future financial results and operating activities.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") by the end of 2021. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs. Our borrowing agreements include provisions for alternative rates, in the event that LIBOR is not available. In addition to the impact of our borrowing, certain adjustable rate loans in our servicing portfolio and investment securities available for sale are indexed to LIBOR. If LIBOR is replaced by a new reference rate or ceases to exist, it may have an impact on our operations or the price volatility of our investment securities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the headings Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness\nWalker & Dunlop, Inc. is a holding company, and we conduct the majority of our operations through Walker & Dunlop, LLC, our operating company.\nWe are one of the leading commercial real estate services and finance companies in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending, debt brokerage, and property sales. We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products to owners and developers of commercial real estate across the country, provide multifamily property sales brokerage services in various regions throughout the United States, and engage in commercial real estate investment management activities.\nWe originate and sell multifamily loans through the programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and HUD, with which we have licenses and long-established relationships. We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on nearly all loans that we originate for the Agencies' programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer nationally for Conventional, Seniors Housing, and Targeted Affordable Housing, a HUD MAP lender nationally, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender nationally, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. We broker and service loans for several life insurance companies, CMBS issuers, commercial banks, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker.\nWe fund loans for the Agencies' programs, generally through warehouse facility financings, and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment, which we obtain at rate lock. Proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility. The sale of the loan is typically completed within 60 days after the loan is closed, and we retain the right to service substantially all of these loans. In cases where we do not fund the loan, we act as a loan broker and service some of the loans. Our mortgage bankers who focus on loan brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders to find the most appropriate loan. These loans are then funded directly by the institutional lender, and for those brokered loans we service, we collect ongoing servicing fees while those loans remain in our servicing portfolio. The servicing fees we typically earn on brokered loan transactions are substantially lower than the servicing fees we earn for servicing Agency loans.\nWe recognize revenue when we make simultaneous commitments to originate a loan to a borrower and sell that loan to an investor. The revenues earned reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees, premiums on the sale of loans, net of any co-broker fees, and the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with servicing the loans, net of any guaranty obligations retained. We also recognize revenue when we receive the origination fee from a brokered loan transaction. Other sources of revenue include (i) net warehouse interest income we earn while the loan is held for sale through one of our warehouse facilities, (ii) net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment while they are outstanding, (iii) sales commissions for brokering the sale of multifamily properties, and (iv) asset management fees from our investment management activities.\nWe retain servicing rights on substantially all the loans we originate and sell, and generate revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans, from the interest income on escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers, and from other ancillary fees. Servicing fees set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan and are based on the unpaid principal balance of the loan. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac servicing arrangements generally provide for prepayment fees to us in the event of a voluntary prepayment. For loans serviced outside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we typically do not share in any such payments.\nWe are currently not exposed to unhedged interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing, and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated concurrently with establishing the coupon rate for\nthe loan. We also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing. We have agreements in place with the Agencies that specify the cost of a failed loan delivery, in the event we fail to deliver the loan to the investor. To protect us against such fees, we require a deposit from the borrower at rate lock that is typically more than the potential fee. The deposit is returned to the borrower only once the loan is closed. Any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost. We are also protected contractually from an investor's failure to purchase the loan. We have experienced an immaterial number of failed deliveries in our history and have incurred immaterial losses on such failed deliveries.\nWe have risk-sharing obligations on substantially all loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. When a Fannie Mae DUS loan is subject to full risk-sharing, we absorb losses on the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the original unpaid principal balance of the loan (subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within 12 months of its sale to Fannie Mae), except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. We occasionally request modified risk-sharing based on the size of the loan. During the second quarter of 2018, Fannie Mae increased our risk-sharing cap from $60.0 million to $200.0 million. Accordingly, our maximum loss exposure on any one loan is $40.0 million (such exposure would occur if the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fairly compensated for the risks of the transaction. Our servicing fees for risk-sharing loans include compensation for the risk-sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we receive from Fannie Mae for loans with no risk-sharing obligations.\nOur Interim Program offers floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of generally up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing. We underwrite, asset-manage, and service all loans executed through the Interim Program. The ultimate goal of the Interim Program is to provide permanent Agency financing on these transition properties. The Interim Program has two distinct executions: held by the Interim Program JV and held for investment.\nThe Interim Program JV assumes full risk of loss while the loans it originates are outstanding. We hold a 15% ownership interest in the Interim Program JV and are responsible for sourcing, underwriting, servicing, and asset-managing the loans originated by the joint venture. The joint venture funds its operations using a combination of equity contributions from its owners and third-party credit facilities.\nWe originate and hold some Interim Program loans for investment, which are included on our balance sheet. During the time that these loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss. Since we began originating interim loans, we have not charged off any Interim Program loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had 22 loans held for investment under the Interim Program with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of $546.6 million. One loan, totaling $14.7 million, is currently in default, and we are working with the borrower to restructure the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $436.1 million of the $757.2 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture, with the remainder originated through our Interim Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $350.0 million of the $993.1 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we asset-managed $670.5 million and $334.6 million, respectively of interim loans on behalf of the Interim Program JV.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we transferred a $70.1 million portfolio of participating interests in loans held for investment to a third party and accounted for the transfer as a secured borrowing. The balance of the portfolio is presented as loans held for investment with an offsetting amount for the secured borrowing included as account payable as of December 31, 2019. We do not have credit risk related to the transferred loans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a $150.0 million participation in a subordinated note with a large institutional investor in multifamily loans and presented as loans held for investment. The participation was fully funded with corporate cash and has been paid down to $7.8 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019, the borrower repaid principal of $142.2 million, and the remaining $7.8 million was repaid in February2020.\nThrough WDIS, we offer property sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell these properties. Through these property sales brokerage services, we seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients using our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and relying on our experienced transaction professionals. Our property sales services are offered in various regions throughout the United States. We have added several property sales brokerage teams over the past few years and continue to seek to add other property sales brokers, with the goal of expanding these services to cover all major regions throughout the United States. We consolidate the activities of WDIS and present the portion of WDIS that we do not control as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Net income from noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company acquired JCR, the operator, registered investment adviser, and general partner of private commercial real estate investment funds focused on the management of debt, preferred equity, and mezzanine equity investments in private middle-market commercial real estate funds and separately managed accounts. The acquisition of JCR, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is part of our strategy to grow and diversify the company by growing our investment management platform. JCR's current assets under management ( AUM\u201d) of $1.2 billion primarily consist of assets held in three managed funds: Fund III, Fund IV, Fund V, and separate accounts managed for life insurance companies. AUM for Fund III and Fund IV consist of both unfunded commitments and funded investments, AUM for Fund V consists of unfunded commitments, and AUM for the separate accounts consist entirely of funded investments. Unfunded commitments are highest during the fund raising and investment phases. AUM disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from regulatory assets under management disclosed on JCR's Form ADV.\nJCR typically receives management fees based on limited partner capital commitments, unfunded investment commitments, and funded investments. Additionally, with respect to Fund III, Fund IV, and Fund V, JCR receives a percentage of the profits above the fund expenses and preferred return specified in the fund offering agreements.\nOver the past several years, we have purchased the rights to service HUD loans with an aggregate $4.3 billion unpaid principal balance from third-party servicers for a total of $52.7 million. The acquisition of these servicing rights substantially increased our HUD servicing portfolio and led to our being one of the largest servicers of HUD commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2019. We expect the servicing rights acquisitions to have the following benefits:\n \u25cf reduce the average cost to service each loan as we leverage our existing servicing platform, \n \u25cf provide new borrower relationships, \n \u25cf provide opportunities for additional loan origination volume when these loans mature or prepay, and \n \u25cf produce a stable stream of cash revenues over the estimated lives of the portfolios.  As of December 31, 2019, our servicing portfolio was $93.2 billion, up 9% from December 31, 2018, making it the 7th largest commercial/multifamily primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Mortgage Bankers' Association's ( MBA\u201d) 2019 year-end survey (the Survey\u201d). Our servicing portfolio includes $40.0 billion of loans serviced for Fannie Mae and $32.6 billion for Freddie Mac, making us the 2nd and 3rd largest primary cashier servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in the nation, respectively, according to the Survey. Also included in our servicing portfolio is $10.0 billion of HUD loans, the 2nd largest HUD primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Survey.\nThe average number of our mortgage bankers increased from 138 during 2018 to 150 during 2019 due to organic growth, contributing to an increase of 5% in our loan origination volume, from a total of $25.3 billion during 2018 to a total of $26.6 billion during 2019. Fannie Mae recently announced that we ranked as its largest DUS lender in 2019, by loan deliveries, and Freddie Mac recently announced that we ranked as its 3rd largest Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer in 2019, by loan deliveries. Additionally, we were the third largest multifamily lender for HUD in 2019 based on MAP initial endorsements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights ( MSRs\u201d). MSRs are recorded at fair value at loan sale or upon purchase. The fair value of MSRs acquired through a stand-alone servicing portfolio purchase ( PMSR\u201d) is equal to the purchase price paid. The fair value at loan sale ( OMSR\u201d) is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights and takes into consideration an estimate of loan prepayment. Initially, the fair value amount is included as a component of the derivative asset fair value at the loan commitment date. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the OMSR over the estimated life of the underlying loan. The discount rates used throughout the periods presented for all OMSRs were between 10-15% and varied based on the loan type. The life of the underlying loan is estimated giving consideration to the prepayment provisions in the loan. Our model for OMSRs assumes no prepayment while the prepayment provisions have not expired and full prepayment of the loan at or near the point where the prepayment provisions have expired. We record an individual OMSR asset (or liability) for each loan at loan sale. For PMSRs, we record and amortize a portfolio-level MSR asset based on the estimated remaining life of the portfolio using the prepayment characteristics of the portfolio. We have had three stand-alone servicing portfolio purchases, one each in 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of OMSRs are based on internal models and are periodically compared to assumptions used by other market participants. Due to the relatively few transactions in the multifamily MSR market, we have experienced little volatility in the assumptions we used during the periods presented, including the most-significant assumption - the discount rate. Additionally, we do not expect to see significant volatility in the assumptions for the foreseeable future. Management actively monitors the assumptions used and makes adjustments to those assumptions when market conditions change or other factors indicate such adjustments are warranted. We carry OMRSs and PMSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and evaluate the carrying value for impairment quarterly. We test for impairment on PMSRs separately from OMSRs. The PMSRs and OMSRs are tested for impairment at the portfolio level. We have never recorded an impairment of MSRs in our history. We engage a third party to assist in determining an estimated fair value of our existing and outstanding MSRs on at least a semi-annual basis.\nRevenue is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The commitment asset related to the loan origination is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and sale premiums, net of any co-broker fees, and the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, net of the estimated net future cash flows associated with any risk-sharing obligations (the servicing component of the commitment asset\u201d). Upon loan sale, we derecognize the servicing component of the commitment asset and recognize an OMSR. All OMSRs are amortized into expense using the interest method over the estimated life of the loan and presented as a component of Amortization and depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor OMSRs, the individual loan-level OMSR is written off through a charge to Amortization and depreciation when a loan prepays, defaults, or is probable of default. For PMSRs, a constant rate of prepayments and defaults is included in the determination of the portfolio's estimated life (and thus included as a component of the portfolio's amortization). Accordingly, prepayments and defaults of individual loans do not change the level of amortization expense recorded for the portfolio unless the pattern of actual prepayments and defaults varies significantly from the estimated pattern. When such a significant difference in the pattern of estimated and actual prepayments and defaults occurs, we prospectively adjust the estimated life of the portfolio (and thus future amortization) to approximate the actual pattern observed. We have not adjusted the estimated life of our PMSRs, as the actual prepayment experience has not differed materially from the expected prepayment experience. We do not anticipate an adjustment to the estimated life of the portfolios will be necessary in the near term due to the characteristics of the portfolios, especially the low weighted-average interest rates and the relatively long remaining periods of prepayment protection.\nAllowance for Risk-sharing Obligations. This reserve liability (referred to as allowance\u201d) for risk-sharing obligations relates to our at risk servicing portfolio and is presented as a separate liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of this allowance considers our assessment of the likelihood of repayment by the borrower or key principal(s), the risk characteristics of the loan, the loan's risk rating, historical loss experience, adverse situations affecting individual loans, the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral, and the level of risk sharing. Historically, initial loss recognition occurs at or before a loan becomes 60 days delinquent. We regularly monitor the allowance on all applicable loans and update loss estimates as current information is received. Provision (benefit) for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflects the income statement impact of changes to both the allowance for risk-sharing obligations and allowance for loan losses.\nWe perform a quarterly evaluation of all of our risk-sharing loans to determine whether a loss is probable. Our process for identifying which risk-sharing loans may be probable of loss consists of an assessment of several qualitative and quantitative factors including payment status, property financial performance, local real estate market conditions, loan-to-value ratio, debt-service-coverage ratio, and property condition. We record an allowance for risk-sharing obligations related to all risk-sharing loans on our watch list ( general reserves\u201d). Such loans are not probable of foreclosure but are probable of loss as the characteristics of these loans indicate that it is probable that these loans include some losses even though the loss cannot be attributed to a specific loan. For all other risk-sharing loans not on our watch list, we continue to carry a guaranty obligation. We calculate the general reserves based on a migration analysis of the loans on our historical watch lists, adjusted for qualitative factors that are based on the characteristics of the servicing portfolio and the current market conditions. We have not experienced volatility in the general reserves loss percentage and do not expect to experience significant volatility in the near term.\nWhen we place a risk-sharing loan on our watch list, we transfer the remaining unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation to the general reserves. If a risk-sharing loan is subsequently removed from our watch list due to improved financial performance, we transfer the unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation back to the guaranty obligation classification on the balance sheet and amortize the remaining unamortized balance evenly over the remaining estimated life. For each loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation, we record one of the following liabilities associated with that loan as discussed above: guaranty obligation, general reserve, or specific reserve. Although the liability type may change over the life of the loan, at any particular point in time, only one such liability is associated with a loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation.\nWhen we believe a loan is probable of foreclosure or when the loan is in foreclosure, we record an allowance for that loan (a specific reserve\u201d). The specific reserve is based on the estimate of the property fair value less selling and property preservation costs and considers the loss-sharing requirements detailed below in the Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations\u201d section. The estimate of property fair value at initial recognition of the allowance for risk-sharing obligations is based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value. The allowance for risk-sharing obligations for such loans is updated as any additional information is received until the loss is settled with Fannie Mae. The settlement with Fannie Mae is based on the actual sales price of the property and selling and property preservation costs and considers the Fannie Mae loss-sharing requirements. Loss settlement with Fannie Mae has historically concluded within 18 to 36 months after foreclosure. Historically, the initial specific reserves have not varied significantly from the final settlement. We are uncertain whether such a trend will continue in the future.\nOverview of Current Business Environment\nThe fundamentals of the commercial real estate market remain strong. For the last two years, multifamily debt financing activity has represented at least 80% of our total mortgage banking volumes and has been a meaningful driver of our operating performance. Multifamily occupancy rates and effective rents remain strong based upon robust rental market demand while delinquency rates remain at historic lows, all of which aid loan performance and debt financing volumes due to their importance to the cash flows of the underlying properties. Additionally, the headwinds facing single-family home ownership, including high valuations and limited supply, have led to home ownership levels at or near historic lows over the past few years. At the same time, new household formation continues to grow, unemployment levels remain at historic lows, and macroeconomic indicators are strong, all resulting in high demand for multifamily housing.\nThe Mortgage Bankers' Association ( MBA\u201d) recently reported that the amount of commercial and multifamily mortgage debt outstanding continued to grow in the third quarter of 2019, reaching $3.6 trillion, an increase of $75.7 billion (2.2%) from the second quarter of 2019. Multifamily mortgage debt outstanding rose by $40.6 billion to $1.5 trillion as of the end of the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.8% from the second quarter of 2019.\nSteady household formation and a dearth of supply of entry-level single-family homes have led to strong demand for rental housing and continued increasing rents for multifamily properties in most markets. The positive performance has boosted the value of many multifamily properties towards the high end of historical ranges. According to RealPage, a provider of commercial real estate data and analytics, rent growth continued to increase at an average annual pace of 3.0% during the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupancy rates fell slightly to 95.8%, from a near all-time high of 96.3% in the third quarter of 2019. We believe that the market demand for multifamily housing in the upcoming quarters will continue to absorb most of the capacity created by new construction and that vacancy rates will remain near historic lows, continuing to make multifamily properties an attractive investment option.\nIn addition to the healthy property fundamentals, for the last several years, the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage market has experienced historically low cost of borrowing, which has further encouraged capital investment into commercial real estate. As borrowers have sought to take advantage of the interest rate environment and strong property fundamentals, the number of investors and amount of capital available to lend have increased. All of these factors have benefited our total transaction volumes over the past several years. Competition for lending on commercial and multifamily real estate among commercial real estate services firms, banks, life insurance companies, and the GSEs remains fierce.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 and by 25 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2019 and changed the target rate to 1.50% - 1.75%. Prior to the rate decreases starting in the third quarter of 2019, the rate had increased 125 basis points over the previous two years. Long-term mortgage interest rates, which form the basis for most of our lending, have remained at relatively low levels throughout this period and have resulted in a flattened yield curve. There remains a significant amount of capital investing in U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily properties resulting from historically low global interest rates and the strong fundamentals of the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily market.\nWe expect to see continued strength in the multifamily financing market for the foreseeable future due to the underlying fundamentals of the multifamily market as the labor market remains strong, single-family home ownership remains unaffordable for many households, and new household formation fuels rental demand.\nWe are a market-leading originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA\u201d) establishes loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each year. In September 2019, FHFA revised Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's loan origination caps to $100.0 billion each for all multifamily business for the five-quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020. The new caps apply to all multifamily business with no exclusions.\nThe GSEs reported combined loan origination volume of approximately $148.5 billion in 2019 compared to $143.3 billion during 2018, an increase of 3.6%, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac volumes growing 7.5% and 0.4%, respectively. We expect the GSEs to maintain their historical market share in a multifamily origination market that is projected by the MBA on average to be $390 billion in 2020. We believe our market leadership positions us to be a significant lender with the GSEs for the foreseeable future. Our originations with the GSEs are some of our most profitable executions as they provide significant non-cash gains from MSRs that turn into significant cash revenue streams in the future. A decline in our GSE originations would negatively impact our financial results as our non-cash revenues would decrease disproportionately with loan origination volume and future servicing fee revenue would be constrained or decline.\nWe continue to significantly grow our debt brokerage platform through hiring and acquisitions to gain greater access to capital, deal flow, and borrower relationships. The apparent appetite for debt funding within the broader commercial real estate market, along with the significant additions of mortgage bankers over the past several years, has resulted in significant growth in our brokered debt financing volume with a 40% increase in brokered debt financing volume from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our outlook for our debt brokerage platform is positive as we expect\ncontinued growth in the commercial and multifamily financing markets in the near future, and we expect to continue adding debt brokers to our platform.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the U.S. government was shut down for approximately one month, during which time HUD processed no loan commitments. The shutdown negatively impacted the amount of loan originations at HUD, which contributed to a decrease of 15% of 2019 originations compared to 2018. HUD remains a strong source of capital for new construction loans and healthcare facilities. We expect that HUD will continue to be a meaningful supplier of capital to our borrowers. We continue to seek to add resources and scale to our HUD lending platform, particularly in the area of construction lending, seniors housing, and skilled nursing, where HUD remains an important provider of capital.\nMany of our borrowers continue to seek higher returns by identifying and acquiring the transitional properties that the Interim Program is designed to address. We entered into the Interim Program JV to both increase the overall capital available to transitional properties and dramatically expand our capacity to originate Interim Program loans. The demand for transitional lending has brought increased competition from lenders, specifically banks, mortgage real estate investment trusts, and life insurance companies. All are actively pursuing transitional properties by leveraging their low cost of capital and desire for short-term, floating-rate, high-yield commercial real estate investments. We originated $935.9 million of interim loans during 2019 compared to $1.2 billion during 2018.\nWe saw increased activity in our multifamily-focused property sales platform in 2019 compared to 2018 as the macroeconomic conditions in 2019 continued to make multifamily properties an attractive investment, and we added 20 new property sales brokers to our platform during the year. We expect to continue adding to our property sales team in the future as we continue our efforts to expand the platform more broadly across the United States and to increase the size of our property sales team to capture what we believe will be strong multifamily property sales activity over the coming years.\nFactors That May Impact Our Operating Results\nWe believe that our results are affected by a number of factors, including the items discussed below.\n \u25cf Performance of Multifamily and Other Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to long-term mortgage interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions and the continued existence of the GSEs. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during stronger economic environments, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes, and loan origination volumes. During weaker economic environments, multifamily and other commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations, as well as an increased level of servicer advances and losses from our Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations and our interim lending program. \n \u25cf The Level of Losses from Fannie Mae Risk-Sharing Obligations. Under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we share risk of loss on most loans we sell to Fannie Mae. In the majority of cases, we absorb the first 5% of any losses on the loan's unpaid principal balance at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the loan's unpaid principal balance on the origination date, except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. As a result, a rise in defaults could have a material adverse effect on us. \n \u25cf The Price of Loans in the Secondary Market. Our profitability is determined in part by the price we are paid for the loans we originate. A component of our origination related revenues is the premium we recognize on the sale of a loan. Stronger investor demand typically results in larger premiums while weaker demand results in little to no premium. \n \u25cf Market for Servicing Commercial Real Estate Loans. Servicing fee rates for new loans are set at the time we enter into a loan sale commitment based on origination fees, competition, prepayment rates, and any risk- \n sharing obligations we undertake. Changes in servicing fee rates impact the value of our MSRs and future servicing revenues, which could impact our profit margins and operating results immediately and over time. \n \u25cf The Percentage of Adjustable Rate Loans Originated and the Overall Loan Origination Mix. The adjustable rate mortgage loans ( ARMs\u201d) we originate typically have less stringent prepayment protection features than fixed rate mortgage loans ( FRMs\u201d), resulting in a shorter expected life for ARMs than FRMs. The shorter expected life for ARMs results in smaller MSRs recorded than for FRMs. Absent an increase in originations, an increase in the proportion of our loans originated that are ARMs could adversely impact the gains from mortgage banking activities we record. Additionally, the loan product mix we originate can significantly impact our overall earnings. For example, an increase in loan origination volume for our two highest-margin products, Fannie Mae and HUD loans, without a change in total loan origination volume would increase our overall profitability, while a decrease in the loan origination volume of these two products without a change in total loan origination volume would decrease our overall profitability, all else equal. \nRevenues\nLoan Origination and Debt Brokerage Fees, net. Revenue related to the loan origination fee is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell to an investor or when a loan that we broker closes with the institutional lender. The commitment asset related to the loan origination fee is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and any sale premiums, net of co-broker fees. Also included in revenues from loan origination activities are changes to the fair value of loan commitments, forward sale commitments, and loans held for sale that occur during their respective holding periods. Upon sale of the loans, no gains or losses are recognized as such loans are recorded at fair value during their holding periods.\nBrokered loans tend to have lower origination fees because they often require less time to execute, there is more competition for brokerage assignments, and because the borrower will also have to pay an origination fee to the institutional lender.\nPremiums received on the sale of a loan result when a loan is sold to an investor for more than its face value. There are various reasons investors may pay a premium when purchasing a loan. For example, the fixed rate on the loan may be higher than the rate of return required by an investor or the characteristics of a particular loan may be desirable to an investor. We do not receive premiums on brokered loans.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nFair Value of Expected Net Cash Flows from Servicing, net. Revenue related to expected net cash flows from servicing is recognized at the loan commitment date, similar to the loan origination fees, as described above. The derivative asset is recognized at fair value, which reflects the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, reduced by the estimated fair value of any guaranty obligations to be assumed. OMSRs and guaranty obligations are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, upon the sale of the loans.\nOMSRs are recorded at fair value upon loan sale. The fair value is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the MSR over the estimated life of the loan.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nServicing Fees. We service nearly all loans we originate and some loans we broker. We earn servicing fees for performing certain loan servicing functions such as processing loan, tax, and insurance payments and managing escrow balances. Servicing generally also includes asset management functions, such as monitoring the physical condition of the property, analyzing the financial condition and liquidity of the borrower, and performing loss mitigation activities as directed by the Agencies.\nOur servicing fees on loans we originate provide a stable revenue stream. They are based on contractual terms, are earned over the life of the loan, and are generally not subject to significant prepayment risk. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac servicing agreements provide for prepayment fees in the event of a voluntary prepayment. Accordingly, we currently do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk. Any prepayment fees received are included in Other revenues.\nHUD has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause. In addition to termination for cause, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee. Our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements for brokered loans at any time with or without cause, without paying a termination fee.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Sale. We earn net interest income on loans funded through borrowings from our warehouse facilities from the time the loan is closed until the loan is sold pursuant to the loan purchase agreement. Each borrowing on a warehouse line relates to a specific loan for which we have already secured a loan sale commitment with an investor. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for sale varies based on the period of time between the loan closing and the sale of the loan to the investor, the size of the average balance of the loans held for sale, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. Loans may remain in the warehouse facility for up to 60 days, but the average time in the warehouse facility is approximately 30 days. As a short-term cash management tool, we may also use excess corporate cash to fund Agency loans on our balance sheet rather than borrowing against a warehouse line. Loans that we broker for institutional investors and other investors are funded directly by them; therefore, there is no warehouse interest income or expense associated with brokered loan transactions. Additionally, the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our Agency warehouse lines is included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for sale.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Investment. Similar to loans held for sale, we earn net interest income on loans held for investment during the period they are outstanding. We earn interest income on the loan, which is funded partially by an investment of our cash and through one of our interim warehouse credit facilities. The loans originated for investment are typically interest-only, variable-rate loans with terms up to three years. The warehouse credit facilities are variable rate. The interest rate reset date is typically the same for the loans and the credit facility. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for investment varies based on the period of time the loans are outstanding, the size of the average balance of the loans held for investment, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. The net spread has historically not varied much. Additionally, the amortization of deferred fees and costs and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our interim warehouse lines are included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for investment. Net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment will decrease in the coming years if most, or all, of the loans originated through the Interim Program are held by the Interim Program JV.\nEscrow Earnings and Other Interest Income. We earn fee income on property-level escrow deposits in our servicing portfolio, generally based on a fixed or variable placement fee negotiated with the financial institutions that hold the escrow deposits. Escrow earnings reflect interest income net of interest paid to the borrower, if required, which generally equals a money market rate. Escrow earnings tend to increase as short-term interest rates increase as they did in 2017 and 2018 but tend to decline as short-term interest rates decrease as they did in the latter part of 2019. Also included with escrow earnings and other interest income are interest earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and interest income earned on our pledged securities. Interest income from pledged securities increased during 2019 as we sold investments in money market funds and invested those proceeds in higher-earning multifamily Agency mortgage-backed securities ( Agency MBS\u201d).\nOther revenues. Other revenues are comprised of fees for processing loan assumptions, prepayment fee income, application fees, property sales broker fees, income from equity-method investments, income from preferred equity investments, asset management fees, and other miscellaneous revenues related to our operations.\nCosts and Expenses\nPersonnel. Personnel expense includes the cost of employee compensation and benefits, which include fixed and discretionary amounts tied to company and individual performance, commissions, severance expense, signing and retention bonuses, and share-based compensation.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation is principally comprised of amortization of our MSRs, net of amortization of our guaranty obligations. The MSRs are amortized using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received. We amortize the guaranty obligations evenly over their expected lives. When the loan underlying an OMSR prepays, we write off the remaining unamortized balance, net of any related guaranty obligation, and record the write off to Amortization and depreciation. Similarly, when the loan underlying an OMSR defaults, we write the OMSR off to Amortization and depreciation. We depreciate property, plant, and equipment ratably over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization and depreciation also includes the amortization of intangible assets, principally related to the amortization of the mortgage pipeline and other intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions. We recognize amortization related to the mortgage pipeline intangible asset when a loan included in the mortgage pipeline intangible asset is rate locked or is no longer probable of rate locking. Also included in amortization and depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR. These intangible assets consisted primarily of asset management contracts, which had an estimated life at acquisition of five years. For the years presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR in 2018.\nProvision (Benefit) for Credit Losses. The provision (benefit) for credit losses consists of two components: the provision associated with our risk-sharing loans and the provision associated with our loans held for investment. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with risk-sharing loans is established at the loan level when the borrower has defaulted on the loan or is probable of defaulting on the loan or collectively for loans that are not probable of default but on a watch list. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with our loans held for investment is established collectively for loans that are not impaired and individually for loans that are impaired. Our estimates of property fair value are based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value.\nInterest Expense on Corporate Debt. Interest expense on corporate debt includes interest expense incurred and amortization of debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs related to our term loan facility.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include sub-servicing costs, facilities costs, travel and entertainment costs, marketing costs, professional fees, license fees, dues and subscriptions, corporate insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company is a C-corporation subject to both federal and state corporate tax. As of December 31, 2019, our estimated combined statutory federal and state tax rate was approximately 25.0% compared to approximately 25.1% as of December 31, 2018 and 38.2% as of December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal income tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. Except for the effects of Tax Reform, our combined statutory tax rate has historically not varied significantly as the only material difference in the calculation of the combined statutory tax rate from year to year is the apportionment of our taxable income amongst the various states where we are subject to taxation since we do not have foreign operations or significant permanent differences. For example, from the period since we went public in 2010 through 2017, our combined statutory tax rate varied by only 0.7%, with a low of 38.2% and a high of 38.9%. Absent additional significant legislative changes to statutory tax rates (particularly the federal tax rate), we expect minimal deviation from the 2019 combined statutory tax rate for future years. However, we do expect some variability in the effective tax rate going forward due to excess tax benefits recognized and limitations on the deductibility of certain book expenses as a result of Tax Reform, primarily related to executive compensation.\nExcess tax benefits recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reduced income tax expense by $4.6 million, $6.8 million, and $9.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the excess tax benefits from 2017 to 2018 related primarily to the aforementioned reduction in the combined statutory tax rate due to Tax Reform. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 largely reflects the limited deductibility of excess tax benefits related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Partially offsetting the increases in other revenue streams was a decrease in net warehouse interest income from loans held for sale due to a lower net interest spread on loans held for sale year over year.\nThe increase in total expenses was due primarily to increases in (i) personnel expense mostly due to increases in salaries expense resulting from a rise in average headcount year over year and commissions costs due to the increases in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net and property sales broker fees, (ii) amortization and depreciation costs due to an increase in the average balance of MSRs outstanding year over year, (iii) provision for credit losses due to three loan defaults in 2019 compared to none in 2018, and (iv) other operating expenses due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the average headcount and an increase in recruiting costs.\nRevenues\nThe following table provides additional information that helps explain changes in origination fees and mortgage servicing rights over the past three years:\n\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or contemplated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the headings Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness\nWalker & Dunlop, Inc. is a holding company, and we conduct the majority of our operations through Walker & Dunlop, LLC, our operating company.\nWe are one of the leading commercial real estate services and finance companies in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending, debt brokerage, and property sales. We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products to owners and developers of commercial real estate across the country, provide multifamily property sales brokerage services in various regions throughout the United States, and engage in commercial real estate investment management activities.\nWe originate and sell multifamily loans through the programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and HUD, with which we have licenses and long-established relationships. We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on nearly all loans that we originate for the Agencies' programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer nationally for Conventional, Seniors Housing, and Targeted Affordable Housing, a HUD MAP lender nationally, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender nationally, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. We broker and service loans for several life insurance companies, CMBS issuers, commercial banks, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker.\nWe fund loans for the Agencies' programs, generally through warehouse facility financings, and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment, which we obtain at rate lock. Proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility. The sale of the loan is typically completed within 60 days after the loan is closed, and we retain the right to service substantially all of these loans. In cases where we do not fund the loan, we act as a loan broker and service some of the loans. Our mortgage bankers who focus on loan brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders to find the most appropriate loan. These loans are then funded directly by the institutional lender, and for those brokered loans we service, we collect ongoing servicing fees while those loans remain in our servicing portfolio. The servicing fees we typically earn on brokered loan transactions are substantially lower than the servicing fees we earn for servicing Agency loans.\nWe recognize revenue when we make simultaneous commitments to originate a loan to a borrower and sell that loan to an investor. The revenues earned reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees, premiums on the sale of loans, net of any co-broker fees, and the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with servicing the loans, net of any guaranty obligations retained. We also recognize revenue when we receive the origination fee from a brokered loan transaction. Other sources of revenue include (i) net warehouse interest income we earn while the loan is held for sale through one of our warehouse facilities, (ii) net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment while they are outstanding, (iii) sales commissions for brokering the sale of multifamily properties, and (iv) asset management fees from our investment management activities.\nWe retain servicing rights on substantially all the loans we originate and sell, and generate revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans, from the interest income on escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers, and from other ancillary fees. Servicing fees set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan and are based on the unpaid principal balance of the loan. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac servicing arrangements generally provide for prepayment fees to us in the event of a voluntary prepayment. For loans serviced outside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we typically do not share in any such payments.\nWe are currently not exposed to unhedged interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing, and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated concurrently with establishing the coupon rate for\nthe loan. We also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing. We have agreements in place with the Agencies that specify the cost of a failed loan delivery, in the event we fail to deliver the loan to the investor. To protect us against such fees, we require a deposit from the borrower at rate lock that is typically more than the potential fee. The deposit is returned to the borrower only once the loan is closed. Any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost. We are also protected contractually from an investor's failure to purchase the loan. We have experienced an immaterial number of failed deliveries in our history and have incurred immaterial losses on such failed deliveries.\nWe have risk-sharing obligations on substantially all loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. When a Fannie Mae DUS loan is subject to full risk-sharing, we absorb losses on the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the original unpaid principal balance of the loan (subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within 12 months of its sale to Fannie Mae), except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. We occasionally request modified risk-sharing based on the size of the loan. During the second quarter of 2018, Fannie Mae increased our risk-sharing cap from $60.0 million to $200.0 million. Accordingly, our maximum loss exposure on any one loan is $40.0 million (such exposure would occur if the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fairly compensated for the risks of the transaction. Our servicing fees for risk-sharing loans include compensation for the risk-sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we receive from Fannie Mae for loans with no risk-sharing obligations.\nOur Interim Program offers floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of generally up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing. We underwrite, asset-manage, and service all loans executed through the Interim Program. The ultimate goal of the Interim Program is to provide permanent Agency financing on these transition properties. The Interim Program has two distinct executions: held by the Interim Program JV and held for investment.\nThe Interim Program JV assumes full risk of loss while the loans it originates are outstanding. We hold a 15% ownership interest in the Interim Program JV and are responsible for sourcing, underwriting, servicing, and asset-managing the loans originated by the joint venture. The joint venture funds its operations using a combination of equity contributions from its owners and third-party credit facilities.\nWe originate and hold some Interim Program loans for investment, which are included on our balance sheet. During the time that these loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss. Since we began originating interim loans, we have not charged off any Interim Program loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had 22 loans held for investment under the Interim Program with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of $546.6 million. One loan, totaling $14.7 million, is currently in default, and we are working with the borrower to restructure the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $436.1 million of the $757.2 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture, with the remainder originated through our Interim Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $350.0 million of the $993.1 million of interim loan originations were executed through the joint venture. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we asset-managed $670.5 million and $334.6 million, respectively of interim loans on behalf of the Interim Program JV.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we transferred a $70.1 million portfolio of participating interests in loans held for investment to a third party and accounted for the transfer as a secured borrowing. The balance of the portfolio is presented as loans held for investment with an offsetting amount for the secured borrowing included as account payable as of December 31, 2019. We do not have credit risk related to the transferred loans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a $150.0 million participation in a subordinated note with a large institutional investor in multifamily loans and presented as loans held for investment. The participation was fully funded with corporate cash and has been paid down to $7.8 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019, the borrower repaid principal of $142.2 million, and the remaining $7.8 million was repaid in February2020.\nThrough WDIS, we offer property sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell these properties. Through these property sales brokerage services, we seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients using our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and relying on our experienced transaction professionals. Our property sales services are offered in various regions throughout the United States. We have added several property sales brokerage teams over the past few years and continue to seek to add other property sales brokers, with the goal of expanding these services to cover all major regions throughout the United States. We consolidate the activities of WDIS and present the portion of WDIS that we do not control as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Net income from noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company acquired JCR, the operator, registered investment adviser, and general partner of private commercial real estate investment funds focused on the management of debt, preferred equity, and mezzanine equity investments in private middle-market commercial real estate funds and separately managed accounts. The acquisition of JCR, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is part of our strategy to grow and diversify the company by growing our investment management platform. JCR's current assets under management ( AUM\u201d) of $1.2 billion primarily consist of assets held in three managed funds: Fund III, Fund IV, Fund V, and separate accounts managed for life insurance companies. AUM for Fund III and Fund IV consist of both unfunded commitments and funded investments, AUM for Fund V consists of unfunded commitments, and AUM for the separate accounts consist entirely of funded investments. Unfunded commitments are highest during the fund raising and investment phases. AUM disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from regulatory assets under management disclosed on JCR's Form ADV.\nJCR typically receives management fees based on limited partner capital commitments, unfunded investment commitments, and funded investments. Additionally, with respect to Fund III, Fund IV, and Fund V, JCR receives a percentage of the profits above the fund expenses and preferred return specified in the fund offering agreements.\nOver the past several years, we have purchased the rights to service HUD loans with an aggregate $4.3 billion unpaid principal balance from third-party servicers for a total of $52.7 million. The acquisition of these servicing rights substantially increased our HUD servicing portfolio and led to our being one of the largest servicers of HUD commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2019. We expect the servicing rights acquisitions to have the following benefits:\n \u25cf reduce the average cost to service each loan as we leverage our existing servicing platform, \n \u25cf provide new borrower relationships, \n \u25cf provide opportunities for additional loan origination volume when these loans mature or prepay, and \n \u25cf produce a stable stream of cash revenues over the estimated lives of the portfolios.  As of December 31, 2019, our servicing portfolio was $93.2 billion, up 9% from December 31, 2018, making it the 7th largest commercial/multifamily primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Mortgage Bankers' Association's ( MBA\u201d) 2019 year-end survey (the Survey\u201d). Our servicing portfolio includes $40.0 billion of loans serviced for Fannie Mae and $32.6 billion for Freddie Mac, making us the 2nd and 3rd largest primary cashier servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in the nation, respectively, according to the Survey. Also included in our servicing portfolio is $10.0 billion of HUD loans, the 2nd largest HUD primary and master servicing portfolio in the nation according to the Survey.\nThe average number of our mortgage bankers increased from 138 during 2018 to 150 during 2019 due to organic growth, contributing to an increase of 5% in our loan origination volume, from a total of $25.3 billion during 2018 to a total of $26.6 billion during 2019. Fannie Mae recently announced that we ranked as its largest DUS lender in 2019, by loan deliveries, and Freddie Mac recently announced that we ranked as its 3rd largest Freddie Mac Optigo Seller/Servicer in 2019, by loan deliveries. Additionally, we were the third largest multifamily lender for HUD in 2019 based on MAP initial endorsements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights ( MSRs\u201d). MSRs are recorded at fair value at loan sale or upon purchase. The fair value of MSRs acquired through a stand-alone servicing portfolio purchase ( PMSR\u201d) is equal to the purchase price paid. The fair value at loan sale ( OMSR\u201d) is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights and takes into consideration an estimate of loan prepayment. Initially, the fair value amount is included as a component of the derivative asset fair value at the loan commitment date. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the OMSR over the estimated life of the underlying loan. The discount rates used throughout the periods presented for all OMSRs were between 10-15% and varied based on the loan type. The life of the underlying loan is estimated giving consideration to the prepayment provisions in the loan. Our model for OMSRs assumes no prepayment while the prepayment provisions have not expired and full prepayment of the loan at or near the point where the prepayment provisions have expired. We record an individual OMSR asset (or liability) for each loan at loan sale. For PMSRs, we record and amortize a portfolio-level MSR asset based on the estimated remaining life of the portfolio using the prepayment characteristics of the portfolio. We have had three stand-alone servicing portfolio purchases, one each in 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of OMSRs are based on internal models and are periodically compared to assumptions used by other market participants. Due to the relatively few transactions in the multifamily MSR market, we have experienced little volatility in the assumptions we used during the periods presented, including the most-significant assumption - the discount rate. Additionally, we do not expect to see significant volatility in the assumptions for the foreseeable future. Management actively monitors the assumptions used and makes adjustments to those assumptions when market conditions change or other factors indicate such adjustments are warranted. We carry OMRSs and PMSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and evaluate the carrying value for impairment quarterly. We test for impairment on PMSRs separately from OMSRs. The PMSRs and OMSRs are tested for impairment at the portfolio level. We have never recorded an impairment of MSRs in our history. We engage a third party to assist in determining an estimated fair value of our existing and outstanding MSRs on at least a semi-annual basis.\nRevenue is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The commitment asset related to the loan origination is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and sale premiums, net of any co-broker fees, and the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, net of the estimated net future cash flows associated with any risk-sharing obligations (the servicing component of the commitment asset\u201d). Upon loan sale, we derecognize the servicing component of the commitment asset and recognize an OMSR. All OMSRs are amortized into expense using the interest method over the estimated life of the loan and presented as a component of Amortization and depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor OMSRs, the individual loan-level OMSR is written off through a charge to Amortization and depreciation when a loan prepays, defaults, or is probable of default. For PMSRs, a constant rate of prepayments and defaults is included in the determination of the portfolio's estimated life (and thus included as a component of the portfolio's amortization). Accordingly, prepayments and defaults of individual loans do not change the level of amortization expense recorded for the portfolio unless the pattern of actual prepayments and defaults varies significantly from the estimated pattern. When such a significant difference in the pattern of estimated and actual prepayments and defaults occurs, we prospectively adjust the estimated life of the portfolio (and thus future amortization) to approximate the actual pattern observed. We have not adjusted the estimated life of our PMSRs, as the actual prepayment experience has not differed materially from the expected prepayment experience. We do not anticipate an adjustment to the estimated life of the portfolios will be necessary in the near term due to the characteristics of the portfolios, especially the low weighted-average interest rates and the relatively long remaining periods of prepayment protection.\nAllowance for Risk-sharing Obligations. This reserve liability (referred to as allowance\u201d) for risk-sharing obligations relates to our at risk servicing portfolio and is presented as a separate liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of this allowance considers our assessment of the likelihood of repayment by the borrower or key principal(s), the risk characteristics of the loan, the loan's risk rating, historical loss experience, adverse situations affecting individual loans, the estimated disposition value of the underlying collateral, and the level of risk sharing. Historically, initial loss recognition occurs at or before a loan becomes 60 days delinquent. We regularly monitor the allowance on all applicable loans and update loss estimates as current information is received. Provision (benefit) for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflects the income statement impact of changes to both the allowance for risk-sharing obligations and allowance for loan losses.\nWe perform a quarterly evaluation of all of our risk-sharing loans to determine whether a loss is probable. Our process for identifying which risk-sharing loans may be probable of loss consists of an assessment of several qualitative and quantitative factors including payment status, property financial performance, local real estate market conditions, loan-to-value ratio, debt-service-coverage ratio, and property condition. We record an allowance for risk-sharing obligations related to all risk-sharing loans on our watch list ( general reserves\u201d). Such loans are not probable of foreclosure but are probable of loss as the characteristics of these loans indicate that it is probable that these loans include some losses even though the loss cannot be attributed to a specific loan. For all other risk-sharing loans not on our watch list, we continue to carry a guaranty obligation. We calculate the general reserves based on a migration analysis of the loans on our historical watch lists, adjusted for qualitative factors that are based on the characteristics of the servicing portfolio and the current market conditions. We have not experienced volatility in the general reserves loss percentage and do not expect to experience significant volatility in the near term.\nWhen we place a risk-sharing loan on our watch list, we transfer the remaining unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation to the general reserves. If a risk-sharing loan is subsequently removed from our watch list due to improved financial performance, we transfer the unamortized balance of the guaranty obligation back to the guaranty obligation classification on the balance sheet and amortize the remaining unamortized balance evenly over the remaining estimated life. For each loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation, we record one of the following liabilities associated with that loan as discussed above: guaranty obligation, general reserve, or specific reserve. Although the liability type may change over the life of the loan, at any particular point in time, only one such liability is associated with a loan for which we have a risk-sharing obligation.\nWhen we believe a loan is probable of foreclosure or when the loan is in foreclosure, we record an allowance for that loan (a specific reserve\u201d). The specific reserve is based on the estimate of the property fair value less selling and property preservation costs and considers the loss-sharing requirements detailed below in the Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations\u201d section. The estimate of property fair value at initial recognition of the allowance for risk-sharing obligations is based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value. The allowance for risk-sharing obligations for such loans is updated as any additional information is received until the loss is settled with Fannie Mae. The settlement with Fannie Mae is based on the actual sales price of the property and selling and property preservation costs and considers the Fannie Mae loss-sharing requirements. Loss settlement with Fannie Mae has historically concluded within 18 to 36 months after foreclosure. Historically, the initial specific reserves have not varied significantly from the final settlement. We are uncertain whether such a trend will continue in the future.\nOverview of Current Business Environment\nThe fundamentals of the commercial real estate market remain strong. For the last two years, multifamily debt financing activity has represented at least 80% of our total mortgage banking volumes and has been a meaningful driver of our operating performance. Multifamily occupancy rates and effective rents remain strong based upon robust rental market demand while delinquency rates remain at historic lows, all of which aid loan performance and debt financing volumes due to their importance to the cash flows of the underlying properties. Additionally, the headwinds facing single-family home ownership, including high valuations and limited supply, have led to home ownership levels at or near historic lows over the past few years. At the same time, new household formation continues to grow, unemployment levels remain at historic lows, and macroeconomic indicators are strong, all resulting in high demand for multifamily housing.\nThe Mortgage Bankers' Association ( MBA\u201d) recently reported that the amount of commercial and multifamily mortgage debt outstanding continued to grow in the third quarter of 2019, reaching $3.6 trillion, an increase of $75.7 billion (2.2%) from the second quarter of 2019. Multifamily mortgage debt outstanding rose by $40.6 billion to $1.5 trillion as of the end of the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.8% from the second quarter of 2019.\nSteady household formation and a dearth of supply of entry-level single-family homes have led to strong demand for rental housing and continued increasing rents for multifamily properties in most markets. The positive performance has boosted the value of many multifamily properties towards the high end of historical ranges. According to RealPage, a provider of commercial real estate data and analytics, rent growth continued to increase at an average annual pace of 3.0% during the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupancy rates fell slightly to 95.8%, from a near all-time high of 96.3% in the third quarter of 2019. We believe that the market demand for multifamily housing in the upcoming quarters will continue to absorb most of the capacity created by new construction and that vacancy rates will remain near historic lows, continuing to make multifamily properties an attractive investment option.\nIn addition to the healthy property fundamentals, for the last several years, the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage market has experienced historically low cost of borrowing, which has further encouraged capital investment into commercial real estate. As borrowers have sought to take advantage of the interest rate environment and strong property fundamentals, the number of investors and amount of capital available to lend have increased. All of these factors have benefited our total transaction volumes over the past several years. Competition for lending on commercial and multifamily real estate among commercial real estate services firms, banks, life insurance companies, and the GSEs remains fierce.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 50 basis points during the third quarter of 2019 and by 25 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2019 and changed the target rate to 1.50% - 1.75%. Prior to the rate decreases starting in the third quarter of 2019, the rate had increased 125 basis points over the previous two years. Long-term mortgage interest rates, which form the basis for most of our lending, have remained at relatively low levels throughout this period and have resulted in a flattened yield curve. There remains a significant amount of capital investing in U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily properties resulting from historically low global interest rates and the strong fundamentals of the U.S. commercial real estate and multifamily market.\nWe expect to see continued strength in the multifamily financing market for the foreseeable future due to the underlying fundamentals of the multifamily market as the labor market remains strong, single-family home ownership remains unaffordable for many households, and new household formation fuels rental demand.\nWe are a market-leading originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA\u201d) establishes loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each year. In September 2019, FHFA revised Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's loan origination caps to $100.0 billion each for all multifamily business for the five-quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020. The new caps apply to all multifamily business with no exclusions.\nThe GSEs reported combined loan origination volume of approximately $148.5 billion in 2019 compared to $143.3 billion during 2018, an increase of 3.6%, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac volumes growing 7.5% and 0.4%, respectively. We expect the GSEs to maintain their historical market share in a multifamily origination market that is projected by the MBA on average to be $390 billion in 2020. We believe our market leadership positions us to be a significant lender with the GSEs for the foreseeable future. Our originations with the GSEs are some of our most profitable executions as they provide significant non-cash gains from MSRs that turn into significant cash revenue streams in the future. A decline in our GSE originations would negatively impact our financial results as our non-cash revenues would decrease disproportionately with loan origination volume and future servicing fee revenue would be constrained or decline.\nWe continue to significantly grow our debt brokerage platform through hiring and acquisitions to gain greater access to capital, deal flow, and borrower relationships. The apparent appetite for debt funding within the broader commercial real estate market, along with the significant additions of mortgage bankers over the past several years, has resulted in significant growth in our brokered debt financing volume with a 40% increase in brokered debt financing volume from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our outlook for our debt brokerage platform is positive as we expect\ncontinued growth in the commercial and multifamily financing markets in the near future, and we expect to continue adding debt brokers to our platform.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the U.S. government was shut down for approximately one month, during which time HUD processed no loan commitments. The shutdown negatively impacted the amount of loan originations at HUD, which contributed to a decrease of 15% of 2019 originations compared to 2018. HUD remains a strong source of capital for new construction loans and healthcare facilities. We expect that HUD will continue to be a meaningful supplier of capital to our borrowers. We continue to seek to add resources and scale to our HUD lending platform, particularly in the area of construction lending, seniors housing, and skilled nursing, where HUD remains an important provider of capital.\nMany of our borrowers continue to seek higher returns by identifying and acquiring the transitional properties that the Interim Program is designed to address. We entered into the Interim Program JV to both increase the overall capital available to transitional properties and dramatically expand our capacity to originate Interim Program loans. The demand for transitional lending has brought increased competition from lenders, specifically banks, mortgage real estate investment trusts, and life insurance companies. All are actively pursuing transitional properties by leveraging their low cost of capital and desire for short-term, floating-rate, high-yield commercial real estate investments. We originated $935.9 million of interim loans during 2019 compared to $1.2 billion during 2018.\nWe saw increased activity in our multifamily-focused property sales platform in 2019 compared to 2018 as the macroeconomic conditions in 2019 continued to make multifamily properties an attractive investment, and we added 20 new property sales brokers to our platform during the year. We expect to continue adding to our property sales team in the future as we continue our efforts to expand the platform more broadly across the United States and to increase the size of our property sales team to capture what we believe will be strong multifamily property sales activity over the coming years.\nFactors That May Impact Our Operating Results\nWe believe that our results are affected by a number of factors, including the items discussed below.\n \u25cf Performance of Multifamily and Other Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to long-term mortgage interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions and the continued existence of the GSEs. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during stronger economic environments, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes, and loan origination volumes. During weaker economic environments, multifamily and other commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations, as well as an increased level of servicer advances and losses from our Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations and our interim lending program. \n \u25cf The Level of Losses from Fannie Mae Risk-Sharing Obligations. Under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we share risk of loss on most loans we sell to Fannie Mae. In the majority of cases, we absorb the first 5% of any losses on the loan's unpaid principal balance at the time of loss settlement, and above 5% we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the loan's unpaid principal balance on the origination date, except for rare instances when we negotiate a cap at 30% for loans with unique attributes. At December 31, 2019, we have had only one such experience. As a result, a rise in defaults could have a material adverse effect on us. \n \u25cf The Price of Loans in the Secondary Market. Our profitability is determined in part by the price we are paid for the loans we originate. A component of our origination related revenues is the premium we recognize on the sale of a loan. Stronger investor demand typically results in larger premiums while weaker demand results in little to no premium. \n \u25cf Market for Servicing Commercial Real Estate Loans. Servicing fee rates for new loans are set at the time we enter into a loan sale commitment based on origination fees, competition, prepayment rates, and any risk- \n sharing obligations we undertake. Changes in servicing fee rates impact the value of our MSRs and future servicing revenues, which could impact our profit margins and operating results immediately and over time. \n \u25cf The Percentage of Adjustable Rate Loans Originated and the Overall Loan Origination Mix. The adjustable rate mortgage loans ( ARMs\u201d) we originate typically have less stringent prepayment protection features than fixed rate mortgage loans ( FRMs\u201d), resulting in a shorter expected life for ARMs than FRMs. The shorter expected life for ARMs results in smaller MSRs recorded than for FRMs. Absent an increase in originations, an increase in the proportion of our loans originated that are ARMs could adversely impact the gains from mortgage banking activities we record. Additionally, the loan product mix we originate can significantly impact our overall earnings. For example, an increase in loan origination volume for our two highest-margin products, Fannie Mae and HUD loans, without a change in total loan origination volume would increase our overall profitability, while a decrease in the loan origination volume of these two products without a change in total loan origination volume would decrease our overall profitability, all else equal. \nRevenues\nLoan Origination and Debt Brokerage Fees, net. Revenue related to the loan origination fee is recognized when we record a derivative asset upon the simultaneous commitments to originate a loan with a borrower and sell to an investor or when a loan that we broker closes with the institutional lender. The commitment asset related to the loan origination fee is recognized at fair value, which reflects the fair value of the contractual loan origination related fees and any sale premiums, net of co-broker fees. Also included in revenues from loan origination activities are changes to the fair value of loan commitments, forward sale commitments, and loans held for sale that occur during their respective holding periods. Upon sale of the loans, no gains or losses are recognized as such loans are recorded at fair value during their holding periods.\nBrokered loans tend to have lower origination fees because they often require less time to execute, there is more competition for brokerage assignments, and because the borrower will also have to pay an origination fee to the institutional lender.\nPremiums received on the sale of a loan result when a loan is sold to an investor for more than its face value. There are various reasons investors may pay a premium when purchasing a loan. For example, the fixed rate on the loan may be higher than the rate of return required by an investor or the characteristics of a particular loan may be desirable to an investor. We do not receive premiums on brokered loans.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nFair Value of Expected Net Cash Flows from Servicing, net. Revenue related to expected net cash flows from servicing is recognized at the loan commitment date, similar to the loan origination fees, as described above. The derivative asset is recognized at fair value, which reflects the estimated fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with the servicing of the loan, reduced by the estimated fair value of any guaranty obligations to be assumed. OMSRs and guaranty obligations are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, upon the sale of the loans.\nOMSRs are recorded at fair value upon loan sale. The fair value is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights. The estimated net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the MSR over the estimated life of the loan.\nThe Critical Accounting Policies\u201d section above provides additional details of the accounting for these revenues.\nServicing Fees. We service nearly all loans we originate and some loans we broker. We earn servicing fees for performing certain loan servicing functions such as processing loan, tax, and insurance payments and managing escrow balances. Servicing generally also includes asset management functions, such as monitoring the physical condition of the property, analyzing the financial condition and liquidity of the borrower, and performing loss mitigation activities as directed by the Agencies.\nOur servicing fees on loans we originate provide a stable revenue stream. They are based on contractual terms, are earned over the life of the loan, and are generally not subject to significant prepayment risk. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac servicing agreements provide for prepayment fees in the event of a voluntary prepayment. Accordingly, we currently do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk. Any prepayment fees received are included in Other revenues.\nHUD has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause. In addition to termination for cause, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee. Our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements for brokered loans at any time with or without cause, without paying a termination fee.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Sale. We earn net interest income on loans funded through borrowings from our warehouse facilities from the time the loan is closed until the loan is sold pursuant to the loan purchase agreement. Each borrowing on a warehouse line relates to a specific loan for which we have already secured a loan sale commitment with an investor. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for sale varies based on the period of time between the loan closing and the sale of the loan to the investor, the size of the average balance of the loans held for sale, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. Loans may remain in the warehouse facility for up to 60 days, but the average time in the warehouse facility is approximately 30 days. As a short-term cash management tool, we may also use excess corporate cash to fund Agency loans on our balance sheet rather than borrowing against a warehouse line. Loans that we broker for institutional investors and other investors are funded directly by them; therefore, there is no warehouse interest income or expense associated with brokered loan transactions. Additionally, the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our Agency warehouse lines is included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for sale.\nNet Warehouse Interest Income, Loans Held for Investment. Similar to loans held for sale, we earn net interest income on loans held for investment during the period they are outstanding. We earn interest income on the loan, which is funded partially by an investment of our cash and through one of our interim warehouse credit facilities. The loans originated for investment are typically interest-only, variable-rate loans with terms up to three years. The warehouse credit facilities are variable rate. The interest rate reset date is typically the same for the loans and the credit facility. Related interest expense from the warehouse loan funding is netted in our financial statements against interest income. Net warehouse interest income related to loans held for investment varies based on the period of time the loans are outstanding, the size of the average balance of the loans held for investment, and the net interest spread between the loan coupon rate and the cost of warehouse financing. The net spread has historically not varied much. Additionally, the amortization of deferred fees and costs and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our interim warehouse lines are included in net warehouse interest income, loans held for investment. Net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment will decrease in the coming years if most, or all, of the loans originated through the Interim Program are held by the Interim Program JV.\nEscrow Earnings and Other Interest Income. We earn fee income on property-level escrow deposits in our servicing portfolio, generally based on a fixed or variable placement fee negotiated with the financial institutions that hold the escrow deposits. Escrow earnings reflect interest income net of interest paid to the borrower, if required, which generally equals a money market rate. Escrow earnings tend to increase as short-term interest rates increase as they did in 2017 and 2018 but tend to decline as short-term interest rates decrease as they did in the latter part of 2019. Also included with escrow earnings and other interest income are interest earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and interest income earned on our pledged securities. Interest income from pledged securities increased during 2019 as we sold investments in money market funds and invested those proceeds in higher-earning multifamily Agency mortgage-backed securities ( Agency MBS\u201d).\nOther revenues. Other revenues are comprised of fees for processing loan assumptions, prepayment fee income, application fees, property sales broker fees, income from equity-method investments, income from preferred equity investments, asset management fees, and other miscellaneous revenues related to our operations.\nCosts and Expenses\nPersonnel. Personnel expense includes the cost of employee compensation and benefits, which include fixed and discretionary amounts tied to company and individual performance, commissions, severance expense, signing and retention bonuses, and share-based compensation.\nAmortization and Depreciation. Amortization and depreciation is principally comprised of amortization of our MSRs, net of amortization of our guaranty obligations. The MSRs are amortized using the interest method over the period that servicing income is expected to be received. We amortize the guaranty obligations evenly over their expected lives. When the loan underlying an OMSR prepays, we write off the remaining unamortized balance, net of any related guaranty obligation, and record the write off to Amortization and depreciation. Similarly, when the loan underlying an OMSR defaults, we write the OMSR off to Amortization and depreciation. We depreciate property, plant, and equipment ratably over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization and depreciation also includes the amortization of intangible assets, principally related to the amortization of the mortgage pipeline and other intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions. We recognize amortization related to the mortgage pipeline intangible asset when a loan included in the mortgage pipeline intangible asset is rate locked or is no longer probable of rate locking. Also included in amortization and depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR. These intangible assets consisted primarily of asset management contracts, which had an estimated life at acquisition of five years. For the years presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to intangible assets associated with our acquisition of JCR in 2018.\nProvision (Benefit) for Credit Losses. The provision (benefit) for credit losses consists of two components: the provision associated with our risk-sharing loans and the provision associated with our loans held for investment. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with risk-sharing loans is established at the loan level when the borrower has defaulted on the loan or is probable of defaulting on the loan or collectively for loans that are not probable of default but on a watch list. The provision (benefit) for credit losses associated with our loans held for investment is established collectively for loans that are not impaired and individually for loans that are impaired. Our estimates of property fair value are based on appraisals, broker opinions of value, or net operating income and market capitalization rates, whichever we believe is the best estimate of the net disposition value.\nInterest Expense on Corporate Debt. Interest expense on corporate debt includes interest expense incurred and amortization of debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs related to our term loan facility.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include sub-servicing costs, facilities costs, travel and entertainment costs, marketing costs, professional fees, license fees, dues and subscriptions, corporate insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company is a C-corporation subject to both federal and state corporate tax. As of December 31, 2019, our estimated combined statutory federal and state tax rate was approximately 25.0% compared to approximately 25.1% as of December 31, 2018 and 38.2% as of December 31, 2017. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Reform\u201d) was enacted. Tax Reform significantly reduced the federal income tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. Except for the effects of Tax Reform, our combined statutory tax rate has historically not varied significantly as the only material difference in the calculation of the combined statutory tax rate from year to year is the apportionment of our taxable income amongst the various states where we are subject to taxation since we do not have foreign operations or significant permanent differences. For example, from the period since we went public in 2010 through 2017, our combined statutory tax rate varied by only 0.7%, with a low of 38.2% and a high of 38.9%. Absent additional significant legislative changes to statutory tax rates (particularly the federal tax rate), we expect minimal deviation from the 2019 combined statutory tax rate for future years. However, we do expect some variability in the effective tax rate going forward due to excess tax benefits recognized and limitations on the deductibility of certain book expenses as a result of Tax Reform, primarily related to executive compensation.\nExcess tax benefits recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reduced income tax expense by $4.6 million, $6.8 million, and $9.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the excess tax benefits from 2017 to 2018 related primarily to the aforementioned reduction in the combined statutory tax rate due to Tax Reform. The decrease from 2018 to 2019 largely reflects the limited deductibility of excess tax benefits related to executive compensation.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our annual results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future, reflecting the interest-rate environment, the volume of transactions, business acquisitions, regulatory actions, and general economic conditions.

note 2 to the table below) due primarily to an increase in debt financing volume, (ii) servicing fees due to a year-over-year increase in the average servicing portfolio, (iii) net warehouse interest income from loans held for investment due to a substantially higher average balance of loans held for investment year over year, (iv) escrow earnings and other interest income principally related to increases in the escrow balances of loans serviced and the annual average escrow earnings rate, (v) property sales broker fees as a result of a nearly doubling of property sales volume year over year, and (vi) other revenues primarily from an increase in prepayment fees. Partially offsetting the increases in other revenue streams was a decrease in net warehouse interest income from loans held for sale due to a lower net interest spread on loans held for sale year over year.\nThe increase in total expenses was due primarily to increases in (i) personnel expense mostly due to increases in salaries expense resulting from a rise in average headcount year over year and commissions costs due to the increases in loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net and property sales broker fees, (ii) amortization and depreciation costs due to an increase in the average balance of MSRs outstanding year over year, (iii) provision for credit losses due to three loan defaults in 2019 compared to none in 2018, and (iv) other operating expenses due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the average headcount and an increase in recruiting costs.\nRevenues\nThe following table provides additional information that helps explain changes in origination fees and mortgage servicing rights over the past three years:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Financing Volume by Product Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fannie Mae\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freddie Mac\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ginnie Mae - HUD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interim Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n "}
