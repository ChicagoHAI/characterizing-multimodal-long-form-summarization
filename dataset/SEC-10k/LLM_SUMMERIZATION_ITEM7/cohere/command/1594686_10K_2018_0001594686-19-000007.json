Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capitalized terms not defined in this Item 7 shall have the definitions ascribed to those terms in Items 1-6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview-Basis of Presentation\nWPG Inc. is an Indiana corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed REIT, under the Code. WPG Inc. will generally qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as it continues to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, and satisfy certain other requirements. WPG Inc. will generally be allowed a deduction against its U.S. federal income tax liability for dividends paid by it to REIT shareholders, thereby reducing or eliminating any corporate level taxation to WPG Inc. WPG L.P. is WPG Inc.'s majority-owned limited partnership subsidiary that owns, develops and manages, through its affiliates, all of WPG Inc.'s real estate properties and other assets. WPG Inc. is the sole general partner of WPG L.P. On May 28, 2014, WPG separated from SPG through the distribution of 100% of the outstanding units of WPG L.P. to the owners of SPG L.P. and 100% of the outstanding shares of WPG Inc. to the SPG common shareholders in a tax-free distribution. Prior to the separation, WPG Inc. and WPG L.P. were wholly owned subsidiaries of the SPG Businesses. On January 15, 2015, the Company acquired Glimcher Realty Trust in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. As of December 31, 2018, our assets consisted of material interests in 108 shopping centers in the United States, consisting of open air properties and enclosed retail properties, comprised of approximately 58 million square feet of managed GLA.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include the accounts of WPG Inc. and WPG L.P., as well as their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated statements of operations include the consolidated accounts of the Company. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLeadership Changes and Severance Impacting Financial Results\n2019 Activity\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company's Executive Vice President, Head of Open Air Centers, was terminated without cause from his position and received severance payments and other benefits pursuant to the terms and conditions of his employment agreement. In addition, the Company terminated, without cause, additional non-executive personnel in the Property Management department as part of an effort to reduce overhead costs. The Company expects to record aggregate severance charges of approximately $1.9 million, including $0.1 million of non-cash stock compensation in the form of accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards.\n2018 Activity\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company's Executive Vice President, Property Management was terminated without cause from his position and received severance payments and other benefits pursuant to the terms and conditions of his employment agreement. In addition, the Company terminated without cause additional non-executive personnel in the Property Management department. In connection with and as part of the aforementioned management and personnel changes, the Company recorded aggregate severance charges of $2.0 million, including $0.5 million of non-cash stock compensation in the form of accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards, which costs are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2016 Activity\nOn June 20, 2016, the Company announced the following leadership changes: (1) the resignation of Mr. Michael P. Glimcher as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board; (2) the appointment of Mr. Louis G. Conforti, a current Board member, as Interim Chief Executive Officer; (3) the resignation of Mr. Mark S. Ordan as non-executive Chairman of the Board; and (4) the resignation of Mr. Niles C. Overly from the Board. In July of 2016, the Company terminated some additional executive and non-executive personnel as part of an effort to reduce overhead costs. On October 6, 2016, the Company announced that Mr. Conforti would serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer for a term ending December 31, 2019, subject to early termination clauses and automatic renewals pursuant to his employment agreement.\nIn connection with and as part of the aforementioned management changes, the Company recorded aggregate charges of $29.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $25.5 million related to severance and restructuring-related costs, including $9.5 million of non-cash stock compensation for accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards, and $4.1 million related to fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Company's investigation of various strategic alternatives, which costs are included in merger, restructuring and transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe Facility\nOn January 22, 2018, WPG L.P. amended and restated $1.0 billion of the existing unsecured revolving credit facility, or \"Revolver\" and unsecured term loan, or \"Term Loan\" (collectively known as the \"Facility\"). The recasted Facility can be increased to $1.5 billion through currently uncommitted Facility commitments. Excluding the accordion feature, the recasted Facility includes a $650.0 million Revolver and $350.0 million Term Loan. The interest rates for the Revolver and Term Loan remained substantially consistent with the previous terms. When considering extension options, the recasted Facility will mature on December 30, 2022. The $350.0 million Term Loan was fully funded at closing, and the Company used the proceeds to repay the $270.0 million outstanding on the June 2015 Term Loan and to pay down the Revolver.\nSouthgate Mall\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall, located in Missoula, Montana, for $58.0 million. The enclosed retail property contains approximately 631,000 square feet of GLA and is anchored by a recently constructed AMC Theater, a new Lucky's Market grocer that replaced a portion of a former Sears, J.C. Penney (non-owned) and Dillard's (non-owned) and is the dominant retail center in this secondary market, with no competitive destination retail property located within 130 miles.\nOn September 27, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. closed on a $35.0 million full-recourse mortgage note payable with a three-year term and a fixed rate of 4.48% secured by Southgate Mall. The mortgage note payable requires interest only payments and will initially mature on September 27, 2021, subject to two one-year extensions available at our option subject to compliance with the terms of the underlying loan agreement and payment of customary extension fees. The proceeds were used to reduce corporate debt and for ongoing redevelopment efforts.\nSears Parcel Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2018, we acquired, through a sale-leaseback transaction, four Sears department stores and adjacent Sears Auto Centers at Longview Mall, located in Longview, Texas; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae, located in Columbus, Ohio; Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa; and Town Center at Aurora, located in Aurora, Colorado. The purchase price was approximately $28.5 million and was funded by a combination of $13.4 million from our Facility, $9.7 million from the first tranche of the Four Corners transaction, as discussed in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Outparcel Sale,\" and $5.4 million from our joint venture partner related to their pro-rata share of the joint venture that owns Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae. We have control of these stores for future redevelopment and Sears, depending on the outcome of their bankruptcy proceedings, will continue to operate under new leases, providing aggregate minimum rent under these leases of approximately $1.25 million per annum. In addition, under the terms of these leases, Sears is responsible for paying common area maintenance charges, taxes, insurance and utilities while they operate the stores. Other than the store at Town Center at Aurora, Sears has announced plans to close the remaining three stores in the first quarter of 2019.\nSears Bankruptcy\nOn October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and announced additional store closings. As of December 31, 2018, we had 35 Sears stores totaling approximately 4.9 million square feet of GLA within the portfolio of properties we manage, which were responsible for approximately 0.8% of our total annualized base minimum rents. We own 17 of the stores, Sears owns eight stores and third parties (including Seritage Growth Properties) own 10 stores. Sears has announced plans to close a number of stores during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, Sears has entered into an asset purchase agreement which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court\u201d) on February 8, 2019. Certain of our leases may be assumed and assigned as part of the asset purchase transaction, while other stores may be closed as part of Sears' ongoing store closings. After the announced closures, we expect to have 10 Sears stores operating in our portfolio, subject to the outcome of the ongoing proceedings. In addition to the risk of lost base minimum rent from Sears, co-tenancy clauses in leases for in-line retailers may trigger as a result of Sears store closures, and losses could be significant. We considered the impact of the bankruptcy announcement in our evaluation of impairment, including announced closures, noting no impairment charges were warranted as of December 31, 2018. We are in various stages of redevelopment for many of these stores (see details under \"Development Activity\").\nOutparcel Sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of various tranches of restaurant outparcels to FCPT Acquisitions, LLC (\"Four Corners\") pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement executed on September 20, 2017 between the Company and Four Corners.\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of each tranche (dollars in thousands):\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Parcels Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 12, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 27, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company used the proceeds to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Sears parcels on April 11, 2018 as discussed above, to reduce corporate debt, and to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts. On January 18, 2019, we completed the sixth tranche of restaurant outparcels. This tranche consisted of eight restaurant outparcels. Additionally on February 11, 2019, we closed on the sale of one additional restaurant outparcel. The allocated purchase price was approximately $12.2 million, and the net proceeds of approximately $12.1 million were used to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts and for general corporate purposes. The Company expects to close on the remaining 15 outparcels for approximately $25.3 million during the first half of 2019, subject to due diligence and closing conditions.\nThe O'Connor Joint Ventures\nThe Company has two joint ventures with O'Connor Mall Partners, L.P. (\"O'Connor\").\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture I\nThis investment consists of a 51% noncontrolling interest held by the Company in a portfolio of five enclosed retail properties and related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Mall at Johnson City located in Johnson City, Tennessee; Pearlridge Center located in Aiea, Hawaii; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae; Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae located in Scottsdale, Arizona; and Town Center Plaza (which consists of Town Center Plaza and the adjacent Town Center Crossing) located in Leawood, Kansas. We retain management, leasing, and development responsibilities for the O'Connor Joint Venture I.\nOn April 11, 2018, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on the acquisition of the Sears department store located at Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae in connection with our acquisition of additional Sears department stores (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Sears Parcel Acquisitions\").\nOn March 2, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I acquired an additional section at Pearlridge Center for a gross purchase price of $70.0 million. Pearlridge Center is currently comprised of two distinct enclosed venues commonly referred to as Uptown and Downtown. The acquired section consists of approximately 153,000 square feet, which is part of Uptown (and referenced herein as Pearlridge Uptown II), and is anchored by Ross Dress for Less and TJ Maxx. Subsequent to the purchase, the joint venture placed secured debt on the property (see below for details). Our share of the purchase price was funded by a combination of our share of the secured debt and availability on our credit facility.\nOn March 30, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $43.2 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with an eight year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.071% secured by Pearlridge Uptown II. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until April 1, 2019, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $22.0 million.\nOn March 29, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $55.0 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with a ten year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.36% secured by sections of Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae known as Block K and Block M. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until May 1, 2022, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $28.1 million.\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture II\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed an additional joint venture transaction with O'Connor with respect to the ownership and operation of seven of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Arboretum, located in Austin, Texas; Arbor Hills, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Classen Curve and The Triangle at Classen Curve, each located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills Plaza, located in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma (the \"Oklahoma City Properties,\" collectively); Gateway Centers, located in Austin, Texas; Malibu Lumber Yard, located in Malibu, California; Palms Crossing I and II, located in McAllen, Texas and The Shops at Arbor Walk, located in Austin, Texas (the \"O'Connor Joint Venture II\"). The transaction valued the properties at $598.6 million before closing adjustments and debt assumptions.\nUnder the terms of the joint venture agreement, we retained a non-controlling 51% interest in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and sold the remaining 49% to O'Connor. The transaction generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $138.9 million, after taking into consideration costs associated with the transaction and the assumption of debt (including the new mortgage loans on The Arboretum, Gateway Centers, and Oklahoma City Properties which closed prior to the joint venture transaction; see \"Financing & Debt\" below for net proceeds to the Company from the new mortgage loans), which we used to reduce the Company's debt as well as for general corporate purposes. At the time of closing, we deconsolidated the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and recorded a gain in connection with this partial sale of $126.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The gain was recorded pursuant to ASC 360-20 and calculated based upon proceeds received, less 49% of the book value of the deconsolidated net assets. Our retained 51% non-controlling equity method interest was valued at historical cost based upon the pro rata book value of the retained interest in the net assets. We retain management and leasing responsibilities for the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II. In connection with the formation of this joint venture, we recorded transaction costs of approximately $6.4 million as part of our basis in this investment.\nImpairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, a major anchor tenant of Rushmore Mall, located in Rapid City, South Dakota, informed us of their intention to close their store at the property. The impending closure was deemed a triggering event and, therefore, we evaluated this property in conjunction with our quarterly impairment review and preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We compared the estimated fair value of $37.5 million to the related carrying value of $75.0 million, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $37.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn October 4, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell Colonial Park Mall, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to an unaffiliated private real estate investor, which was sold on November 3, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, we shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for this asset, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. We compared the fair value measurement of the property to its relative carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $20.9 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of Morgantown Commons, located in Morgantown, West Virginia, which was sold in the second quarter of 2017. We shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for the asset during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. The purchase offer represented the best available evidence of fair value for this property. We compared the fair value to the carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $8.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $21.9 million primarily related to noncore properties consisting of Gulf View Square, located in Port Richey, Florida; Richmond Town Square, located in Cleveland, Ohio; River Oaks Center, located in Chicago, Illinois; and Virginia Center Commons, located in Glen Allen, Virginia. The impairment charge was attributed to the continued declines in the fair value of the properties and executed agreements entered into in 2016 to sell these properties at prices below the carrying value. Each of the aforementioned noncore properties has been sold in accordance with the Company's strategic objectives.\nHurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma made landfall in Houston, Texas and Southern Florida, respectively. The Company had 15 assets experience damage attributed to the hurricanes, but no asset sustained catastrophic damage nor was there any loss of life. Further, no asset experienced a significant loss of business or functionality. The Company recognized approximately $900,000 of expense attributed to the damage, repairs and asset write-offs, which was below insurance deductible thresholds.\nBusiness Opportunities\nWe derive our revenues primarily from retail tenant leases, including fixed minimum rent leases, percentage rent leases based on tenants' sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses. We seek to re-lease our spaces at higher rents and increase our occupancy rates, and to enhance the performance of our properties and increase our revenues by, among other things, adding or replacing anchors or big-box tenants, re-developing or renovating existing properties to increase the leasable square footage, and increasing the productivity of occupied locations through aesthetic upgrades, re-merchandising and/or changes to the retail use of the space. We seek growth in earnings, FFO and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments.\nAdditionally, we feel there are opportunities to enhance our portfolio and balance sheet through active portfolio management. We believe that there are opportunities for us to acquire additional shopping centers that match our investment and strategic criteria. We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We also seek to dispose of or contribute to a joint venture assets that no longer meet our strategic criteria. These dispositions will be a combination of asset sales and transitions of over-levered properties to lenders or special servicers.\nWe consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable NOI (NOI for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this report.\nPortfolio Data\nThe portfolio data discussed in this overview includes key operating statistics for the Company including ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot and comparable NOI for the core properties owned at December 31, 2018. Towne West Square, located in Wichita, Kansas, and West Ridge Mall, located in Topeka, Kansas were identified as noncore properties.\nCore business fundamentals in the overall portfolio during 2018 were generally stable compared to 2017. Ending occupancy for the core portfolio was 93.9% as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 93.5% as of December 31, 2017. Average base minimum rent per square foot for the core portfolio decreased by 0.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. Comparable NOI decreased 3.0% for the core portfolio when comparing calendar year 2018 to 2017. Our core enclosed retail properties had a decrease in comparable NOI of 3.5%, which was driven primarily by the impact of 2018 department store bankruptcies filed and related co-tenancy impact. The core open air properties had a comparable NOI decrease of 1.7% in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily related to the Toys R Us bankruptcy and lower CAM capital spending in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth key operating statistics for the combined portfolio of core properties or interests in properties:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending occupancy (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average base minimum rent per square foot (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Ending occupancy is the percentage of GLA which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period.

The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $23.82 per square foot (\"psf\") and for renewed leases was $26.87 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $31.54 psf for new leases and $5.23 psf for renewals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we signed new leases and renewal leases with terms in excess of a year (excluding enclosed retail property anchors, majors, offices and in-line spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet) across the comparable core portfolio, comprising approximately 2,497,800 square feet. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $24.78 psf and for renewed leases was $25.26 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $36.05 psf for new leases and $3.40 psf for renewals.\nPortfolio Summary\nWe have provided some of our key operating metrics for our core enclosed retail property portfolio in different tiers. The purpose of the disclosure is to provide some distinction between the characteristics of the core enclosed retail properties. Tier 1 enclosed retail properties generally have higher occupancy, sales productivity and growth profiles, while Tier 2 enclosed retail properties are viable enclosed retail properties with lower productivity and modest growth profiles.\nThe table below provides some of our key metrics for the core enclosed retail property tiers as well as some key metrics for our open air property

in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We generally accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Many of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold as defined in their lease. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, ending occupancy, estimated market values or our decision to dispose of a property before the end of its estimated useful life. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, irrespective of changes in circumstances. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to expense the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, leasing prospects and local market information. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To maintain its status as a REIT, WPG Inc. must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests.

In the unlikely event that WPG Inc. fails to maintain REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then it would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period it did not qualify as a REIT. If WPG Inc. lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We make estimates as part of our recording of property acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the recording of the fair value of buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the recording of the fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as tenant sales, rents per square foot, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties.

The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed when it is held available for occupancy, and accordingly, cease capitalization of costs upon opening.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAdoption of New Standards\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" using the modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014-09 revised GAAP by offering a single comprehensive revenue recognition standard instead of numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions. The impacted revenue streams primarily consist of fees earned from management, development and leasing services provided to joint ventures in which we own an interest and other ancillary income earned from our properties. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase equity of approximately $2.5 million related to changes in the revenue recognition pattern of lease commissions earned by the Company from our joint ventures. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nAdditionally, we adopted the clarified scope guidance of ASC 610-20, \"Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\" in conjunction with ASU 2014-09, using the modified retrospective approach. ASC 610-20 applies to the sale, transfer and derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales, and eliminates the guidance specific to real estate in ASC 360-20. With respect to full disposals, the recognition will generally be consistent with our current measurement and pattern of recognition. With respect to partial sales of real estate to joint ventures, the new guidance requires us to recognize a full gain where an equity investment is retained. These transactions could result in a basis difference as we will be required to measure our retained equity interest at fair value, whereas the joint venture may continue to measure the assets received at carryover basis. No adjustments were required upon adoption of this standard.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\" ASU 2017-12 aims to reduce complexity in cash value hedges of interest rate risk and eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, generally requiring the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.6 million between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\" and ASU 2016-18 \"Restricted Cash\" using a retrospective transition approach, which changed our statements of cash flows and related disclosures for all periods presented. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows and its adoption had no impact on our financial statements. ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2017, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.9 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $6.4 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $1.7 million were reclassified. For the year ended December 31, 2016, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $0.8 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $1.5 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $10.4 million were reclassified. Restricted cash primarily relates to cash held in escrow for payment of real estate taxes and property reserves for maintenance, expansion or leasehold improvements as required by our mortgage loans. Restricted cash is included in \"Deferred costs and other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nNew Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.\nIn July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment that provides an entity the optional transition method to initially account for the impact of the adoption ASU 2016-02 with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019 (the effective date of the ASU), rather than January 1, 2017, which would eliminate the need to restate amounts presented prior to January 1, 2019. We will utilize this optional transition method. From a lessee perspective, the Company currently has four material ground leases, two material office leases, and one material garage lease that, under the new guidance, will result in the recognition of a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. As of December 31, 2018, undiscounted future minimum lease payments due under these leases total approximately $31.1 million with termination dates which range from 2023 to 2076 and we expect the recognized lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset to not exceed $20.0 million upon adoption.\nFrom a lessor perspective, the new guidance remains mostly similar to current rules, though contract consideration will now be allocated between lease and non-lease components. Non-lease component allocations will be recognized under ASU 2014-09, and we expect that this will result in a different pattern of recognition for certain non-lease components, including for fixed common-area (\"CAM\") revenues.\nHowever, the FASB's amendment to ASU 2016-02 referred to above allows lessors to elect, as a practical expedient, not to allocate the total consideration to lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone selling prices. This practical expedient allows lessors to elect a combined single lease component presentation if (i) the timing and pattern of the revenue recognition of the combined single lease component is the same, and (ii) the combined single component would be classified as an operating lease. We believe we meet the criteria to use this practical expedient and we plan to elect this practical expedient upon the effective date. In addition, ASU 2016-02 limits the capitalization of leasing costs to initial direct costs, which will likely result in a reduction to our capitalized leasing costs and an increase to general and administrative expenses, though the amount of such changes is highly dependent upon the leasing compensation structures in place at the time of adoption. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company deferred $17.7 million and $16.9 million of internal leasing costs, respectively. From a lessor perspective, other than the reduction to capitalized leasing costs and increase to general and administrative expenses related to internal leasing costs based on the Company's current leasing compensation structure, which is not expected to change significantly upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \"Fair Value Measurements (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements.\" ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures, modifies certain disclosures, and adds additional disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following acquisitions and dispositions affected our results in the comparative periods:\n\u2022On November 16, 2018, we completed the sale of the fifth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 31, 2018, we completed the sale of the fourth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 23, 2018, we transitioned Rushmore Mall to the lender.\n\u2022On July 27, 2018, we completed the sale of the third tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On June 29, 2018, we completed the sale of the second tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On April 24, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall.\n\u2022On April 11, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of four Sears department stores located at Longview Mall, Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae (unconsolidated), Southern Hills Mall, and Town Center at Aurora.\n\u2022On January 12, 2018, we completed the sale of the first tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On November 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Colonial Park Mall.\n\u2022On October 17, 2017, we completed a discounted payoff of the mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\u2022On October 3, 2017, we transitioned Valle Vista Mall, located in Harlingen, Texas, to the lender.\n\u2022On June 13, 2017, we sold 49% of our interest in Malibu Lumber Yard as part of the O'Connor Joint Venture II transaction.\n\u2022On June 7, 2017, we completed the sale of Morgantown Commons.\n\u2022On May 16, 2017, we completed the sale of an 80,000 square foot vacant anchor parcel at Indian Mound Mall, located in Heath, Ohio.\n\u2022On May 12, 2017, we completed the transaction forming the O'Connor Joint Venture II with regard to the ownership and operation of six of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels.

The decrease in merger, restructuring and transaction costs of $29.6 million was attributable to the management transition as well as strategic alternatives explored during 2016 and no comparable costs occurring in 2017. The increase of $45.0 million in impairment losses recorded in 2017 relate to the write down of Rushmore Mall, Colonial Park Mall and Morgantown Commons, as described in further detail under \"Impairment,\" when compared to the impairments taken during the comparable period in 2016.\nInterest expense, net, decreased $9.7 million, of which $7.5 million was attributable to the Property Transactions, $11.0 million was attributable to the discounted payoffs of the mortgage loans secured by Mesa Mall and Southern Hills Mall, respectively, and $3.3 million was attributable to the O'Connor Joint Venture II properties. Offsetting these decreases were increases of $11.4 million related to corporate debt activity, primarily related to the August 2017 bond offering offset by reduced Revolver activity, reductions in term loan interest expense, and swap ineffectiveness, and $0.7 million related to other financing activities.\nGain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the 2017 period consisted of a net gain of $124.8 million from the sales of Colonial Park Mall, Morgantown Commons, a vacant anchor parcel at Indian Mound Mall, the O'Connor Joint Venture II transaction, Gulf View Square, River Oaks Center, and Virginia Center Commons. The $2.0 million loss in the 2016 period occurred from the sales of Richmond Town Square, Knoxville Center, Forest Mall, and Northlake Mall.\nGain on extinguishment of debt recognized in the 2017 period consisted of $90.6 million gain related to the discounted payoff of the $99.7 million mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall, transitioning of $40.0 million mortgage loan secured by Valle Vista Mall to the lender, and the discounted payoff of the $87.3 million mortgage loan secured by Mesa Mall. The gain on extinguishment of debt, net recognized in the 2016 period consisted of the $34.6 million net gain from the transitioning of River Valley Mall, Merritt Square Mall, and Chesapeake Square to the lenders.\nIncome and other taxes increased $1.2 million, which was attributable primarily to a nonrecurring state use tax that was incurred in 2017.\nFor WPG Inc., net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily relates to the allocation of income to third parties based on their respective weighted average ownership interest in WPG L.P., which percentage remained consistent over the periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, working capital, debt repayment, including principal and interest, reinvestment in properties, development and redevelopment of properties, tenant allowance and dividends. Our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow and borrowings under our debt arrangements, including our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or \"Revolver\", unsecured notes payable and senior unsecured term loans as further discussed below.\nWe derive most of our liquidity from leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations, the total of which was $287.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased $9.5 million during 2018 to $42.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to net repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and capital expenditures, partially offset by operating cash flow from properties, net distributions from our joint ventures, and the net proceeds from the disposition of properties. See \"Cash Flows\" below for more information.\nBecause we own primarily long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies on a combination of long-term mortgage debt as well as unsecured debt supported by a quality unencumbered asset pool, providing us with ample flexibility from a liquidity perspective. Our strategy is to have the majority of our debt fixed either through fixed rate mortgages or interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate. At December 31, 2018, floating rate debt (excluding loans hedged to fixed interest) comprised 15.2% of our total consolidated debt. We will continue to monitor our borrowing mix to limit market risk.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we successfully completed the issuance of $750.0 million of unsecured notes. The notes are due on August 15, 2024 and the proceeds were used to repay the $500.0 million Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\"), with a maturity date of May 30, 2018 and $230.0 million of the June 2015 Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\") with a maturity date of March 2, 2020, respectively.\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2018, we amended and restated our Facility (as defined under \"The Facility.\"). Under the amended and restated terms, the Facility will mature in December 2022 assuming all extension options are exercised. Prior to the amendment and restatement, the Revolver matured on May 30, 2019, assuming all extension options were exercised. These transactions are reflective of our strategy to access the unsecured debt markets to extend our weighted average debt maturity.\nOn December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $359.8 million under the Revolver, net of outstanding borrowings of $290.0 million and $0.2 million reserved for outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average interest rate on the Revolver was 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, Fitch Ratings & Moody's Investor Service lowered their credit rating on WPG L.P.'s unsecured long-term indebtedness, which will increase interest rates on our Facility (as defined in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - The Facility.\"), December 2015 Term Loan, and 5.950% Notes due 2024 as of February 2, 2019. Due to the downgrade, our Revolver will bear interest at LIBOR plus 165 basis points (an increase of 40 basis points), our Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 190 basis points (an increase of 45 basis points), and our December 2015 Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 235 basis points (an increase of 55 basis points). Our 5.950% Notes due 2024 will bear interest at 6.450% (an increase of 50 basis points). Assuming the new pricing grid was effective January 1, 2018, the impact would have resulted in an increase in borrowing costs of approximately $8.5 million during 2018. Such a downgrade may also impact terms and conditions of future borrowings in addition to adversely affecting our ability to access the public markets.\nThe consolidated indebtedness of our business was approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, or an increase of approximately $39.9 million from December 31, 2017. The change in consolidated indebtedness from December 31, 2017 is described in greater detail under \"Financing and Debt.\"\nOutlook\nOur business model and WPG Inc.'s status as a REIT requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. We may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand, availability under the Revolver and cash flow from operations to address our debt maturities, distributions and capital needs through 2019.\nThe successful execution of our business strategy will require the availability of substantial amounts of operating and development capital both currently and over time. Sources of such capital could include additional bank borrowings, public and private offerings of debt or equity, including rights offerings, sale of certain assets and joint ventures. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2018, but there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future (see discussion above for further details).\nCash Flows\nOur net cash flow from operating activities totaled $287.2 million during 2018. During 2018, we also:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>funded capital expenditures of $153.9 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>received net proceeds from the disposition of interests in properties and outparcels of $39.2 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $20.2 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>received distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $35.1 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>received net proceeds from our debt financing, refinancing, and repayment activities of $120.4 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>funded distributions to common and preferred shareholders and unitholders of $236.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and distributions to shareholders necessary to maintain WPG Inc.'s status as a REIT on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building renovations and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>borrowings on our debt arrangements,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>opportunistic asset sales,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>additional equity raised in the public or private markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2019, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from our debt arrangements, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.\nFinancing and Debt\nMortgage Debt\nTotal mortgage indebtedness at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount of mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>980,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,152,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value adjustments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance cost, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrying value of mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>983,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,157,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA roll forward of mortgage indebtedness from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,157,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt amortization payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt borrowings, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt canceled upon lender foreclosures, net of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of fair value and other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,574\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>983,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 23, 2018, the $94.0 million mortgage on Rushmore Mall was canceled upon a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreement (see \"Covenants\" section below for additional details).\nOn October 2, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. repaid the $8.3 million mortgage loan on Whitehall Mall, located in Whitehall, Pennsylvania. This repayment was funded by cash on hand.\nOn September 27, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. closed on a $35.0 million full-recourse note payable secured by Southgate Mall (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Southgate\").\nOn June 8, 2018, the Company exercised the first of three options to extend the maturity date of the $65.0 million term loan secured by Weberstown Mall, located in Stockton, California, for one year. The extended maturity date is June 8, 2019, subject to two one year extensions available at our option subject to compliance with the terms of the underlying loan agreement and payment of customary extension fees.\nOn January 19, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. repaid the $86.5 million mortgage loan on The Outlet Collection\u00ae | Seattle. This repayment was funded by borrowings on the Revolver (as defined below).\nOn December 29, 2017, an affiliate of WPG Inc. repaid the $11.7 million mortgage loan secured by Henderson Square, located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. This repayment was funded by cash on hand.\nOn October 17, 2017, an affiliate of WPG Inc. completed a discounted payoff of the $99.7 million mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall for $55.0 million (see \"Covenants\" section below for additional details).\nOn October 3, 2017, the $40.0 million mortgage on Valle Vista Mall was canceled upon a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreement (see \"Covenants\" section below for additional details).\nOn October 2, 2017, an affiliate of WPG Inc. repaid the $99.6 million mortgage loan on WestShore Plaza, located in Tampa, Florida. This repayment was funded by borrowings on the Revolver.\nOn May 10, 2017 and prior to the deconsolidation of these properties due to the sale of 49% of our interests (see section \"The O'Connor Joint Ventures\" for additional details), the Company closed on non-recourse mortgage loans encumbering The Arboretum, Gateway Centers, and Oklahoma City Properties.

We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the Revolver, as defined below. These three loans were deconsolidated during the year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the completion of the O'Connor Joint Venture II transaction.\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company completed a discounted payoff of the $87.3 million mortgage loan secured by Mesa Mall for $63.0 million (see \"Covenants\" section below for additional details).\nHighly-levered Assets\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have identified two mortgage loans that have leverage levels in excess of our targeted leverage and have plans to work with the special servicers on these non-recourse mortgages. These mortgage loans total $95.1 million and encumber Towne West Square and West Ridge Mall and West Ridge Plaza, all of which have been identified as noncore properties. We expect to improve our leverage once all, or a portion of them, are transitioned to the lenders, with minimal impact to net cash flows. See \"Covenants\" below for further discussion on these highly-levered assets.\nUnsecured Debt\nThe following table identifies our total unsecured debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount - the Exchange Notes(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount - 5.950% Notes due 2024(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt discount, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,680\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total carrying value of notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>982,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>979,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured term loans:(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount - Term Loan(3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount - December 2015 Term Loan(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount - June 2015 Term Loan(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total carrying value of unsecured term loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>685,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility:(3)(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total carrying value of revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The Exchange Notes were issued at a 0.028% discount, bear interest at 3.850% per annum and mature on April 1, 2020.\n(2) The 5.950% Notes due 2024 were issued at a 1.533% discount, bear interest at 5.950% per annum, and mature on August 15, 2024. The interest rate could vary in the future based upon changes to the Company's credit ratings. In February 2019, the Company's credit rating was downgraded which will result in an interest rate increase of 50 basis points to 6.450%.\n(3) The Revolver and Term Loan are collectively known as the Facility, as defined in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - The Facility.\"\n(4) The Term Loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.45% per annum and will mature on December 30, 2022. We had interest rate swap agreements totaling $270.0 million, which effectively fixed the interest rate on a portion of the Term Loan at 2.56% per annum through June 30, 2018. On May 9, 2018, we executed swap agreements totaling $250.0 million to replace matured swap agreements, which effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of the Term Loan at 4.21% through June 30, 2021. At December 31, 2018, the applicable interest rate on the unhedged portion of the Term Loan was one-month LIBOR plus 1.45% or 3.95%. In February 2019, the Company's credit rating was downgraded which will result in an interest rate increase of 45 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.90%.\n(5) The December 2015 Term Loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.80% per annum and will mature on January 10, 2023. We have interest rate swap agreements totaling $340.0 million, which effectively fix the interest rate at 3.51% per annum through maturity. In February 2019, the Company's credit rating was downgraded which will result in an interest rate increase of 55 basis points to LIBOR plus 2.35%.\n(6) The June 2015 Term Loan bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.45% per annum. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repaid $230.0 million of the June 2015 Term Loan and wrote off $0.9 million of debt issuance costs. On January 22, 2018, the Company repaid the remaining $270.0 million outstanding with proceeds from the amended and restated Facility (as discussed above) and wrote off $0.5 million of debt issuance costs.\n(7) As of December 31, 2017, the Revolver provided borrowings on a revolving basis up to $900.0 million, bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.25%, and was initially scheduled to mature on May 30, 2018. On January 22, 2018, we amended the terms of the Revolver to provide borrowings on a revolving basis up to $650.0 million at one-month LIBOR plus 1.25%. Under the amended terms, the Revolver will mature on December 30, 2021, subject to two six months month extensions available at our option subject to compliance with terms of the Facility and payment of a customary extension fee. Upon the amended terms, the Company wrote off $0.3 million of debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $359.8 million under the Revolver, net of $0.2 million reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, the applicable interest rate on the Revolver was one-month LIBOR plus 1.25%, or 3.75%. In February 2019, the Company's credit rating was downgraded which will result in an interest rate increase of 40 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.65%.\n(8) While we have interest rate swap agreements in place that fix the LIBOR portion of the rates as noted above, the spread over LIBOR could vary in the future based upon changes to the Company's credit ratings.\nCovenants\nOur unsecured debt agreements contain financial and other covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by one or more of the respective lenders including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2018, management believes the Company is in compliance with all covenants of its unsecured debt.\nThe total balance of mortgages was approximately $980.3 million as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, certain of our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 21 non-recourse loans and two full-recourse loans secured by mortgages encumbering 26 properties, including one separate pool of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of four properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. Our existing non-recourse mortgage loans generally prohibit our subsidiaries that are borrowers thereunder from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain customary and limited exceptions. In addition, certain of these instruments limit the ability of the applicable borrower's parent entity from incurring mezzanine indebtedness unless certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with maximum loan to value ratio and minimum debt service coverage ratio tests. Further, under certain of these existing agreements, if certain cash flow levels in respect of the applicable mortgaged property (as described in the applicable agreement) are not maintained for at least two consecutive quarters, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against its collateral. If the borrower fails to comply with these covenants, the lenders could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral.\nOn November 19, 2018, we received a notice of default letter, dated November 15, 2018, from the special servicer to the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of WPG L.P., concerning the $49.9 million mortgage loan secured by West Ridge Mall and West Ridge Plaza, located in Topeka, Kansas (collectively known as \"West Ridge\"). The notice was issued by the special servicer because the borrower did not make certain reserve payments or deposits as required by the loan agreement for the aforementioned loan. The borrower has initiated discussions with the special servicer regarding this non-recourse loan and is considering various options. The Company will continue to manage and lease the property.\nOn May 29, 2018, we received a notice of default letter, dated May 25, 2018, from the special servicer to the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of WPG L.P., concerning the $94.0 million mortgage loan secured by Rushmore Mall (\"Rushmore\"). The notice was issued by the special servicer because the borrower notified the lender that there were insufficient funds to ensure future compliance with the mortgage loan due to the loss of certain tenants at Rushmore. On October 23, 2018, an affiliate of the Company transitioned the property to the lender.\nOn April 11, 2018, we received a notice of default letter, dated April 6, 2018, from the special servicer to the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of WPG L.P., concerning the $45.2 million mortgage loan secured by Towne West Square, located in Wichita, Kansas. The notice was issued by the special servicer because the borrower did not make certain reserve payments or deposits as required by the loan agreement for the aforementioned loan. On August 24, 2018, we received notification that a receiver had been appointed to manage and lease the property. An affiliate of the Company still holds title to the property.\nOn March 30, 2017, the Company transferred the then $40.0 million mortgage loan secured by Valle Vista Mall to the special servicer at the request of the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. On May 18, 2017, we received a notice of default letter, dated that same date, from the special servicer because the borrower did not repay the loan in full by its May 10, 2017 maturity date. On October 3, 2017, an affiliate of WPG Inc. transitioned the property to the lender.\nOn June 6, 2016, we received a notice of default letter, dated June 3, 2016, from the special servicer to the borrower of the then $99.7 million mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall. The letter was sent because the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, did not repay the loan in full by its June 1, 2016 maturity date. On October 27, 2016, we received notification that a receiver had been appointed to manage and lease the property. On October 17, 2017, an affiliate of WPG Inc. completed a discounted payoff of the mortgage loan for $55.0 million and we retained ownership and management of the property.\nOn June 30, 2016, we received a notice, dated that same date, that the then $87.3 million mortgage loan secured by Mesa Mall had been transferred to the special servicer due to the payment default that occurred when the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, did not repay the loan in full by its June 1, 2016 maturity date. On April 25, 2017, the Company completed a discounted payoff of the mortgage loan for $63.0 million and retained ownership and management of the property.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recognized a net gain of $51.4 million related to the $94.0 million mortgage debt cancellation and ownership transfer of Rushmore Mall, which is included in gain on extinguishment of debt, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year then ended. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a net gain of $90.6 million based on the cancellation of mortgage debt of $108.9 million related to discounted payoff of the mortgage note payable secured by Southern Hills Mall, ownership transfer of Valle Vista Mall, and discounted payoff of the mortgage note payable secured by Mesa Mall, which is included in gain on extinguishment of debt, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year then ended.\nAt December 31, 2018, management believes the applicable borrowers under our other non-recourse mortgage loans were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has assessed each of the defaulted properties for impairment indicators and have concluded no impairment charges were warranted as of December 31, 2018.\nSummary of Financing\nOur consolidated debt and the effective weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nInterest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-rate debt, face amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,505,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,610,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable-rate debt, face amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total face amount of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,960,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,917,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,680\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value adjustments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total carrying value of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,937,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,897,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the material aspects of the Company's future obligations for consolidated entities as of December 31, 2018, assuming the obligations remain outstanding through maturities noted below (in thousands):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 - 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>665,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,960,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground rent/operating leases(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase/tenant obligations(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>906,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,345,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,670,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net fair value adjustments of $5,764, debt issuance costs of $(18,883) and bond discount of $(9,680) as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the principal maturities reflect any available extension options within the control of the Company.\n(2)Variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the LIBOR rate and our credit ratings in place at December 31, 2018. Due to the credit rating downgrade that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2018, we expect an increase of approximately $39.7 million in interest payments over the periods presented as a result of the new pricing grid based on the LIBOR rate in place at December 31, 2018.\n(3)Since there is no required redemption, distributions on the Series H Preferred Shares/Units, Series I Preferred Shares/Units and Series I-1 Preferred Units may be paid in perpetuity; for purposes of this table, such distributions are included upon declaration by the Board as the optional redemption dates have lapsed.\n(4)Represents minimum future lease payments due through the end of the initial lease term under executed leases.\n(5)Includes amounts due under executed leases and commitments to vendors for development and other matters.\nThe following table summarizes the material aspects of the Company's proportionate share of future obligations for unconsolidated entities as of December 31, 2018, assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 - 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground rent/operating leases(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase/tenant obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>761,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,012,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net fair value adjustments of $5,372 and debt issuance costs of $(2,451) as of December 31, 2018.

Joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2018, there were no guarantees of joint venture related mortgage indebtedness. In addition to obligations under mortgage indebtedness, our joint ventures have obligations under ground leases and purchase/tenant obligations. Our share of obligations under joint venture debt, ground leases and purchase/tenant obligations is quantified in the unconsolidated entities table within \"Contractual Obligations\" above. WPG may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.\nEquity Activity\nPreferred Stock\nSeries H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn January 15, 2015, WPG Inc. issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.5% Series H Preferred Shares to convert the preferred stock of GRT outstanding at the time of merger. Dividends accrue quarterly at an annual rate of 7.5% per share. WPG Inc. can redeem this series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. WPG L.P. issued to WPG Inc. a like number of preferred units as consideration for the Series H Preferred Shares and can redeem this series, in whole or in part, when WPG Inc. can redeem the Series H Preferred Shares at like terms. All shares remain issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nSeries I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn January 15, 2015, WPG Inc. issued 3,800,000 shares of 6.875% Series I Preferred Shares to convert the preferred stock of GRT outstanding at the time of merger. Dividends accrue quarterly at an annual rate of 6.875% per share. WPG Inc. can redeem this series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. WPG L.P. issued to WPG Inc. a like number of preferred units as consideration for the Series I Preferred Shares and can redeem this series, in whole or in part, when WPG Inc. can redeem the Series I Preferred Shares at like terms. All shares remain issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nExchange Rights\nSubject to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of WPG L.P., limited partners in WPG L.P. have, at their option, the right to exchange all or any portion of their units for shares of WPG Inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, as determined by WPG Inc. Therefore, the common units held by limited partners are considered by WPG Inc. to be share equivalents and classified as noncontrolling interests within permanent equity, and classified by WPG L.P. as permanent equity. The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the market value of WPG Inc.'s common stock as determined pursuant to the terms of the WPG L.P. Partnership Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2017, WPG Inc. issued 314,577 shares of common stock to a limited partner of WPG L.P. in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the WPG L.P. Partnership Agreement. This transaction increased WPG Inc.'s ownership interest in WPG L.P. There were no similar transactions during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. At December 31, 2018, WPG Inc. had reserved 34,755,660 shares of common stock for possible issuance upon the exchange of units held by limited partners.\nThe holders of the Series I-1 Preferred Units have, at their option, the right to have their units purchased by WPG L.P. subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Therefore, these preferred units are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity.\nShare Based Compensation\nOn May 28, 2014, the Board adopted the Washington Prime Group, L.P. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"), which permits the Company to grant awards to current and prospective directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any affiliate. An aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock has been reserved for issuance under the Plan. In addition, the maximum number of awards to be granted to a participant in any calendar year is 500,000 shares/units. Awards may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") or other stock-based awards in WPG Inc., long term incentive units (\"LTIP units\" or \"LTIPs\") or performance units (\"Performance LTIP Units\") in WPG L.P. The Plan terminates on May 28, 2024.\nLong Term Incentive Awards\nTime Vested LTIP Awards\nThe Company has issued time-vested LTIP units (\"Inducement LTIP Units\") to certain executive officers and employees under the Plan, pursuant to LTIP Unit Award Agreements between the Company and each of the grant recipients. These awards will vest and the related fair value will be expensed over a four-year vesting period. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not grant any Inducement LTIP Units. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated future compensation expense for Inducement LTIP Units was $37,500. The weighted average period over which the compensation expense will be recorded for the Inducement LTIP Units is approximately 0.2 years.\nPerformance Based Awards\n2015 Awards\nDuring 2015, the Company authorized the award of LTIP units subject to certain market conditions under ASC 718 (\"Performance LTIP Units\") to certain executive officers and employees of the Company in the maximum total amount of 304,818 units, to be earned and related fair value expensed over the applicable performance periods, except in certain instances that could result in accelerated vesting due to severance arrangements.\nThe Performance LTIP Units that were allocated during the year ended December 31, 2015 are market based awards with a service condition. Recipients could have earned between 0% -100% of the award based on the Company's achievement of absolute and relative (versus the MSCI REIT Index) total shareholder return (\"TSR\") goals, with 40% of the Performance LTIP Units available to be earned with respect to each performance period based on achievement of absolute TSR goals, and 60% of the Performance LTIP Units available to be earned with respect to each performance period based on achievement of relative TSR goals. The Performance LTIP Units issued during 2015 relate to the following performance periods: from the beginning of the service period to (i) December 31, 2016 (\"2015-First Special PP\"), (ii) December 31, 2017 (\"2015-Second Special PP\"), and (iii) December 31, 2018 (\"2015-Third Special PP\"). There was no award for the 2015-First Special PP, 2015-Second Special PP, or 2015-Third Special PP since our TSR was below the threshold level during 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nAnnual Long-Term Incentive Awards\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company approved the terms and conditions of the 2018 and 2017 annual awards (the \"2018 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\" and \"2017 Long-Term Incentive Awards,\" respectively) for certain executive officers and employees of the Company. Under the terms of the awards program, each participant is provided the opportunity to receive (i) time-based RSUs and (ii) performance-based stock units (\"PSUs\"). RSUs represent a contingent right to receive one WPG Inc. common share for each vested RSU. RSUs will vest in one-third installments on each annual anniversary of the respective Grant Date (as referenced below), subject to the participant's continued employment with the Company through each vesting date and the participant's continued compliance with certain applicable covenants. During the service period, dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to the RSUs corresponding to the amount of any dividends paid by the Company to the Company's common shareholders for the applicable dividend payment dates. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting term, except in instances that result in accelerated vesting due to severance arrangements. Actual PSUs earned may range from 0%-150% of the PSUs allocated to the award recipient, based on the Company's TSR compared to a peer group based on companies with similar assets and revenue over a three-year performance period that commenced on the respective Grant Date (as referenced below). During the performance period, dividend equivalents corresponding to the amount of any regular cash dividends paid by the Company to the Company's common shareholders for the applicable dividend payment dates will accrue and be deemed reinvested in additional PSUs, which will be settled in common shares at the same time and only to the extent that the underlying PSU is earned and settled in common shares. Payout of the PSUs is also subject to the participant's continued employment with the Company through the end of the performance period. The PSUs were valued through the use of a Monte Carlo model and the related compensation expense is recognized over the three-year performance period, except in instances that result in accelerated amortization due to severance arrangements.\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of the 2018 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards and 2017 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards, respectively:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant Date\n</td> <td>February 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 21, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RSUs issued\n</td> <td>587,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,198\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant date fair value per unit\n</td> <td>$6.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$9.58\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSUs issued\n</td> <td>587,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,198\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grant date fair value per unit\n</td> <td>$4.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7.72\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, the Company approved the performance criteria and maximum dollar amount of the 2016 annual awards (the \"2016 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\"), that generally range from 30%-100% of actual base salary, for certain executive officers and employees of the Company. The number of awards was determined by converting the cash value of the award to a number of RSUs (the \"Allocated RSUs\") based on the closing price of WPG Inc.'s common shares for the final 15 trading days of 2016. Eventual recipients were eligible to receive a percentage of the Allocated RSUs based on the Company's performance on its strategic goals detailed in the Company's 2016 cash bonus plan and the Company's relative TSR compared to a peer group based on companies with similar assets and revenue. Payout for 50% of the Allocated RSUs was based on the Company's performance on the strategic goals and the payout on the remaining 50% was based on the Company's TSR performance. Both the strategic goal component as well as the TSR performance were achieved at target, resulting in a 100% payout. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company awarded 324,237 Allocated RSUs, with a grant date fair value of $2.2 million, related to the 2016 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards, which will vest in one-third installments on each of February 21, 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to the participant's continued employment with the Company through each vesting date and the participant's continued compliance with certain applicable covenants.\nDuring 2015, the Company approved the performance criteria and maximum dollar amount of the 2015 annual LTIP unit awards (the \"2015 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\"), that generally range from 30%-300% of actual base salary earnings, for certain executive officers and employees of the Company. The number of awards was determined by converting the cash value of the award to a number of LTIP units (the \"Allocated Units\") based on the closing price of WPG Inc.'s common shares for the final 15 trading days of 2015. Eventual recipients were eligible to receive a percentage of the Allocated Units based on the Company's performance on its strategic goals detailed in the Company's 2015 cash bonus plan and the Company's relative TSR compared to the MSCI REIT Index. Payout for 40% of the Allocated Units was based on the Company's performance on the strategic goals and the payout on the remaining 60% was based on the Company's TSR performance. The strategic goal component was achieved in 2015; however, the TSR was below threshold performance, resulting in only a 40% payout for this annual LTIP award. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company awarded 323,417 LTIP units related to the 2015 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards, of which 108,118 vest in one-third installments on each of January 1, 2017, 2018 and 2019, subject to the participant's continued employment with the Company through each vesting date and the participant's continued compliance with certain applicable covenants. The 94,106 LTIP units awarded to our former Executive Chairman fully vested on the grant date and the 121,193 LTIP units awarded to certain former executive officers fully vested on the applicable severance dates during 2016 pursuant to the underlying severance arrangements. The fair value of the portion of the awards based upon the Company's performance of the strategic goals was recognized to expense when granted.\nWPG Restricted Share Awards\nThe WPG Restricted Shares relate to unvested restricted shares held by certain GRT executive employees at the time of the Merger. The amount of compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares that we expect to recognize in future periods is $33,000 over a weighted average period of 0.3 years. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the aggregate intrinsic value of shares that vested was $43,900. As of December 31, 2018, 9,033 WPG Restricted Shares were outstanding.\nWPG Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nThe Company issues RSUs to certain executive officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Board of Directors (see \"Board of Directors Compensation\" for discussion regarding RSUs issued to non-employee directors). The RSUs are service-based awards and the related fair value is expensed over the applicable service periods, except in instances that result in accelerated vesting due to severance arrangements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued 673,792 RSUs under the Plan with a fair value of $4.2 million, of which 587,000 RSUs with a fair value of $3.6 million relates to the annual long-term incentive award issuances that occurred in February 2018 (see \"Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards\" section above). As of December 31, 2018, 1,430,665 unvested RSUs were outstanding. The amount of compensation related to the unvested RSUs that we expect to recognize in future periods is $6.2 million over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\nBoard of Directors Compensation\nOn May 18, 2018, the Board approved annual compensation for the period of May 29, 2018 through May 28, 2019 for the non-employee members of the Board. Each non-employee director's annual compensation (other than the Board Chairman who receives annual compensation of $450,000) totaled $230,000 based on a combination of cash and RSUs granted under the Plan. During 2018, the six non-employee directors were granted RSUs for 138,648 shares with an aggregate grant date fair value of $940,000, which is being recognized as expense over the vesting period ending on May 28, 2019.\nStock Options\nOptions granted under the Company's Plan generally vest over a three year period, with options exercisable at a rate of 33.3% per annum beginning with the first anniversary on the date of the grant. These options were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the expenses associated with these options are amortized over the requisite vesting period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, no stock options were granted from the Plan to employees, no stock options were exercised by employees and 114,273 stock options were canceled, forfeited or expired. As of December 31, 2018, there were 679,741 stock options outstanding.\nShare Award Related Compensation Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded share award related compensation expense pertaining to the award and option plans noted above within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as indicated below (dollars in millions):\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger, restructuring and transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative and property operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Board declared common share/unit dividends of $1.00 per common share/unit.\nOn February 12, 2019, the Board declared common share/unit dividends of $0.25 per common share/unit. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2019 to shareholders/unitholders of record on March 4, 2019.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nBuy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our shareholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.\nAcquisitions. We pursue the acquisition of properties that meet our strategic criteria.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall for $58.0 million (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Southgate Mall\").\nOn April 11, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of four Sears anchor parcels and related outparcels for $28.5 million (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Sears Parcel Acquisitions\").\nOn March 2, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I completed the acquisition of Pearlridge Uptown II (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - The O'Connor Joint Ventures\").\nDispositions.

The net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Sears parcels on April 11, 2018 and for general corporate purposes.\nIn connection with the 2018 sales noted above, the Company recorded a net gain of $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is included in gain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn November 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Colonial Park Mall to an unaffiliated private real estate investor for a purchase price of $15.0 million.

We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. Our share of development costs for calendar year 2018 related to these activities was approximately $117 million. Our estimated stabilized return or yield, on invested capital typically ranges between 8% and 11%.\nWe have identified 28 department stores (currently vacant or anticipated vacancies) in our portfolio that we plan to redevelop and we are actively working on repositioning 24 of the locations. These department stores represent an opportunity to enhance the experience at the property by bringing in offerings such as dining, grocery, entertainment, home furnishings, mixed-use components as well as dynamic retail offerings. These stores are in our Tier 1 and open air properties and exclude department stores that are owned by third parties, such as Seritage. We project that we will invest between $300 million to $350 million over the next three to five years to complete the redevelopment of these department stores.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we held our grand opening of our new approximately 400,000 square foot shopping center in the Houston metropolitan area, Fairfield Town Center. The project features retailers such as H-E-B, Academy Sports, Marshall's, Party City, Old Navy, and Ulta Cosmetics. In addition, a number of dining options are at the center such as Chipotle, PeiWei, Whataburger, and Zoe's Kitchen. The project is 100% leased as of December 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, we approved the final phase of this new development for an additional investment of approximately $28 million, which will add an additional 130,000 square feet of new GLA to accommodate the strong demand at the project. Leasing for this new phase is over 50% committed for small shops and we have executed deals with a national theater and a national value fashion apparel retailer, and are finalizing a deal with an additional big box user.\nAt Scottsdale Quarter in Scottsdale, Arizona, our most recent redevelopment effort involves the final phase of the significant expansion of our initial development of the project. The first part of the expansion has been completed and consists of buildings on the north and south parcels with tenancy including American Girl and Design Within Reach, as well as luxury apartment homes and office space. The final component of the expansion will be comprised of approximately 300 new luxury apartment homes and 30,000 to 35,000 square feet of new street-level retail. The street-level retail and luxury apartment homes will have substantial amenities, such as new on-site parking and roof-top terraces overlooking Scottsdale Quarter and the McDowell Mountains. On February 7, 2018, the rights to construct the luxury apartment homes on the land of this final component were sold to an unrelated third party for $12.5 million and construction has since commenced. The interest in the retail unit of the planned development was retained. Tenants are expected to begin opening in this final component in 2019.\nAt Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, we commenced redevelopment of a former Dillard's Men's Store. Dillard's made the decision earlier in 2017 to consolidate its department stores at Great Lakes Mall into a single renovated anchor space. Round 1 Entertainment anchors the redevelopment and opened on March 30, 2018. Additional dining options, including Outback Steakhouse, which opened in December 2018, and new retailers are expected to open in early 2019. In addition, an outparcel building will be redeveloped to add a new Hobby Lobby store. We will invest approximately $15 million in this redevelopment with an expected yield of 7% - 9%.\nAt Cottonwood Mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we acquired the former Macy's store for a planned redevelopment at the property. We plan to replace the former department store with two home furnishings stores, Mor Furniture for Less and Homelife Furniture, which opened in December 2018, as well as a new Hobby Lobby store, which opened in November 2018. We will invest between $20 million and $22 million in this redevelopment with an expected yield of 6% - 7%.\nAt Grand Central Mall in Parkersburg, West Virginia, we replaced an Elder-Beerman with a new 20,000 square foot H&M store, their first store in West Virginia, which opened in October 2018. Additionally, we added a new Five Below and Ulta Beauty, which opened in September 2018, in the former hhgregg store, and we are adding a Big Lots in the former Toys R Us location. Lastly, we have finalized our redevelopment plans for the former Sears space which will add an exciting exterior facing element to the center featuring dynamic first-to-market retailers. This new lifestyle component will complete the transformation of Grand Central Mall from a traditional enclosed regional center into a hybrid town center. We will invest between $31 million and $33 million in this redevelopment with an expected yield of 6% - 8%.\nAt Dayton Mall in Dayton, Ohio, we have signed leases with Ross Dress for Less and The RoomPlace to enhance the retail offering at the property. Ross Dress for Less will replace a former hhgregg store and The RoomPlace will be located in a newly combined larger store from previous small shop space. The estimated investment in adding these two retailers to the property will be between $8 million and $10 million with an anticipated yield of 10% - 12%.\nAt Lincolnwood Town Center in Lincolnwood, Illinois, we have a signed lease with The RoomPlace to take approximately two thirds of the recently vacated Carson Pirie Scott department store. The estimated investment in the redevelopment will be between $16 million and $18 million and the yield is anticipated to be 7% - 8%.\nOn April 11, 2018 we acquired, through a sale-leaseback transaction, four Sears department stores and adjacent Sears Auto Centers located at Longview Mall; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae; Southern Hills Mall; and Town Center at Aurora. The purchase price was approximately $28.5 million and was funded by a combination of the Section 1031 tax proceeds from the Four Corners transaction, contributions from our joint venture partner related to their pro-rata share of the joint venture that owns Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae and availability on our Facility. We have control of these stores for future redevelopment and Sears, subject to their bankruptcy proceedings, will continue to operate under new leases.\nIn addition to the purchase of four Sears stores discussed above, we also proactively negotiated early termination of Sears leases to gain control of the real estate and commence redevelopment efforts at four of our Tier One assets. The first lease relates to the Sears store at Grand Central Mall, which closed in December 2018, and the redevelopment of the property is discussed above. The second lease relates to the Sears store at Southern Park Mall in Youngstown, Ohio which closed during the third quarter of 2018. We are in discussions with new tenants for the high visibility anchor space. The third lease relates to the Sears store at The Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek, Ohio, which closed in December 2018. We will be adding The RoomPlace and Round 1 Entertainment, both first to market. The RoomPlace will replace the upper level of Sears and complement the hybrid town center format with dynamic retail, dining and entertainment options. Round 1 Entertainment will replace the lower level of Sears. Both The RoomPlace and Round 1 Entertainment are expected to open in late 2019. The fourth lease relates to the Sears store at WestShore Plaza in Tampa, Florida which will terminate at the end of the first quarter of 2019, and we are currently in the entitlement process. We are actively working on redevelopment plans, and additional details will be announced in the future.\nAt The Outlet Collection\u00ae | Seattle, we have plans to add a FieldhouseUSA to the property in a former Sam's Club store. FieldhouseUSA specializes in sporting leagues, events and tournaments by offering year-round league and tournament play in team sports such as basketball, soccer, volleyball and flag football in addition to programs such as birthday parties, corporate events, performance training and skills training. This use will greatly complement the recently added Dave & Buster's at the property and we anticipate announcing further details about this exciting redevelopment in the near future. The estimated investment in the redevelopment will be between $11 million and $13 million and the yield is anticipated to be 9% - 10%.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes total consolidated capital expenditures on a cash basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New developments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redevelopments and expansions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant allowances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes capitalized interest, wages and real estate taxes, as well as expenditures for certain equipment and fixtures, commissions, and project costs, which are included in capital expenditures, net on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Such factors include, but are not limited to: changes in asset quality and credit risk; ability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in political, economic or market conditions generally and the real estate and capital markets specifically; the impact of increased competition; the availability of capital and financing; tenant or joint venture partner(s) bankruptcies; the failure to increase enclosed retail store occupancy and same-store operating income; risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties; changes in market rental rates; trends in the retail industry; relationships with anchor tenants; risks relating to joint venture properties; costs of common area maintenance; competitive market forces; the level and volatility of interest rates; the rate of revenue increases as compared to expense increases; the financial stability of tenants within the retail industry; the restrictions in current financing arrangements or the failure to comply with such arrangements; the liquidity of real estate investments; the impact of changes to tax legislation and our tax positions; failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust; the failure to refinance debt at favorable terms and conditions; loss of key personnel; material changes in the dividend rates on securities or the ability to pay dividends on common shares or other securities; possible restrictions on the ability to operate or dispose of any partially-owned properties; the failure to achieve earnings/funds from operations targets or estimates; the failure to achieve projected returns or yields on development and investment properties (including joint ventures); expected gains on debt extinguishment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations thereof; terrorist activities and international hostilities; the unfavorable resolution of legal or regulatory proceedings; the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; assets that may be subject to impairment charges; and significant costs related to environmental issues. We discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and statements filed by WPG Inc. and WPG L.P. with the SEC. We undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIndustry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on FFO, NOI and comparable NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for our comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.\nWe determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income computed in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excluding gains and losses upon acquisition of controlling interests in properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate.\nYou should understand that our computation of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following schedule reconciles total FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except share/unit and per share/unit amounts):\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>

partnership decreased $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $8.0 million less in FFO related to properties that were disposed of during the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. We also received $6.9 million less in FFO from properties that are now held as joint ventures. The majority of this variance can be attributed to properties that were transferred to the O'Connor Joint Venture II during the second quarter of 2017. Interest expense increased by $15.4 million of which the majority of this increase can be attributed to additional interest expense incurred on our corporate bonds. Additionally, we received $18.6 million less in comparable NOI from comparable properties. Of this decrease, $8.0 million is related to co-tenancy and lost rents associated with anchor bankruptcies, an additional $1.3 million relates to tenant reimbursement revenue decreases related to capital projects, and $5.9 million in additional property operating expenses which were primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs. Lastly, we experienced a decrease of FFO related to the gain on extinguishment of debt, net of $39.2 million. During 2017 we recognized $90.6 million in gain, related to three following transactions: $21.2 million gain related to the discounted payoff of the $87.3 million mortgage loan secured by Mesa Mall, a $41.6 million gain related to the discounted payoff of the $99.7 million mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall; and a $27.8 million gain related to the transition of Valle Vista Mall to the mortgage lender pursuant to the terms of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreement entered into by an affiliate of WPG Inc. and the mortgage lender concerning the $40.0 million mortgage loan. During 2018 we recorded a $51.4 million gain related to the transition of Rushmore Mall to the mortgage lender pursuant to the term of a deed-in-lieu of foreclose agreement entered into by an affiliate of WPG Inc. and the mortgage lender concerning the $94.0 million mortgage loan. Offsetting these decreases was $21.6 million in additional FFO received from the sale of outparcels primarily related to the sale to Four Corners (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Outparcel Sale\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe deem NOI and comparable NOI to be important measures for investors and management to use in assessing our operating performance, as these measures enable us to present the core operating results from our portfolio, excluding certain non-cash, corporate-level and nonrecurring items.

The enclosed retail property contains approximately 631,000 square feet of GLA and is anchored by a recently constructed AMC Theater, a new Lucky's Market grocer that replaced a portion of a former Sears, J.C. Penney (non-owned) and Dillard's (non-owned) and is the dominant retail center in this secondary market, with no competitive destination retail property located within 130 miles.\nOn September 27, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. closed on a $35.0 million full-recourse mortgage note payable with a three-year term and a fixed rate of 4.48% secured by Southgate Mall. The mortgage note payable requires interest only payments and will initially mature on September 27, 2021, subject to two one-year extensions available at our option subject to compliance with the terms of the underlying loan agreement and payment of customary extension fees. The proceeds were used to reduce corporate debt and for ongoing redevelopment efforts.\nSears Parcel Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2018, we acquired, through a sale-leaseback transaction, four Sears department stores and adjacent Sears Auto Centers at Longview Mall, located in Longview, Texas; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae, located in Columbus, Ohio; Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa; and Town Center at Aurora, located in Aurora, Colorado. The purchase price was approximately $28.5 million and was funded by a combination of $13.4 million from our Facility, $9.7 million from the first tranche of the Four Corners transaction, as discussed in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Outparcel Sale,\" and $5.4 million from our joint venture partner related to their pro-rata share of the joint venture that owns Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae. We have control of these stores for future redevelopment and Sears, depending on the outcome of their bankruptcy proceedings, will continue to operate under new leases, providing aggregate minimum rent under these leases of approximately $1.25 million per annum. In addition, under the terms of these leases, Sears is responsible for paying common area maintenance charges, taxes, insurance and utilities while they operate the stores. Other than the store at Town Center at Aurora, Sears has announced plans to close the remaining three stores in the first quarter of 2019.\nSears Bankruptcy\nOn October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and announced additional store closings. As of December 31, 2018, we had 35 Sears stores totaling approximately 4.9 million square feet of GLA within the portfolio of properties we manage, which were responsible for approximately 0.8% of our total annualized base minimum rents. We own 17 of the stores, Sears owns eight stores and third parties (including Seritage Growth Properties) own 10 stores. Sears has announced plans to close a number of stores during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, Sears has entered into an asset purchase agreement which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court\u201d) on February 8, 2019. Certain of our leases may be assumed and assigned as part of the asset purchase transaction, while other stores may be closed as part of Sears' ongoing store closings. After the announced closures, we expect to have 10 Sears stores operating in our portfolio, subject to the outcome of the ongoing proceedings. In addition to the risk of lost base minimum rent from Sears, co-tenancy clauses in leases for in-line retailers may trigger as a result of Sears store closures, and losses could be significant. We considered the impact of the bankruptcy announcement in our evaluation of impairment, including announced closures, noting no impairment charges were warranted as of December 31, 2018. We are in various stages of redevelopment for many of these stores (see details under \"Development Activity\").\nOutparcel Sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of various tranches of restaurant outparcels to FCPT Acquisitions, LLC (\"Four Corners\") pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement executed on September 20, 2017 between the Company and Four Corners.\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of each tranche (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe Company used the proceeds to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Sears parcels on April 11, 2018 as discussed above, to reduce corporate debt, and to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts. On January 18, 2019, we completed the sixth tranche of restaurant outparcels. This tranche consisted of eight restaurant outparcels. Additionally on February 11, 2019, we closed on the sale of one additional restaurant outparcel. The allocated purchase price was approximately $12.2 million, and the net proceeds of approximately $12.1 million were used to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts and for general corporate purposes. The Company expects to close on the remaining 15 outparcels for approximately $25.3 million during the first half of 2019, subject to due diligence and closing conditions.\nThe O'Connor Joint Ventures\nThe Company has two joint ventures with O'Connor Mall Partners, L.P. (\"O'Connor\").\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture I\nThis investment consists of a 51% noncontrolling interest held by the Company in a portfolio of five enclosed retail properties and related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Mall at Johnson City located in Johnson City, Tennessee; Pearlridge Center located in Aiea, Hawaii; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae; Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae located in Scottsdale, Arizona; and Town Center Plaza (which consists of Town Center Plaza and the adjacent Town Center Crossing) located in Leawood, Kansas. We retain management, leasing, and development responsibilities for the O'Connor Joint Venture I.\nOn April 11, 2018, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on the acquisition of the Sears department store located at Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae in connection with our acquisition of additional Sears department stores (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Sears Parcel Acquisitions\").\nOn March 2, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I acquired an additional section at Pearlridge Center for a gross purchase price of $70.0 million. Pearlridge Center is currently comprised of two distinct enclosed venues commonly referred to as Uptown and Downtown. The acquired section consists of approximately 153,000 square feet, which is part of Uptown (and referenced herein as Pearlridge Uptown II), and is anchored by Ross Dress for Less and TJ Maxx. Subsequent to the purchase, the joint venture placed secured debt on the property (see below for details). Our share of the purchase price was funded by a combination of our share of the secured debt and availability on our credit facility.\nOn March 30, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $43.2 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with an eight year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.071% secured by Pearlridge Uptown II. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until April 1, 2019, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $22.0 million.\nOn March 29, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $55.0 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with a ten year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.36% secured by sections of Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae known as Block K and Block M. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until May 1, 2022, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $28.1 million.\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture II\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed an additional joint venture transaction with O'Connor with respect to the ownership and operation of seven of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Arboretum, located in Austin, Texas; Arbor Hills, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Classen Curve and The Triangle at Classen Curve, each located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills Plaza, located in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma (the \"Oklahoma City Properties,\" collectively); Gateway Centers, located in Austin, Texas; Malibu Lumber Yard, located in Malibu, California; Palms Crossing I and II, located in McAllen, Texas and The Shops at Arbor Walk, located in Austin, Texas (the \"O'Connor Joint Venture II\"). The transaction valued the properties at $598.6 million before closing adjustments and debt assumptions.\nUnder the terms of the joint venture agreement, we retained a non-controlling 51% interest in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and sold the remaining 49% to O'Connor. The transaction generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $138.9 million, after taking into consideration costs associated with the transaction and the assumption of debt (including the new mortgage loans on The Arboretum, Gateway Centers, and Oklahoma City Properties which closed prior to the joint venture transaction; see \"Financing & Debt\" below for net proceeds to the Company from the new mortgage loans), which we used to reduce the Company's debt as well as for general corporate purposes. At the time of closing, we deconsolidated the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and recorded a gain in connection with this partial sale of $126.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The gain was recorded pursuant to ASC 360-20 and calculated based upon proceeds received, less 49% of the book value of the deconsolidated net assets. Our retained 51% non-controlling equity method interest was valued at historical cost based upon the pro rata book value of the retained interest in the net assets. We retain management and leasing responsibilities for the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II. In connection with the formation of this joint venture, we recorded transaction costs of approximately $6.4 million as part of our basis in this investment.\nImpairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, a major anchor tenant of Rushmore Mall, located in Rapid City, South Dakota, informed us of their intention to close their store at the property. The impending closure was deemed a triggering event and, therefore, we evaluated this property in conjunction with our quarterly impairment review and preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We compared the estimated fair value of $37.5 million to the related carrying value of $75.0 million, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $37.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn October 4, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell Colonial Park Mall, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to an unaffiliated private real estate investor, which was sold on November 3, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, we shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for this asset, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. We compared the fair value measurement of the property to its relative carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $20.9 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of Morgantown Commons, located in Morgantown, West Virginia, which was sold in the second quarter of 2017. We shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for the asset during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. The purchase offer represented the best available evidence of fair value for this property. We compared the fair value to the carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $8.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $21.9 million primarily related to noncore properties consisting of Gulf View Square, located in Port Richey, Florida; Richmond Town Square, located in Cleveland, Ohio; River Oaks Center, located in Chicago, Illinois; and Virginia Center Commons, located in Glen Allen, Virginia. The impairment charge was attributed to the continued declines in the fair value of the properties and executed agreements entered into in 2016 to sell these properties at prices below the carrying value. Each of the aforementioned noncore properties has been sold in accordance with the Company's strategic objectives.\nHurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma made landfall in Houston, Texas and Southern Florida, respectively. The Company had 15 assets experience damage attributed to the hurricanes, but no asset sustained catastrophic damage nor was there any loss of life. Further, no asset experienced a significant loss of business or functionality. The Company recognized approximately $900,000 of expense attributed to the damage, repairs and asset write-offs, which was below insurance deductible thresholds.\nBusiness Opportunities\nWe derive our revenues primarily from retail tenant leases, including fixed minimum rent leases, percentage rent leases based on tenants' sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses. We seek to re-lease our spaces at higher rents and increase our occupancy rates, and to enhance the performance of our properties and increase our revenues by, among other things, adding or replacing anchors or big-box tenants, re-developing or renovating existing properties to increase the leasable square footage, and increasing the productivity of occupied locations through aesthetic upgrades, re-merchandising and/or changes to the retail use of the space. We seek growth in earnings, FFO and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments.\nAdditionally, we feel there are opportunities to enhance our portfolio and balance sheet through active portfolio management. We believe that there are opportunities for us to acquire additional shopping centers that match our investment and strategic criteria. We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We also seek to dispose of or contribute to a joint venture assets that no longer meet our strategic criteria. These dispositions will be a combination of asset sales and transitions of over-levered properties to lenders or special servicers.\nWe consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable NOI (NOI for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this report.\nPortfolio Data\nThe portfolio data discussed in this overview includes key operating statistics for the Company including ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot and comparable NOI for the core properties owned at December 31, 2018. Towne West Square, located in Wichita, Kansas, and West Ridge Mall, located in Topeka, Kansas were identified as noncore properties.\nCore business fundamentals in the overall portfolio during 2018 were generally stable compared to 2017. Ending occupancy for the core portfolio was 93.9% as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 93.5% as of December 31, 2017. Average base minimum rent per square foot for the core portfolio decreased by 0.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. Comparable NOI decreased 3.0% for the core portfolio when comparing calendar year 2018 to 2017. Our core enclosed retail properties had a decrease in comparable NOI of 3.5%, which was driven primarily by the impact of 2018 department store bankruptcies filed and related co-tenancy impact. The core open air properties had a comparable NOI decrease of 1.7% in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily related to the Toys R Us bankruptcy and lower CAM capital spending in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth key operating statistics for the combined portfolio of core properties or interests in properties:\n\n (1) Ending occupancy is the percentage of GLA which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all Company-owned space except for anchors, majors, office and outlots at our enclosed retail properties in the calculation of ending occupancy. Open air property GLA included in the calculation relates to all Company-owned space other than office space. \n (2) Average base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  Current Leasing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we signed new leases and renewal leases with terms in excess of a year (excluding enclosed retail property anchors, majors, offices and in-line spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet) across the core portfolio, comprising approximately 2,188,100 square feet. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $23.82 per square foot (\"psf\") and for renewed leases was $26.87 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $31.54 psf for new leases and $5.23 psf for renewals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we signed new leases and renewal leases with terms in excess of a year (excluding enclosed retail property anchors, majors, offices and in-line spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet) across the comparable core portfolio, comprising approximately 2,497,800 square feet. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $24.78 psf and for renewed leases was $25.26 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $36.05 psf for new leases and $3.40 psf for renewals.\nPortfolio Summary\nWe have provided some of our key operating metrics for our core enclosed retail property portfolio in different tiers. The purpose of the disclosure is to provide some distinction between the characteristics of the core enclosed retail properties. Tier 1 enclosed retail properties generally have higher occupancy, sales productivity and growth profiles, while Tier 2 enclosed retail properties are viable enclosed retail properties with lower productivity and modest growth profiles.\nThe table below provides some of our key metrics for the core enclosed retail property tiers as well as some key metrics for our open air property portfolio:\n\n1Metrics only include properties owned as of December 31, 2018.\nEnclosed Retail Property Tiers\nThe following table categorizes the enclosed retail properties into the respective tiers as of December 31, 2018:\n\n1Property has been identified to change tiers in 2019.\n2Reclassified as noncore properties in 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We generally accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Many of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold as defined in their lease. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. \n \u2022 We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, ending occupancy, estimated market values or our decision to dispose of a property before the end of its estimated useful life. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, irrespective of changes in circumstances. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to expense the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, leasing prospects and local market information. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results. \n \u2022 To maintain its status as a REIT, WPG Inc. must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact WPG Inc.'s REIT status. In the unlikely event that WPG Inc. fails to maintain REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then it would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period it did not qualify as a REIT. If WPG Inc. lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods. \n \u2022 We make estimates as part of our recording of property acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the recording of the fair value of buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the recording of the fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as tenant sales, rents per square foot, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases. \n \u2022 A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of professional judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed when it is held available for occupancy, and accordingly, cease capitalization of costs upon opening. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAdoption of New Standards\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" using the modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014-09 revised GAAP by offering a single comprehensive revenue recognition standard instead of numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions. The impacted revenue streams primarily consist of fees earned from management, development and leasing services provided to joint ventures in which we own an interest and other ancillary income earned from our properties. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase equity of approximately $2.5 million related to changes in the revenue recognition pattern of lease commissions earned by the Company from our joint ventures. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nAdditionally, we adopted the clarified scope guidance of ASC 610-20, \"Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\" in conjunction with ASU 2014-09, using the modified retrospective approach. ASC 610-20 applies to the sale, transfer and derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales, and eliminates the guidance specific to real estate in ASC 360-20. With respect to full disposals, the recognition will generally be consistent with our current measurement and pattern of recognition. With respect to partial sales of real estate to joint ventures, the new guidance requires us to recognize a full gain where an equity investment is retained. These transactions could result in a basis difference as we will be required to measure our retained equity interest at fair value, whereas the joint venture may continue to measure the assets received at carryover basis. No adjustments were required upon adoption of this standard.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\" ASU 2017-12 aims to reduce complexity in cash value hedges of interest rate risk and eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, generally requiring the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.6 million between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\" and ASU 2016-18 \"Restricted Cash\" using a retrospective transition approach, which changed our statements of cash flows and related disclosures for all periods presented. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows and its adoption had no impact on our financial statements. ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2017, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.9 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $6.4 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $1.7 million were reclassified. For the year ended December 31, 2016, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $0.8 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $1.5 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $10.4 million were reclassified. Restricted cash primarily relates to cash held in escrow for payment of real estate taxes and property reserves for maintenance, expansion or leasehold improvements as required by our mortgage loans. Restricted cash is included in \"Deferred costs and other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nNew Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.\nIn July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment that provides an entity the optional transition method to initially account for the impact of the adoption ASU 2016-02 with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019 (the effective date of the ASU), rather than January 1, 2017, which would eliminate the need to restate amounts presented prior to January 1, 2019. We will utilize this optional transition method. From a lessee perspective, the Company currently has four material ground leases, two material office leases, and one material garage lease that, under the new guidance, will result in the recognition of a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. As of December 31, 2018, undiscounted future minimum lease payments due under these leases total approximately $31.1 million with termination dates which range from 2023 to 2076 and we expect the recognized lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset to not exceed $20.0 million upon adoption.\nFrom a lessor perspective, the new guidance remains mostly similar to current rules, though contract consideration will now be allocated between lease and non-lease components. Non-lease component allocations will be recognized under ASU 2014-09, and we expect that this will result in a different pattern of recognition for certain non-lease components, including for fixed common-area (\"CAM\") revenues.\nHowever, the FASB's amendment to ASU 2016-02 referred to above allows lessors to elect, as a practical expedient, not to allocate the total consideration to lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone selling prices. This practical expedient allows lessors to elect a combined single lease component presentation if (i) the timing and pattern of the revenue recognition of the combined single lease component is the same, and (ii) the combined single component would be classified as an operating lease. We believe we meet the criteria to use this practical expedient and we plan to elect this practical expedient upon the effective date. In addition, ASU 2016-02 limits the capitalization of leasing costs to initial direct costs, which will likely result in a reduction to our capitalized leasing costs and an increase to general and administrative expenses, though the amount of such changes is highly dependent upon the leasing compensation structures in place at the time of adoption. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company deferred $17.7 million and $16.9 million of internal leasing costs, respectively. From a lessor perspective, other than the reduction to capitalized leasing costs and increase to general and administrative expenses related to internal leasing costs based on the Company's current leasing compensation structure, which is not expected to change significantly upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \"Fair Value Measurements (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements.\" ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures, modifies certain disclosures, and adds additional disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following acquisitions and dispositions affected our results in the comparative periods:\n\u2022On November 16, 2018, we completed the sale of the fifth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 31, 2018, we completed the sale of the fourth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 23, 2018, we transitioned Rushmore Mall to the lender.\n\u2022On July 27, 2018, we completed the sale of the third tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On June 29, 2018, we completed the sale of the second tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On April 24, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall.\n\u2022On April 11, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of four Sears department stores located at Longview Mall, Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae (unconsolidated), Southern Hills Mall, and Town Center at Aurora.\n\u2022On January 12, 2018, we completed the sale of the first tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On November 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Colonial Park Mall.\n\u2022On October 17, 2017, we completed a discounted payoff of the mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\u2022On October 3, 2017, we transitioned Valle Vista Mall, located in Harlingen, Texas, to the lender.\n\u2022On June 13, 2017, we sold 49% of our interest in Malibu Lumber Yard as part of the O'Connor Joint Venture II transaction.\n\u2022On June 7, 2017, we completed the sale of Morgantown Commons.\n\u2022On May 16, 2017, we completed the sale of an 80,000 square foot vacant anchor parcel at Indian Mound Mall, located in Heath, Ohio.\n\u2022On May 12, 2017, we completed the transaction forming the O'Connor Joint Venture II with regard to the ownership and operation of six of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels.

Our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow and borrowings under our debt arrangements, including our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or \"Revolver\", unsecured notes payable and senior unsecured term loans as further discussed below.\nWe derive most of our liquidity from leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations, the total of which was $287.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased $9.5 million during 2018 to $42.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to net repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and capital expenditures, partially offset by operating cash flow from properties, net distributions from our joint ventures, and the net proceeds from the disposition of properties. See \"Cash Flows\" below for more information.\nBecause we own primarily long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies on a combination of long-term mortgage debt as well as unsecured debt supported by a quality unencumbered asset pool, providing us with ample flexibility from a liquidity perspective. Our strategy is to have the majority of our debt fixed either through fixed rate mortgages or interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate. At December 31, 2018, floating rate debt (excluding loans hedged to fixed interest) comprised 15.2% of our total consolidated debt. We will continue to monitor our borrowing mix to limit market risk.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we successfully completed the issuance of $750.0 million of unsecured notes. The notes are due on August 15, 2024 and the proceeds were used to repay the $500.0 million Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\"), with a maturity date of May 30, 2018 and $230.0 million of the June 2015 Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\") with a maturity date of March 2, 2020, respectively.\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2018, we amended and restated our Facility (as defined under \"The Facility.\"). Under the amended and restated terms, the Facility will mature in December 2022 assuming all extension options are exercised. Prior to the amendment and restatement, the Revolver matured on May 30, 2019, assuming all extension options were exercised. These transactions are reflective of our strategy to access the unsecured debt markets to extend our weighted average debt maturity.\nOn December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $359.8 million under the Revolver, net of outstanding borrowings of $290.0 million and $0.2 million reserved for outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average interest rate on the Revolver was 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, Fitch Ratings & Moody's Investor Service lowered their credit rating on WPG L.P.'s unsecured long-term indebtedness, which will increase interest rates on our Facility (as defined in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - The Facility.\"), December 2015 Term Loan, and 5.950% Notes due 2024 as of February 2, 2019. Due to the downgrade, our Revolver will bear interest at LIBOR plus 165 basis points (an increase of 40 basis points), our Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 190 basis points (an increase of 45 basis points), and our December 2015 Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 235 basis points (an increase of 55 basis points). Our 5.950% Notes due 2024 will bear interest at 6.450% (an increase of 50 basis points). Assuming the new pricing grid was effective January 1, 2018, the impact would have resulted in an increase in borrowing costs of approximately $8.5 million during 2018. Such a downgrade may also impact terms and conditions of future borrowings in addition to adversely affecting our ability to access the public markets.\nThe consolidated indebtedness of our business was approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, or an increase of approximately $39.9 million from December 31, 2017. The change in consolidated indebtedness from December 31, 2017 is described in greater detail under \"Financing and Debt.\"\nOutlook\nOur business model and WPG Inc.'s status as a REIT requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capitalized terms not defined in this Item 7 shall have the definitions ascribed to those terms in Items 1-6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview-Basis of Presentation\nWPG Inc. is an Indiana corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed REIT, under the Code. WPG Inc. will generally qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as it continues to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, and satisfy certain other requirements. WPG Inc. will generally be allowed a deduction against its U.S. federal income tax liability for dividends paid by it to REIT shareholders, thereby reducing or eliminating any corporate level taxation to WPG Inc. WPG L.P. is WPG Inc.'s majority-owned limited partnership subsidiary that owns, develops and manages, through its affiliates, all of WPG Inc.'s real estate properties and other assets. WPG Inc. is the sole general partner of WPG L.P. On May 28, 2014, WPG separated from SPG through the distribution of 100% of the outstanding units of WPG L.P. to the owners of SPG L.P. and 100% of the outstanding shares of WPG Inc. to the SPG common shareholders in a tax-free distribution. Prior to the separation, WPG Inc. and WPG L.P. were wholly owned subsidiaries of the SPG Businesses. On January 15, 2015, the Company acquired Glimcher Realty Trust in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. As of December 31, 2018, our assets consisted of material interests in 108 shopping centers in the United States, consisting of open air properties and enclosed retail properties, comprised of approximately 58 million square feet of managed GLA.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include the accounts of WPG Inc. and WPG L.P., as well as their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated statements of operations include the consolidated accounts of the Company. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nLeadership Changes and Severance Impacting Financial Results\n2019 Activity\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company's Executive Vice President, Head of Open Air Centers, was terminated without cause from his position and received severance payments and other benefits pursuant to the terms and conditions of his employment agreement. In addition, the Company terminated, without cause, additional non-executive personnel in the Property Management department as part of an effort to reduce overhead costs. The Company expects to record aggregate severance charges of approximately $1.9 million, including $0.1 million of non-cash stock compensation in the form of accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards.\n2018 Activity\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company's Executive Vice President, Property Management was terminated without cause from his position and received severance payments and other benefits pursuant to the terms and conditions of his employment agreement. In addition, the Company terminated without cause additional non-executive personnel in the Property Management department. In connection with and as part of the aforementioned management and personnel changes, the Company recorded aggregate severance charges of $2.0 million, including $0.5 million of non-cash stock compensation in the form of accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards, which costs are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2016 Activity\nOn June 20, 2016, the Company announced the following leadership changes: (1) the resignation of Mr. Michael P. Glimcher as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board; (2) the appointment of Mr. Louis G. Conforti, a current Board member, as Interim Chief Executive Officer; (3) the resignation of Mr. Mark S. Ordan as non-executive Chairman of the Board; and (4) the resignation of Mr. Niles C. Overly from the Board. In July of 2016, the Company terminated some additional executive and non-executive personnel as part of an effort to reduce overhead costs. On October 6, 2016, the Company announced that Mr. Conforti would serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer for a term ending December 31, 2019, subject to early termination clauses and automatic renewals pursuant to his employment agreement.\nIn connection with and as part of the aforementioned management changes, the Company recorded aggregate charges of $29.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $25.5 million related to severance and restructuring-related costs, including $9.5 million of non-cash stock compensation for accelerated vesting of equity incentive awards, and $4.1 million related to fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Company's investigation of various strategic alternatives, which costs are included in merger, restructuring and transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe Facility\nOn January 22, 2018, WPG L.P. amended and restated $1.0 billion of the existing unsecured revolving credit facility, or \"Revolver\" and unsecured term loan, or \"Term Loan\" (collectively known as the \"Facility\"). The recasted Facility can be increased to $1.5 billion through currently uncommitted Facility commitments. Excluding the accordion feature, the recasted Facility includes a $650.0 million Revolver and $350.0 million Term Loan. The interest rates for the Revolver and Term Loan remained substantially consistent with the previous terms. When considering extension options, the recasted Facility will mature on December 30, 2022. The $350.0 million Term Loan was fully funded at closing, and the Company used the proceeds to repay the $270.0 million outstanding on the June 2015 Term Loan and to pay down the Revolver.\nSouthgate Mall\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall, located in Missoula, Montana, for $58.0 million. The enclosed retail property contains approximately 631,000 square feet of GLA and is anchored by a recently constructed AMC Theater, a new Lucky's Market grocer that replaced a portion of a former Sears, J.C. Penney (non-owned) and Dillard's (non-owned) and is the dominant retail center in this secondary market, with no competitive destination retail property located within 130 miles.\nOn September 27, 2018, an affiliate of WPG Inc. closed on a $35.0 million full-recourse mortgage note payable with a three-year term and a fixed rate of 4.48% secured by Southgate Mall. The mortgage note payable requires interest only payments and will initially mature on September 27, 2021, subject to two one-year extensions available at our option subject to compliance with the terms of the underlying loan agreement and payment of customary extension fees. The proceeds were used to reduce corporate debt and for ongoing redevelopment efforts.\nSears Parcel Acquisitions\nOn April 11, 2018, we acquired, through a sale-leaseback transaction, four Sears department stores and adjacent Sears Auto Centers at Longview Mall, located in Longview, Texas; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae, located in Columbus, Ohio; Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa; and Town Center at Aurora, located in Aurora, Colorado. The purchase price was approximately $28.5 million and was funded by a combination of $13.4 million from our Facility, $9.7 million from the first tranche of the Four Corners transaction, as discussed in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Outparcel Sale,\" and $5.4 million from our joint venture partner related to their pro-rata share of the joint venture that owns Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae. We have control of these stores for future redevelopment and Sears, depending on the outcome of their bankruptcy proceedings, will continue to operate under new leases, providing aggregate minimum rent under these leases of approximately $1.25 million per annum. In addition, under the terms of these leases, Sears is responsible for paying common area maintenance charges, taxes, insurance and utilities while they operate the stores. Other than the store at Town Center at Aurora, Sears has announced plans to close the remaining three stores in the first quarter of 2019.\nSears Bankruptcy\nOn October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and announced additional store closings. As of December 31, 2018, we had 35 Sears stores totaling approximately 4.9 million square feet of GLA within the portfolio of properties we manage, which were responsible for approximately 0.8% of our total annualized base minimum rents. We own 17 of the stores, Sears owns eight stores and third parties (including Seritage Growth Properties) own 10 stores. Sears has announced plans to close a number of stores during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, Sears has entered into an asset purchase agreement which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court\u201d) on February 8, 2019. Certain of our leases may be assumed and assigned as part of the asset purchase transaction, while other stores may be closed as part of Sears' ongoing store closings. After the announced closures, we expect to have 10 Sears stores operating in our portfolio, subject to the outcome of the ongoing proceedings. In addition to the risk of lost base minimum rent from Sears, co-tenancy clauses in leases for in-line retailers may trigger as a result of Sears store closures, and losses could be significant. We considered the impact of the bankruptcy announcement in our evaluation of impairment, including announced closures, noting no impairment charges were warranted as of December 31, 2018. We are in various stages of redevelopment for many of these stores (see details under \"Development Activity\").\nOutparcel Sale\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sale of various tranches of restaurant outparcels to FCPT Acquisitions, LLC (\"Four Corners\") pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement executed on September 20, 2017 between the Company and Four Corners.\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of each tranche (dollars in thousands):\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Parcels Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 12, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 27, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tranche 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 16, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company used the proceeds to fund a portion of the acquisition of the Sears parcels on April 11, 2018 as discussed above, to reduce corporate debt, and to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts. On January 18, 2019, we completed the sixth tranche of restaurant outparcels. This tranche consisted of eight restaurant outparcels. Additionally on February 11, 2019, we closed on the sale of one additional restaurant outparcel. The allocated purchase price was approximately $12.2 million, and the net proceeds of approximately $12.1 million were used to fund ongoing redevelopment efforts and for general corporate purposes. The Company expects to close on the remaining 15 outparcels for approximately $25.3 million during the first half of 2019, subject to due diligence and closing conditions.\nThe O'Connor Joint Ventures\nThe Company has two joint ventures with O'Connor Mall Partners, L.P. (\"O'Connor\").\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture I\nThis investment consists of a 51% noncontrolling interest held by the Company in a portfolio of five enclosed retail properties and related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Mall at Johnson City located in Johnson City, Tennessee; Pearlridge Center located in Aiea, Hawaii; Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae; Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae located in Scottsdale, Arizona; and Town Center Plaza (which consists of Town Center Plaza and the adjacent Town Center Crossing) located in Leawood, Kansas. We retain management, leasing, and development responsibilities for the O'Connor Joint Venture I.\nOn April 11, 2018, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on the acquisition of the Sears department store located at Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae in connection with our acquisition of additional Sears department stores (see details under \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - Sears Parcel Acquisitions\").\nOn March 2, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I acquired an additional section at Pearlridge Center for a gross purchase price of $70.0 million. Pearlridge Center is currently comprised of two distinct enclosed venues commonly referred to as Uptown and Downtown. The acquired section consists of approximately 153,000 square feet, which is part of Uptown (and referenced herein as Pearlridge Uptown II), and is anchored by Ross Dress for Less and TJ Maxx. Subsequent to the purchase, the joint venture placed secured debt on the property (see below for details). Our share of the purchase price was funded by a combination of our share of the secured debt and availability on our credit facility.\nOn March 30, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $43.2 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with an eight year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.071% secured by Pearlridge Uptown II. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until April 1, 2019, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $22.0 million.\nOn March 29, 2017, the O'Connor Joint Venture I closed on a $55.0 million non-recourse mortgage note payable with a ten year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.36% secured by sections of Scottsdale Quarter\u00ae known as Block K and Block M. The mortgage note payable requires monthly interest only payments until May 1, 2022, at which time monthly interest and principal payments are due until maturity. Our pro-rata share of the mortgage note payable issuance is $28.1 million.\n\u2022The O'Connor Joint Venture II\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed an additional joint venture transaction with O'Connor with respect to the ownership and operation of seven of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels, consisting of the following: The Arboretum, located in Austin, Texas; Arbor Hills, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Classen Curve and The Triangle at Classen Curve, each located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills Plaza, located in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma (the \"Oklahoma City Properties,\" collectively); Gateway Centers, located in Austin, Texas; Malibu Lumber Yard, located in Malibu, California; Palms Crossing I and II, located in McAllen, Texas and The Shops at Arbor Walk, located in Austin, Texas (the \"O'Connor Joint Venture II\"). The transaction valued the properties at $598.6 million before closing adjustments and debt assumptions.\nUnder the terms of the joint venture agreement, we retained a non-controlling 51% interest in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and sold the remaining 49% to O'Connor. The transaction generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $138.9 million, after taking into consideration costs associated with the transaction and the assumption of debt (including the new mortgage loans on The Arboretum, Gateway Centers, and Oklahoma City Properties which closed prior to the joint venture transaction; see \"Financing & Debt\" below for net proceeds to the Company from the new mortgage loans), which we used to reduce the Company's debt as well as for general corporate purposes. At the time of closing, we deconsolidated the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II and recorded a gain in connection with this partial sale of $126.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on disposition of interests in properties, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The gain was recorded pursuant to ASC 360-20 and calculated based upon proceeds received, less 49% of the book value of the deconsolidated net assets. Our retained 51% non-controlling equity method interest was valued at historical cost based upon the pro rata book value of the retained interest in the net assets. We retain management and leasing responsibilities for the properties included in the O'Connor Joint Venture II. In connection with the formation of this joint venture, we recorded transaction costs of approximately $6.4 million as part of our basis in this investment.\nImpairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, a major anchor tenant of Rushmore Mall, located in Rapid City, South Dakota, informed us of their intention to close their store at the property. The impending closure was deemed a triggering event and, therefore, we evaluated this property in conjunction with our quarterly impairment review and preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We compared the estimated fair value of $37.5 million to the related carrying value of $75.0 million, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $37.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn October 4, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell Colonial Park Mall, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to an unaffiliated private real estate investor, which was sold on November 3, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, we shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for this asset, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. We compared the fair value measurement of the property to its relative carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $20.9 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to dispose of Morgantown Commons, located in Morgantown, West Virginia, which was sold in the second quarter of 2017. We shortened the hold period used in assessing impairment for the asset during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which resulted in the carrying value not being recoverable from the expected cash flows. The purchase offer represented the best available evidence of fair value for this property. We compared the fair value to the carrying value, which resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of approximately $8.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $21.9 million primarily related to noncore properties consisting of Gulf View Square, located in Port Richey, Florida; Richmond Town Square, located in Cleveland, Ohio; River Oaks Center, located in Chicago, Illinois; and Virginia Center Commons, located in Glen Allen, Virginia. The impairment charge was attributed to the continued declines in the fair value of the properties and executed agreements entered into in 2016 to sell these properties at prices below the carrying value. Each of the aforementioned noncore properties has been sold in accordance with the Company's strategic objectives.\nHurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma made landfall in Houston, Texas and Southern Florida, respectively. The Company had 15 assets experience damage attributed to the hurricanes, but no asset sustained catastrophic damage nor was there any loss of life. Further, no asset experienced a significant loss of business or functionality. The Company recognized approximately $900,000 of expense attributed to the damage, repairs and asset write-offs, which was below insurance deductible thresholds.\nBusiness Opportunities\nWe derive our revenues primarily from retail tenant leases, including fixed minimum rent leases, percentage rent leases based on tenants' sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses. We seek to re-lease our spaces at higher rents and increase our occupancy rates, and to enhance the performance of our properties and increase our revenues by, among other things, adding or replacing anchors or big-box tenants, re-developing or renovating existing properties to increase the leasable square footage, and increasing the productivity of occupied locations through aesthetic upgrades, re-merchandising and/or changes to the retail use of the space. We seek growth in earnings, FFO and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments.\nAdditionally, we feel there are opportunities to enhance our portfolio and balance sheet through active portfolio management. We believe that there are opportunities for us to acquire additional shopping centers that match our investment and strategic criteria. We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We also seek to dispose of or contribute to a joint venture assets that no longer meet our strategic criteria. These dispositions will be a combination of asset sales and transitions of over-levered properties to lenders or special servicers.\nWe consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable NOI (NOI for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this report.\nPortfolio Data\nThe portfolio data discussed in this overview includes key operating statistics for the Company including ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot and comparable NOI for the core properties owned at December 31, 2018. Towne West Square, located in Wichita, Kansas, and West Ridge Mall, located in Topeka, Kansas were identified as noncore properties.\nCore business fundamentals in the overall portfolio during 2018 were generally stable compared to 2017. Ending occupancy for the core portfolio was 93.9% as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 93.5% as of December 31, 2017. Average base minimum rent per square foot for the core portfolio decreased by 0.5% when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017. Comparable NOI decreased 3.0% for the core portfolio when comparing calendar year 2018 to 2017. Our core enclosed retail properties had a decrease in comparable NOI of 3.5%, which was driven primarily by the impact of 2018 department store bankruptcies filed and related co-tenancy impact. The core open air properties had a comparable NOI decrease of 1.7% in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily related to the Toys R Us bankruptcy and lower CAM capital spending in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth key operating statistics for the combined portfolio of core properties or interests in properties:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending occupancy (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average base minimum rent per square foot (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Ending occupancy is the percentage of GLA which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all Company-owned space except for anchors, majors, office and outlots at our enclosed retail properties in the calculation of ending occupancy. Open air property GLA included in the calculation relates to all Company-owned space other than office space. \n (2) Average base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  Current Leasing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we signed new leases and renewal leases with terms in excess of a year (excluding enclosed retail property anchors, majors, offices and in-line spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet) across the core portfolio, comprising approximately 2,188,100 square feet. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $23.82 per square foot (\"psf\") and for renewed leases was $26.87 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $31.54 psf for new leases and $5.23 psf for renewals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we signed new leases and renewal leases with terms in excess of a year (excluding enclosed retail property anchors, majors, offices and in-line spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet) across the comparable core portfolio, comprising approximately 2,497,800 square feet. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $24.78 psf and for renewed leases was $25.26 psf. For these leases, the average for tenant allowances was $36.05 psf for new leases and $3.40 psf for renewals.\nPortfolio Summary\nWe have provided some of our key operating metrics for our core enclosed retail property portfolio in different tiers. The purpose of the disclosure is to provide some distinction between the characteristics of the core enclosed retail properties. Tier 1 enclosed retail properties generally have higher occupancy, sales productivity and growth profiles, while Tier 2 enclosed retail properties are viable enclosed retail properties with lower productivity and modest growth profiles.\nThe table below provides some of our key metrics for the core enclosed retail property tiers as well as some key metrics for our open air property

in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We generally accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Many of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold as defined in their lease. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. \n \u2022 We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, ending occupancy, estimated market values or our decision to dispose of a property before the end of its estimated useful life. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, irrespective of changes in circumstances. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to expense the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, leasing prospects and local market information. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results. \n \u2022 To maintain its status as a REIT, WPG Inc. must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact WPG Inc.'s REIT status. In the unlikely event that WPG Inc. fails to maintain REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then it would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period it did not qualify as a REIT. If WPG Inc. lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods. \n \u2022 We make estimates as part of our recording of property acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the recording of the fair value of buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the recording of the fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as tenant sales, rents per square foot, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases. \n \u2022 A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of professional judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed when it is held available for occupancy, and accordingly, cease capitalization of costs upon opening. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAdoption of New Standards\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" using the modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014-09 revised GAAP by offering a single comprehensive revenue recognition standard instead of numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions. The impacted revenue streams primarily consist of fees earned from management, development and leasing services provided to joint ventures in which we own an interest and other ancillary income earned from our properties. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase equity of approximately $2.5 million related to changes in the revenue recognition pattern of lease commissions earned by the Company from our joint ventures. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nAdditionally, we adopted the clarified scope guidance of ASC 610-20, \"Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\" in conjunction with ASU 2014-09, using the modified retrospective approach. ASC 610-20 applies to the sale, transfer and derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales, and eliminates the guidance specific to real estate in ASC 360-20. With respect to full disposals, the recognition will generally be consistent with our current measurement and pattern of recognition. With respect to partial sales of real estate to joint ventures, the new guidance requires us to recognize a full gain where an equity investment is retained. These transactions could result in a basis difference as we will be required to measure our retained equity interest at fair value, whereas the joint venture may continue to measure the assets received at carryover basis. No adjustments were required upon adoption of this standard.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-12, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\" ASU 2017-12 aims to reduce complexity in cash value hedges of interest rate risk and eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, generally requiring the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.6 million between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\" and ASU 2016-18 \"Restricted Cash\" using a retrospective transition approach, which changed our statements of cash flows and related disclosures for all periods presented. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows and its adoption had no impact on our financial statements. ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2017, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.9 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $6.4 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $1.7 million were reclassified. For the year ended December 31, 2016, restricted cash related to cash flows provided by operating activities of $0.8 million, restricted cash related to cash flows used in investing activities of $1.5 million, and restricted cash related to cash flows used in financing activities of $10.4 million were reclassified. Restricted cash primarily relates to cash held in escrow for payment of real estate taxes and property reserves for maintenance, expansion or leasehold improvements as required by our mortgage loans. Restricted cash is included in \"Deferred costs and other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nNew Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.\nIn July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment that provides an entity the optional transition method to initially account for the impact of the adoption ASU 2016-02 with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2019 (the effective date of the ASU), rather than January 1, 2017, which would eliminate the need to restate amounts presented prior to January 1, 2019. We will utilize this optional transition method. From a lessee perspective, the Company currently has four material ground leases, two material office leases, and one material garage lease that, under the new guidance, will result in the recognition of a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. As of December 31, 2018, undiscounted future minimum lease payments due under these leases total approximately $31.1 million with termination dates which range from 2023 to 2076 and we expect the recognized lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset to not exceed $20.0 million upon adoption.\nFrom a lessor perspective, the new guidance remains mostly similar to current rules, though contract consideration will now be allocated between lease and non-lease components. Non-lease component allocations will be recognized under ASU 2014-09, and we expect that this will result in a different pattern of recognition for certain non-lease components, including for fixed common-area (\"CAM\") revenues.\nHowever, the FASB's amendment to ASU 2016-02 referred to above allows lessors to elect, as a practical expedient, not to allocate the total consideration to lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone selling prices. This practical expedient allows lessors to elect a combined single lease component presentation if (i) the timing and pattern of the revenue recognition of the combined single lease component is the same, and (ii) the combined single component would be classified as an operating lease. We believe we meet the criteria to use this practical expedient and we plan to elect this practical expedient upon the effective date. In addition, ASU 2016-02 limits the capitalization of leasing costs to initial direct costs, which will likely result in a reduction to our capitalized leasing costs and an increase to general and administrative expenses, though the amount of such changes is highly dependent upon the leasing compensation structures in place at the time of adoption. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company deferred $17.7 million and $16.9 million of internal leasing costs, respectively. From a lessor perspective, other than the reduction to capitalized leasing costs and increase to general and administrative expenses related to internal leasing costs based on the Company's current leasing compensation structure, which is not expected to change significantly upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \"Fair Value Measurements (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements.\" ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures, modifies certain disclosures, and adds additional disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following acquisitions and dispositions affected our results in the comparative periods:\n\u2022On November 16, 2018, we completed the sale of the fifth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 31, 2018, we completed the sale of the fourth tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On October 23, 2018, we transitioned Rushmore Mall to the lender.\n\u2022On July 27, 2018, we completed the sale of the third tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On June 29, 2018, we completed the sale of the second tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On April 24, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of Southgate Mall.\n\u2022On April 11, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of four Sears department stores located at Longview Mall, Polaris Fashion Place\u00ae (unconsolidated), Southern Hills Mall, and Town Center at Aurora.\n\u2022On January 12, 2018, we completed the sale of the first tranche of restaurant outparcels with Four Corners.\n\u2022On November 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Colonial Park Mall.\n\u2022On October 17, 2017, we completed a discounted payoff of the mortgage loan secured by Southern Hills Mall, located in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\u2022On October 3, 2017, we transitioned Valle Vista Mall, located in Harlingen, Texas, to the lender.\n\u2022On June 13, 2017, we sold 49% of our interest in Malibu Lumber Yard as part of the O'Connor Joint Venture II transaction.\n\u2022On June 7, 2017, we completed the sale of Morgantown Commons.\n\u2022On May 16, 2017, we completed the sale of an 80,000 square foot vacant anchor parcel at Indian Mound Mall, located in Heath, Ohio.\n\u2022On May 12, 2017, we completed the transaction forming the O'Connor Joint Venture II with regard to the ownership and operation of six of the Company's retail properties and certain related outparcels.

Our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow and borrowings under our debt arrangements, including our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or \"Revolver\", unsecured notes payable and senior unsecured term loans as further discussed below.\nWe derive most of our liquidity from leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations, the total of which was $287.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased $9.5 million during 2018 to $42.5 million as of December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to net repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and capital expenditures, partially offset by operating cash flow from properties, net distributions from our joint ventures, and the net proceeds from the disposition of properties. See \"Cash Flows\" below for more information.\nBecause we own primarily long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies on a combination of long-term mortgage debt as well as unsecured debt supported by a quality unencumbered asset pool, providing us with ample flexibility from a liquidity perspective. Our strategy is to have the majority of our debt fixed either through fixed rate mortgages or interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate. At December 31, 2018, floating rate debt (excluding loans hedged to fixed interest) comprised 15.2% of our total consolidated debt. We will continue to monitor our borrowing mix to limit market risk.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we successfully completed the issuance of $750.0 million of unsecured notes. The notes are due on August 15, 2024 and the proceeds were used to repay the $500.0 million Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\"), with a maturity date of May 30, 2018 and $230.0 million of the June 2015 Term Loan (as defined in \"Financing and Debt\") with a maturity date of March 2, 2020, respectively.\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2018, we amended and restated our Facility (as defined under \"The Facility.\"). Under the amended and restated terms, the Facility will mature in December 2022 assuming all extension options are exercised. Prior to the amendment and restatement, the Revolver matured on May 30, 2019, assuming all extension options were exercised. These transactions are reflective of our strategy to access the unsecured debt markets to extend our weighted average debt maturity.\nOn December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $359.8 million under the Revolver, net of outstanding borrowings of $290.0 million and $0.2 million reserved for outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average interest rate on the Revolver was 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, Fitch Ratings & Moody's Investor Service lowered their credit rating on WPG L.P.'s unsecured long-term indebtedness, which will increase interest rates on our Facility (as defined in \"Overview - Basis of Presentation - The Facility.\"), December 2015 Term Loan, and 5.950% Notes due 2024 as of February 2, 2019. Due to the downgrade, our Revolver will bear interest at LIBOR plus 165 basis points (an increase of 40 basis points), our Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 190 basis points (an increase of 45 basis points), and our December 2015 Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 235 basis points (an increase of 55 basis points). Our 5.950% Notes due 2024 will bear interest at 6.450% (an increase of 50 basis points). Assuming the new pricing grid was effective January 1, 2018, the impact would have resulted in an increase in borrowing costs of approximately $8.5 million during 2018. Such a downgrade may also impact terms and conditions of future borrowings in addition to adversely affecting our ability to access the public markets.\nThe consolidated indebtedness of our business was approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, or an increase of approximately $39.9 million from December 31, 2017. The change in consolidated indebtedness from December 31, 2017 is described in greater detail under \"Financing and Debt.\"\nOutlook\nOur business model and WPG Inc.'s status as a REIT requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance"}
