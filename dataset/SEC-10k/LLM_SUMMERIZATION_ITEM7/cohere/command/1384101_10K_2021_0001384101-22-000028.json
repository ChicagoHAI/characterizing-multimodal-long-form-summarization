MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a global diagnostics company that improves patient care by answering important clinical questions to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions throughout the patient journey in cancer and other diseases. Our growing menu of tests leverages advances in molecular science and machine learning technology to improve care for patients, enabling them to avoid risky, costly procedures and interventions, and reduce time to appropriate treatment.\nOur tests address eight of the 10 most prevalent cancers by incidence in the United States. In addition to making our tests available in the United States through our central laboratories, our exclusive license to the nCounter Analysis System positions us to deliver our tests to patients worldwide through laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally.\nWe develop tests that address significant unmet clinical needs in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases. We deploy a comprehensive strategic planning approach that broadly examines the clinical care spectrum in areas where our unique approach and expertise may potentially benefit physicians, patients and payers. In each disease area, our medical affairs and research teams focus intensely on understanding the patient journey and analyzing critical points of clinical decision-making, where having better information can impact what happens next for the patient.\nOur extensive team of research, bioinformatics and clinical professionals rely on deep scientific expertise and an extensive network of practicing physicians and key opinion leaders, or KOLs, to inform new product development. This includes determining what clinical question each test should answer, where it should be positioned in the patient work-up and what sample type and technology should be used. We develop our molecular tests using advanced scientific methods, such as RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning. Veracyte's tests are purposefully designed to integrate easily into current physician protocols, delivering clinical utility and economic value to physicians, payers, and the healthcare system.\nWe currently offer tests in thyroid cancer (Afirma); prostate cancer (Decipher Prostate); breast cancer (Prosigna); lung cancer (Percepta); interstitial lung diseases (Envisia); bladder cancer (Decipher Bladder); and colon cancer (Immunoscore). Our tests for kidney cancer and lymphoma are in development, the latter as a companion diagnostic.\nWe serve global markets with two complementary and inter-related core models. In the United States, we offer laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which we perform in our centralized, CLIA-certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, and Richmond, Virginia, supported by our cytopathology expertise in our Austin, Texas CLIA lab. In addition, outside of the United States, we intend to offer our tests as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests that run on the nCounter Analysis System by laboratories that perform them for physicians and their patients locally. We believe our broad menu of advanced diagnostic tests, combined with our ability to deliver them globally, uniquely position us in the diagnostics sector.\nIn the process of developing leading diagnostics across the oncology market, we have collected a significant number of patient samples and proprietary data related to various cancer types. We combine these assets with our robust machine learning core competency to further enhance our research capabilities, as well as build opportunities with biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nIn early 2021, Veracyte acquired Decipher Biosciences, expanding our genomic testing menu into urologic cancers. The acquisition also provided Veracyte with Decipher GRID (Genomic Resource for Intelligent Discovery), a platform and database that helps drive biopharmaceutical partnerships, KOL engagement and pipeline development in urologic cancers.\nIn mid-2021, we acquired HalioDx, giving us the capabilities and expertise to manufacture our own IVD test kits for use on the nCounter Analysis System. The acquisition also deepened our scientific expertise into the rapidly growing area of immuno-oncology, expanded our reach into colon cancer with the Immunoscore test and further strengthened our offerings to biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe believe the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak and its recent escalation due to the Delta and Omicron variants has impacted our test volumes. Our customers, third-party contract manufacturers, carriers, suppliers and collaboration partners have been affected by the closure of hospitals, doctors' offices, manufacturing sites, or country borders, among other measures put in place around the world. Layoffs, furloughs and unplanned loss of staff (due to vaccination status or other reasons) in the medical industry and otherwise during the pandemic have had, and will continue to have, negative impacts on the demand for and supply of medical care and diagnostic tests, which affects the frequency with which tests are ordered, and the ability of doctors and hospitals to administer such tests. Further the inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to expand utilization of our products into new geographies and to drive awareness of our products.\nOur Decipher Prostate test has been least impacted by the pandemic because our customers are mostly community-based urology practices, which generally remain more accessible to patients and our sales reps. Our Afirma thyroid cancer test has been impacted by COVID-19 because a majority of our samples come from institutions, which are less accessible to patients and our reps. We believe our pulmonology business continues to be most impacted since the bronchoscopy procedures used to collect samples for our Percepta and Envisia tests are considered elective procedures and are performed in hospital settings, which continue to be more restrictive, and these tests are ordered by pulmonologists who are currently largely preoccupied with caring for COVID-19 patients.\nThe rapid increase in daily COVID-19 testing consumes reagents and supplies otherwise available to diagnostic testing companies like ours across the United States. When not limited by the expiration date of products and when we feel it reasonable and feasible to do so, we are taking steps to manage our level of stock reserves, to develop alternative sources of supply and to implement procedures to mitigate the impact on our supply chain and our ability to process samples in our laboratories. Though we are in regular contact with our key suppliers, we do not have, nor expect to have, the necessary insight into our vendors' supply chain issues that we may need to know to effectively mitigate the impact to our business. Though we attempt to mitigate the impact to our business, these interruptions in manufacturing (including the sourcing of reagents or supplies) may negatively impact our test volumes or levels of revenue.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the deployment and long-term efficacy of vaccines; the duration and spread of the outbreak particularly in the form of more transmissible variants; the impact on our customers' operations; and the impact to our sales and renewal cycles. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nReported Test Volume\nOur performance depends on the number of tests that we perform and report as completed in our CLIA-certified laboratories and tests processed on the nCounter Analysis System. Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on patients seeking to have tests performed;\n\u2022the availability of hospital staff to perform and support procedures needed to collect samples for our tests;\n\u2022the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed;\n\u2022the quantity and quality of the sample received;\n\u2022receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests;\n\u2022the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed;\n\u2022the time it takes us to perform our tests and report the results;\n\u2022the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work days per period, timing of industry conferences and the timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests.\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from Afirma genomic testing services, including the rendering of a cytopathology diagnosis as part of the Afirma solution. For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result, and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. Our sales teams are aligned under our general manager-based structure to focus on specific products and global markets. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate any acquired assets into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from Decipher Biosciences in March 2021 and HalioDx in August 2021 may impact our revenue and operating results through integration of various functions.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our biopharmaceutical and IVD contract manufacturing partners depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration partners pay us for the provision of data and other services and the achievement of milestones.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect.\nFinally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average test reimbursement rates will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nWe enter into arrangements to license or provide access to our assets or services, including testing services, clinical and medical services, research and development, contract manufacturing and other services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, data, services, manufactured diagnostic test kits, access and/or testing services to partner biopharmaceutical companies. One such arrangement is a collaborative arrangement that falls under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration paid to us in the form of nonrefundable fees; payments on delivery of data, test results or manufactured products; costs of service plus margin; performance milestone payments; expense reimbursements and possibly royalty and/or other payments. Net sales of data or other services to our customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Milestone payments which fall under the scope of ASC 808, are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are considered to be collaboration revenue. Payments received that are not related to sales or services to a customer or collaboration revenue are recorded as offsets against research and development expense or cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one good or service delivered to a customer, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if the selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred which may be at a point in time or over time. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests to further improve patient guidance and care globally. For this, we leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology, spatial immunohistochemistry and machine learning, as well as our robust biorepositories and our exclusive diagnostics rights to the nCounter Analysis System.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2021, we had derived most of our revenue from the sale of Afirma and the Decipher urologic tests, delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of testing revenue are laboratory expenses, sample collection kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of testing revenue as a percentage of testing revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of testing revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of testing revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, quality control batches, test batches and registry samples, and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of testing revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products, and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers.\nCost of Biopharmaceutical Revenue\nOur cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and contract testing services on behalf of a customer, and is mainly comprised of compensation expense, laboratory supplies and pass-through costs.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include expenses incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products and pipeline. These expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct research and development expenses such as prototype materials, laboratory supplies and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, other miscellaneous expenses and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred a majority of our research and development expenses in years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 in support of our pipeline products. Going forward, we are investing in the development of our pipeline products, including required clinical studies, the development of current tests for the nCounter instrument and the transition of manufacturing to our Veracyte SAS facility.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. Our sales team of approximately 150 representatives is organized by business unit, with separate teams calling on thyroid cancer, urologic cancers, breast cancer, pulmonology and colorectal cancers physicians. The business units have dedicated marketing support, as well as a marketing operations team that serves the commercial organization broadly. Prosigna sales outside of the U.S. are led by direct sales teams that call on laboratories and breast cancer oncologists, and have dedicated marketing support.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and\nother expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx were included in general and administrative compensation expense and professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of the average headcount classified as general and administrative encompass our billing and customer care teams. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our general and administration functions to support our global revenue growth.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nOur finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in business combinations, are being amortized over 4 to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $22.0 million per year through 2024 and decreases thereafter.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under debt agreements and costs associated with the prepayment of debt.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, French research tax credits, interest expense on our debt and interest income from our cash held in interest bearing accounts. The French research tax credits (cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t recherche or CIR) are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of the agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nGenerally, we determine accrual rates based on the average reimbursement from payers for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects.\nWe use judgment in determining accrual rates and our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain reimbursement experience.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nFor biopharmaceutical and other revenue, we develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include independent evidence of market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and we measure the services delivered to the collaborative partner which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within either party's control, such as non-operational developmental and regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones that are within either party's control, such as operational developmental milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to our estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. One collaboration arrangement with milestone payments falls under the scope of ASC 808. These milestone payments are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nAcquisitions\nWe first determine whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The estimation of the fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the present value of the expected payments calculated by assessing the likelihood of when the related milestones would be achieved, discounted using our estimated borrowing rate.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nWe have acquired finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets in business combinations. These intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition dates. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using income approaches such as the multi-period excess earnings method, the with-and-without method and the relief from royalty method. These income approaches are based on various estimates for each asset including the\nestimate of future cash flows including, revenue assumptions (such as projected testing volumes, growth rates), discount rates and the expected economic life/obsolescence factors of the respective assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years, based on management's estimate of the period over which their economic benefits will be realized, product life and patent life. Our in-process research and development, or IPR&D, is not amortized until it becomes commercially viable and placed in service. At the time when the IPR&D is placed in service, we will determine a useful life. We test these intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amounts. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Performance-based stock units, which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, are subject to the employees' continued service with the Company. The probability of vesting is assessed at each reporting period and compensation cost is adjusted based on this probability assessment. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiary Veracyte SAS is the Euro. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.

The CIR are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France. We recognize other income from the CIR over time based on when the research and development expenses are incurred.\nComparison of Other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through December 31, 2021, we have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $75.6 million, $34.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2022 and potentially in future years. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $357.2 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $173.2 million as of December 31, 2021, our available revolving line of credit, and our revenue during the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of costs to run our laboratories, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, working capital, costs to service our Loan and Security Agreement (See Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our Loan and Security Agreement), capital expenditures, lease\nobligations and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, including due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, restrictions on our cash pursuant to the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Loan and Security Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third-party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our products or development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nOn February 9, 2021, we issued and sold 8,547,297 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 1,114,864 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters' exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $74.00 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were $593.8 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses of $38.7 million.\nIn August 2020, we issued and sold 6,900,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 900,000 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters' exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $30.00 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $193.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $13.2 million.\nIn May 2019, we issued and sold 6,325,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 825,000 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters' exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $23.25 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $137.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $9.2 million.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease office and laboratory facilities in South San Francisco and San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Marseille, France; and Richmond, Virginia, and lease certain equipment under various non-cancelable lease agreements. The lease terms extend to October 2030 and contain extension of lease term and expansion options. As of December 31, 2021, the leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.8 years and total future minimum lease payments of $20.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Veracyte SAS has signed a lease agreement for facilities which will be constructed in Marseille, France. The lease will commence upon completion of the construction of the office building which we currently expect to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023 at which time we will record a lease liability and a corresponding ROU asset. The initial term of the lease will be twelve years with annual rent of approximately $1.4 million, which is subject to change based on final construction.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The Loan and Security Agreement allows us to borrow up to $35.0 million, with a $25.0 million term loan, or Term Loan, and a revolving line\nof credit of up to $10.0 million, or the Revolving Line of Credit, subject to, with respect to the Revolving Line of Credit, a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable. The Term Loan was advanced upon the closing of the Loan and Security Agreement. Borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement mature in October 2022. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to (i) the thirty-day U.S. London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus (ii) 4.20%, with a minimum rate of 5.43% per annum. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus (ii) 3.50%, with a minimum rate of 4.70% per annum. We are also required to pay an annual facility fee on the Revolving Line of Credit of $25,000.\nWe may prepay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan plus accrued and unpaid interest and, if the Term Loan is repaid in full, a prepayment premium of $250,000. If the Loan and Security Agreement is terminated before maturity, then a termination fee equal to 1% of the Revolving Line of Credit, or $0.1 million, will be due. In addition, a final payment on the Term Loan in the amount of $1.2 million is due upon the earlier of the maturity date of the Term Loan or its payment in full. In 2019 and 2020, we prepaid $24.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of the principal amount of the Term Loan Advance and did not incur any prepayment premium as we did not repay the Term Loan Advance in full. As of December 31, 2021, the principal balance outstanding was one dollar.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with debt covenants.\nOur obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets (excluding intellectual property), subject to certain customary exceptions.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,621) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,711) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,232) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(739,206) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,837) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,733) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>596,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,287 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $31.6 million.

This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. This ASU removes the following exceptions: (1) exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (2) exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment; (3) exception to the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary; and (4) exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments in this ASU also improve consistency and simplify other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The revised guidance will be applied prospectively and became effective for us beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at\namounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures from the adoption of this guidance.", "summary": "- We incur expense for tests in the period

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a global diagnostics company that improves patient care by answering important clinical questions to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions throughout the patient journey in cancer and other diseases. Our growing menu of tests leverages advances in molecular science and machine learning technology to improve care for patients, enabling them to avoid risky, costly procedures and interventions, and reduce time to appropriate treatment.\nOur tests address eight of the 10 most prevalent cancers by incidence in the United States. In addition to making our tests available in the United States through our central laboratories, our exclusive license to the nCounter Analysis System positions us to deliver our tests to patients worldwide through laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally.\nWe develop tests that address significant unmet clinical needs in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases. We deploy a comprehensive strategic planning approach that broadly examines the clinical care spectrum in areas where our unique approach and expertise may potentially benefit physicians, patients and payers. In each disease area, our medical affairs and research teams focus intensely on understanding the patient journey and analyzing critical points of clinical decision-making, where having better information can impact what happens next for the patient.\nOur extensive team of research, bioinformatics and clinical professionals rely on deep scientific expertise and an extensive network of practicing physicians and key opinion leaders, or KOLs, to inform new product development. This includes determining what clinical question each test should answer, where it should be positioned in the patient work-up and what sample type and technology should be used. We develop our molecular tests using advanced scientific methods, such as RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning. Veracyte's tests are purposefully designed to integrate easily into current physician protocols, delivering clinical utility and economic value to physicians, payers, and the healthcare system.\nWe currently offer tests in thyroid cancer (Afirma); prostate cancer (Decipher Prostate); breast cancer (Prosigna); lung cancer (Percepta); interstitial lung diseases (Envisia); bladder cancer (Decipher Bladder); and colon cancer (Immunoscore). Our tests for kidney cancer and lymphoma are in development, the latter as a companion diagnostic.\nWe serve global markets with two complementary and inter-related core models. In the United States, we offer laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which we perform in our centralized, CLIA-certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, and Richmond, Virginia, supported by our cytopathology expertise in our Austin, Texas CLIA lab. In addition, outside of the United States, we intend to offer our tests as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests that run on the nCounter Analysis System by laboratories that perform them for physicians and their patients locally. We believe our broad menu of advanced diagnostic tests, combined with our ability to deliver them globally, uniquely position us in the diagnostics sector.\nIn the process of developing leading diagnostics across the oncology market, we have collected a significant number of patient samples and proprietary data related to various cancer types. We combine these assets with our robust machine learning core competency to further enhance our research capabilities, as well as build opportunities with biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nIn early 2021, Veracyte acquired Decipher Biosciences, expanding our genomic testing menu into urologic cancers. The acquisition also provided Veracyte with Decipher GRID (Genomic Resource for Intelligent Discovery), a platform and database that helps drive biopharmaceutical partnerships, KOL engagement and pipeline development in urologic cancers.\nIn mid-2021, we acquired HalioDx, giving us the capabilities and expertise to manufacture our own IVD test kits for use on the nCounter Analysis System. The acquisition also deepened our scientific expertise into the rapidly growing area of immuno-oncology, expanded our reach into colon cancer with the Immunoscore test and further strengthened our offerings to biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe believe the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak and its recent escalation due to the Delta and Omicron variants has impacted our test volumes. Our customers, third-party contract manufacturers, carriers, suppliers and collaboration partners have been affected by the closure of hospitals, doctors' offices, manufacturing sites, or country borders, among other measures put in place around the world. Layoffs, furloughs and unplanned loss of staff (due to vaccination status or other reasons) in the medical industry and otherwise during the pandemic have had, and will continue to have, negative impacts on the demand for and supply of medical care and diagnostic tests, which affects the frequency with which tests are ordered, and the ability of doctors and hospitals to administer such tests. Further the inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to expand utilization of our products into new geographies and to drive awareness of our products.\nOur Decipher Prostate test has been least impacted by the pandemic because our customers are mostly community-based urology practices, which generally remain more accessible to patients and our sales reps. Our Afirma thyroid cancer test has been impacted by COVID-19 because a majority of our samples come from institutions, which are less accessible to patients and our reps. We believe our pulmonology business continues to be most impacted since the bronchoscopy procedures used to collect samples for our Percepta and Envisia tests are considered elective procedures and are performed in hospital settings, which continue to be more restrictive, and these tests are ordered by pulmonologists who are currently largely preoccupied with caring for COVID-19 patients.\nThe rapid increase in daily COVID-19 testing consumes reagents and supplies otherwise available to diagnostic testing companies like ours across the United States. When not limited by the expiration date of products and when we feel it reasonable and feasible to do so, we are taking steps to manage our level of stock reserves, to develop alternative sources of supply and to implement procedures to mitigate the impact on our supply chain and our ability to process samples in our laboratories. Though we are in regular contact with our key suppliers, we do not have, nor expect to have, the necessary insight into our vendors' supply chain issues that we may need to know to effectively mitigate the impact to our business. Though we attempt to mitigate the impact to our business, these interruptions in manufacturing (including the sourcing of reagents or supplies) may negatively impact our test volumes or levels of revenue.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the deployment and long-term efficacy of vaccines; the duration and spread of the outbreak particularly in the form of more transmissible variants; the impact on our customers' operations; and the impact to our sales and renewal cycles. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nReported Test Volume\nOur performance depends on the number of tests that we perform and report as completed in our CLIA-certified laboratories and tests processed on the nCounter Analysis System. Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on patients seeking to have tests performed;\n\u2022the availability of hospital staff to perform and support procedures needed to collect samples for our tests;\n\u2022the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed;\n\u2022the quantity and quality of the sample received;\n\u2022receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests;\n\u2022the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed;\n\u2022the time it takes us to perform our tests and report the results;\n\u2022the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work days per period, timing of industry conferences and the timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests.\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from Afirma genomic testing services, including the rendering of a cytopathology diagnosis as part of the Afirma solution. For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result, and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. Our sales teams are aligned under our general manager-based structure to focus on specific products and global markets. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate any acquired assets into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from Decipher Biosciences in March 2021 and HalioDx in August 2021 may impact our revenue and operating results through integration of various functions.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our biopharmaceutical and IVD contract manufacturing partners depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration partners pay us for the provision of data and other services and the achievement of milestones.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect.\nFinally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average test reimbursement rates will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nWe enter into arrangements to license or provide access to our assets or services, including testing services, clinical and medical services, research and development, contract manufacturing and other services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, data, services, manufactured diagnostic test kits, access and/or testing services to partner biopharmaceutical companies. One such arrangement is a collaborative arrangement that falls under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration paid to us in the form of nonrefundable fees; payments on delivery of data, test results or manufactured products; costs of service plus margin; performance milestone payments; expense reimbursements and possibly royalty and/or other payments. Net sales of data or other services to our customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Milestone payments which fall under the scope of ASC 808, are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are considered to be collaboration revenue. Payments received that are not related to sales or services to a customer or collaboration revenue are recorded as offsets against research and development expense or cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one good or service delivered to a customer, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if the selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred which may be at a point in time or over time. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests to further improve patient guidance and care globally. For this, we leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology, spatial immunohistochemistry and machine learning, as well as our robust biorepositories and our exclusive diagnostics rights to the nCounter Analysis System.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2021, we had derived most of our revenue from the sale of Afirma and the Decipher urologic tests, delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\n\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of testing revenue are laboratory expenses, sample collection kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of testing revenue as a percentage of testing revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of testing revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of testing revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, quality control batches, test batches and registry samples, and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of testing revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products, and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers.\nCost of Biopharmaceutical Revenue\nOur cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and contract testing services on behalf of a customer, and is mainly comprised of compensation expense, laboratory supplies and pass-through costs.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include expenses incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products and pipeline. These expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct research and development expenses such as prototype materials, laboratory supplies and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, other miscellaneous expenses and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred a majority of our research and development expenses in years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 in support of our pipeline products. Going forward, we are investing in the development of our pipeline products, including required clinical studies, the development of current tests for the nCounter instrument and the transition of manufacturing to our Veracyte SAS facility.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. Our sales team of approximately 150 representatives is organized by business unit, with separate teams calling on thyroid cancer, urologic cancers, breast cancer, pulmonology and colorectal cancers physicians. The business units have dedicated marketing support, as well as a marketing operations team that serves the commercial organization broadly. Prosigna sales outside of the U.S. are led by direct sales teams that call on laboratories and breast cancer oncologists, and have dedicated marketing support.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and\nother expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx were included in general and administrative compensation expense and professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of the average headcount classified as general and administrative encompass our billing and customer care teams. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our general and administration functions to support our global revenue growth.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nOur finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in business combinations, are being amortized over 4 to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $22.0 million per year through 2024 and decreases thereafter.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under debt agreements and costs associated with the prepayment of debt.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, French research tax credits, interest expense on our debt and interest income from our cash held in interest bearing accounts. The French research tax credits (cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t recherche or CIR) are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of the agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nGenerally, we determine accrual rates based on the average reimbursement from payers for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects.\nWe use judgment in determining accrual rates and our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain reimbursement experience.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nFor biopharmaceutical and other revenue, we develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include independent evidence of market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and we measure the services delivered to the collaborative partner which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within either party's control, such as non-operational developmental and regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones that are within either party's control, such as operational developmental milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to our estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. One collaboration arrangement with milestone payments falls under the scope of ASC 808. These milestone payments are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nAcquisitions\nWe first determine whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The estimation of the fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the present value of the expected payments calculated by assessing the likelihood of when the related milestones would be achieved, discounted using our estimated borrowing rate.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nWe have acquired finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets in business combinations. These intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition dates. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using income approaches such as the multi-period excess earnings method, the with-and-without method and the relief from royalty method. These income approaches are based on various estimates for each asset including the\nestimate of future cash flows including, revenue assumptions (such as projected testing volumes, growth rates), discount rates and the expected economic life/obsolescence factors of the respective assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years, based on management's estimate of the period over which their economic benefits will be realized, product life and patent life. Our in-process research and development, or IPR&D, is not amortized until it becomes commercially viable and placed in service. At the time when the IPR&D is placed in service, we will determine a useful life. We test these intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amounts. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Performance-based stock units, which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, are subject to the employees' continued service with the Company. The probability of vesting is assessed at each reporting period and compensation cost is adjusted based on this probability assessment. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiary Veracyte SAS is the Euro. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses from our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other (loss) income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except percentages)\n\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $102.0 million, or 87%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to an $86.2 million increase in testing revenue from an 88% volume increase in our diagnostic tests, as well as a $1.6 million increase in sales of Prosigna. Tests reported for the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes the Decipher urology tests, which contributed $65.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue increased $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $4.0 million of collaboration revenue from the fulfillment of obligations relating to development milestones under a Johnson & Johnson diagnostic development agreement. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes the operations of HalioDx following its acquisition.\nComparison of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nCost of revenue\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nCost of testing revenue increased $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Following the acquisition of Decipher Biosciences in March 2021, its operations are included in cost of testing revenue and contributed approximately $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in laboratory costs was primarily related to an 88% increase in the volume of diagnostic tests reported, including Decipher tests. The increase in sample collection costs primarily related to the 88% increase in the volume of diagnostic tests reported. The increase in compensation expense related to a headcount increase of 162%, including the addition of Decipher Biosciences employees.\nCost of product revenue is related to sales of Prosigna. Cost of product revenue increased $1.0 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a 15% increase in product tests sold.\nCost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue includes labor costs incurred by our employees working on customer projects and laboratory supplies and pass-through expenses incurred on these projects. Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue includes the operations of HalioDx following its acquisition on August 2, 2021, which contributed approximately $9.3 million to cost of revenue.\nComparison of cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nResearch and development\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nResearch and development expense increased $12.6 million or 73% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Compensation expense increased $9.4 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount including the addition of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx employees.\nComparison of research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nSelling and marketing\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nSelling and marketing expense increased $27.5 million, or 52%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to temporary furloughs and termination of employees in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, by the addition of Decipher Biosciences employees in March 2021 and HalioDx employees in August 2021. The increase in direct marketing expenses were primarily due to increased outside marketing costs and the addition of Decipher Biosciences.\nComparison of selling and marketing expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nGeneral and administrative\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $64.6 million, or 176%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists of costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx, including $27.0 million of stock-based compensation as well as $20.1 million of professional fees and other costs associated with the transactions. Following the acquisitions, Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx operations also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase in compensation expense was also due to an increase in headcount, including the addition of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx employees. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher IT costs. General and administrative expenses related to occupancy costs and information technology costs are allocated monthly to general and administrative expense, selling and marketing expense, research and development expense, and cost of revenue based on the headcount and employee location.\nComparison of general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net, decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 million of unrealized foreign currency gain(loss) and a decrease of $0.5 million of interest and dividend income partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million from the CIR related to operations in France. The CIR are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France. We recognize other income from the CIR over time based on when the research and development expenses are incurred.\nComparison of Other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through December 31, 2021, we have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $75.6 million, $34.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2022 and potentially in future years. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $357.2 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $173.2 million as of December 31, 2021, our available revolving line of credit, and our revenue during the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of costs to run our laboratories, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, working capital, costs to service our Loan and Security Agreement (See Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our Loan and Security Agreement), capital expenditures, lease\nobligations and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, including due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, restrictions on our cash pursuant to the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Loan and Security Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a global diagnostics company that improves patient care by answering important clinical questions to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions throughout the patient journey in cancer and other diseases. Our growing menu of tests leverages advances in molecular science and machine learning technology to improve care for patients, enabling them to avoid risky, costly procedures and interventions, and reduce time to appropriate treatment.\nOur tests address eight of the 10 most prevalent cancers by incidence in the United States. In addition to making our tests available in the United States through our central laboratories, our exclusive license to the nCounter Analysis System positions us to deliver our tests to patients worldwide through laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally.\nWe develop tests that address significant unmet clinical needs in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases. We deploy a comprehensive strategic planning approach that broadly examines the clinical care spectrum in areas where our unique approach and expertise may potentially benefit physicians, patients and payers. In each disease area, our medical affairs and research teams focus intensely on understanding the patient journey and analyzing critical points of clinical decision-making, where having better information can impact what happens next for the patient.\nOur extensive team of research, bioinformatics and clinical professionals rely on deep scientific expertise and an extensive network of practicing physicians and key opinion leaders, or KOLs, to inform new product development. This includes determining what clinical question each test should answer, where it should be positioned in the patient work-up and what sample type and technology should be used. We develop our molecular tests using advanced scientific methods, such as RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning. Veracyte's tests are purposefully designed to integrate easily into current physician protocols, delivering clinical utility and economic value to physicians, payers, and the healthcare system.\nWe currently offer tests in thyroid cancer (Afirma); prostate cancer (Decipher Prostate); breast cancer (Prosigna); lung cancer (Percepta); interstitial lung diseases (Envisia); bladder cancer (Decipher Bladder); and colon cancer (Immunoscore). Our tests for kidney cancer and lymphoma are in development, the latter as a companion diagnostic.\nWe serve global markets with two complementary and inter-related core models. In the United States, we offer laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which we perform in our centralized, CLIA-certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, and Richmond, Virginia, supported by our cytopathology expertise in our Austin, Texas CLIA lab. In addition, outside of the United States, we intend to offer our tests as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, tests that run on the nCounter Analysis System by laboratories that perform them for physicians and their patients locally. We believe our broad menu of advanced diagnostic tests, combined with our ability to deliver them globally, uniquely position us in the diagnostics sector.\nIn the process of developing leading diagnostics across the oncology market, we have collected a significant number of patient samples and proprietary data related to various cancer types. We combine these assets with our robust machine learning core competency to further enhance our research capabilities, as well as build opportunities with biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nIn early 2021, Veracyte acquired Decipher Biosciences, expanding our genomic testing menu into urologic cancers. The acquisition also provided Veracyte with Decipher GRID (Genomic Resource for Intelligent Discovery), a platform and database that helps drive biopharmaceutical partnerships, KOL engagement and pipeline development in urologic cancers.\nIn mid-2021, we acquired HalioDx, giving us the capabilities and expertise to manufacture our own IVD test kits for use on the nCounter Analysis System. The acquisition also deepened our scientific expertise into the rapidly growing area of immuno-oncology, expanded our reach into colon cancer with the Immunoscore test and further strengthened our offerings to biopharmaceutical and other partners.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe believe the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak and its recent escalation due to the Delta and Omicron variants has impacted our test volumes. Our customers, third-party contract manufacturers, carriers, suppliers and collaboration partners have been affected by the closure of hospitals, doctors' offices, manufacturing sites, or country borders, among other measures put in place around the world. Layoffs, furloughs and unplanned loss of staff (due to vaccination status or other reasons) in the medical industry and otherwise during the pandemic have had, and will continue to have, negative impacts on the demand for and supply of medical care and diagnostic tests, which affects the frequency with which tests are ordered, and the ability of doctors and hospitals to administer such tests. Further the inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to expand utilization of our products into new geographies and to drive awareness of our products.\nOur Decipher Prostate test has been least impacted by the pandemic because our customers are mostly community-based urology practices, which generally remain more accessible to patients and our sales reps. Our Afirma thyroid cancer test has been impacted by COVID-19 because a majority of our samples come from institutions, which are less accessible to patients and our reps. We believe our pulmonology business continues to be most impacted since the bronchoscopy procedures used to collect samples for our Percepta and Envisia tests are considered elective procedures and are performed in hospital settings, which continue to be more restrictive, and these tests are ordered by pulmonologists who are currently largely preoccupied with caring for COVID-19 patients.\nThe rapid increase in daily COVID-19 testing consumes reagents and supplies otherwise available to diagnostic testing companies like ours across the United States. When not limited by the expiration date of products and when we feel it reasonable and feasible to do so, we are taking steps to manage our level of stock reserves, to develop alternative sources of supply and to implement procedures to mitigate the impact on our supply chain and our ability to process samples in our laboratories. Though we are in regular contact with our key suppliers, we do not have, nor expect to have, the necessary insight into our vendors' supply chain issues that we may need to know to effectively mitigate the impact to our business. Though we attempt to mitigate the impact to our business, these interruptions in manufacturing (including the sourcing of reagents or supplies) may negatively impact our test volumes or levels of revenue.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the deployment and long-term efficacy of vaccines; the duration and spread of the outbreak particularly in the form of more transmissible variants; the impact on our customers' operations; and the impact to our sales and renewal cycles. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nReported Test Volume\nOur performance depends on the number of tests that we perform and report as completed in our CLIA-certified laboratories and tests processed on the nCounter Analysis System. Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on patients seeking to have tests performed;\n\u2022the availability of hospital staff to perform and support procedures needed to collect samples for our tests;\n\u2022the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed;\n\u2022the quantity and quality of the sample received;\n\u2022receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests;\n\u2022the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed;\n\u2022the time it takes us to perform our tests and report the results;\n\u2022the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work days per period, timing of industry conferences and the timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests.\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from Afirma genomic testing services, including the rendering of a cytopathology diagnosis as part of the Afirma solution. For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result, and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. Our sales teams are aligned under our general manager-based structure to focus on specific products and global markets. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate any acquired assets into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from Decipher Biosciences in March 2021 and HalioDx in August 2021 may impact our revenue and operating results through integration of various functions.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our biopharmaceutical and IVD contract manufacturing partners depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration partners pay us for the provision of data and other services and the achievement of milestones.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect.\nFinally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average test reimbursement rates will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nWe enter into arrangements to license or provide access to our assets or services, including testing services, clinical and medical services, research and development, contract manufacturing and other services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, data, services, manufactured diagnostic test kits, access and/or testing services to partner biopharmaceutical companies. One such arrangement is a collaborative arrangement that falls under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration paid to us in the form of nonrefundable fees; payments on delivery of data, test results or manufactured products; costs of service plus margin; performance milestone payments; expense reimbursements and possibly royalty and/or other payments. Net sales of data or other services to our customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Milestone payments which fall under the scope of ASC 808, are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are considered to be collaboration revenue. Payments received that are not related to sales or services to a customer or collaboration revenue are recorded as offsets against research and development expense or cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one good or service delivered to a customer, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if the selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred which may be at a point in time or over time. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests to further improve patient guidance and care globally. For this, we leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology, spatial immunohistochemistry and machine learning, as well as our robust biorepositories and our exclusive diagnostics rights to the nCounter Analysis System.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2021, we had derived most of our revenue from the sale of Afirma and the Decipher urologic tests, delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of testing revenue are laboratory expenses, sample collection kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of testing revenue as a percentage of testing revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of testing revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of testing revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, quality control batches, test batches and registry samples, and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of testing revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nOur cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products, and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers.\nCost of Biopharmaceutical Revenue\nOur cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and contract testing services on behalf of a customer, and is mainly comprised of compensation expense, laboratory supplies and pass-through costs.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include expenses incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products and pipeline. These expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct research and development expenses such as prototype materials, laboratory supplies and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, other miscellaneous expenses and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred a majority of our research and development expenses in years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 in support of our pipeline products. Going forward, we are investing in the development of our pipeline products, including required clinical studies, the development of current tests for the nCounter instrument and the transition of manufacturing to our Veracyte SAS facility.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. Our sales team of approximately 150 representatives is organized by business unit, with separate teams calling on thyroid cancer, urologic cancers, breast cancer, pulmonology and colorectal cancers physicians. The business units have dedicated marketing support, as well as a marketing operations team that serves the commercial organization broadly. Prosigna sales outside of the U.S. are led by direct sales teams that call on laboratories and breast cancer oncologists, and have dedicated marketing support.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and\nother expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx were included in general and administrative compensation expense and professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of the average headcount classified as general and administrative encompass our billing and customer care teams. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our general and administration functions to support our global revenue growth.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nOur finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in business combinations, are being amortized over 4 to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $22.0 million per year through 2024 and decreases thereafter.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under debt agreements and costs associated with the prepayment of debt.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, French research tax credits, interest expense on our debt and interest income from our cash held in interest bearing accounts. The French research tax credits (cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t recherche or CIR) are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nTesting Revenue\nWe bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of the agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nGenerally, we determine accrual rates based on the average reimbursement from payers for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects.\nWe use judgment in determining accrual rates and our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain reimbursement experience.\nProduct Revenue\nOur products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System and related diagnostic kits. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Other Revenues\nFor biopharmaceutical and other revenue, we develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include independent evidence of market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and we measure the services delivered to the collaborative partner which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within either party's control, such as non-operational developmental and regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones that are within either party's control, such as operational developmental milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to our estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. One collaboration arrangement with milestone payments falls under the scope of ASC 808. These milestone payments are recognized in the same manner as milestone payments from customers and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nAcquisitions\nWe first determine whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The estimation of the fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the present value of the expected payments calculated by assessing the likelihood of when the related milestones would be achieved, discounted using our estimated borrowing rate.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nWe have acquired finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets in business combinations. These intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition dates. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using income approaches such as the multi-period excess earnings method, the with-and-without method and the relief from royalty method. These income approaches are based on various estimates for each asset including the\nestimate of future cash flows including, revenue assumptions (such as projected testing volumes, growth rates), discount rates and the expected economic life/obsolescence factors of the respective assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years, based on management's estimate of the period over which their economic benefits will be realized, product life and patent life. Our in-process research and development, or IPR&D, is not amortized until it becomes commercially viable and placed in service. At the time when the IPR&D is placed in service, we will determine a useful life. We test these intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amounts. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Performance-based stock units, which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, are subject to the employees' continued service with the Company. The probability of vesting is assessed at each reporting period and compensation cost is adjusted based on this probability assessment. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiary Veracyte SAS is the Euro. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses from our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other (loss) income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31,

This was primarily due to an $86.2 million increase in testing revenue from an 88% volume increase in our diagnostic tests, as well as a $1.6 million increase in sales of Prosigna. Tests reported for the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes the Decipher urology tests, which contributed $65.9 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue increased $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $4.0 million of collaboration revenue from the fulfillment of obligations relating to development milestones under a Johnson & Johnson diagnostic development agreement. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 also includes the operations of HalioDx following its acquisition.\nComparison of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nCost of revenue\nComparison of the years ended

Following the acquisitions, Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx operations also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase in compensation expense was also due to an increase in headcount, including the addition of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx employees. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher IT costs. General and administrative expenses related to occupancy costs and information technology costs are allocated monthly to general and administrative expense, selling and marketing expense, research and development expense, and cost of revenue based on the headcount and employee location.\nComparison of general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net, decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 million of unrealized foreign currency gain(loss) and a decrease of $0.5 million of interest and dividend income partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million from the CIR related to operations in France. The CIR are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France. We recognize other income from the CIR over time based on when the research and development expenses are incurred.\nComparison of Other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 22, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through December 31, 2021, we have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had net losses of $75.6 million, $34.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2022 and potentially in future years. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $357.2 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $173.2 million as of December 31, 2021, our available revolving line of credit, and our revenue during the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of costs to run our laboratories, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, working capital, costs to service our Loan and Security Agreement (See Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our Loan and Security Agreement), capital expenditures, lease\nobligations and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, including due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, restrictions on our cash pursuant to the terms of our Loan and Security Agreement and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Loan and Security Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market"}
