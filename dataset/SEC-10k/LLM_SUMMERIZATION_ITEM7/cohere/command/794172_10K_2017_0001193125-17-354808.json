The fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results include $762 of costs associated with the transition to our new CEO, announced October 10, 2017, and litigation costs associated with protecting certain intellectual property (collectively, \u201cCEO transition and IP defense costs\u201d) (impact on net earnings of $495, or $0.01 per diluted share). The fiscal 2016 fourth quarter results included $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership (impact on net earnings of $431, or $0.01 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $49,697, an increase of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; increasing 5% on a constant-currency basis.\nShowing positive signs of stabilization and a return to revenue growth in the Americas geographic region, revenues for the Diagnostics segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (increasing 2% on a constant-currency basis), comprised of a 5% decrease in molecular assay products and a 6% increase in immunoassay and point-of-care lead testing products. With a 9% increase in its molecular components business and an 18% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues\n- 29 -\nfor our Life Science segment increased 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for our Life Science Segment increased 13%.\nThe fourth quarter revenues reflect improvement in our immunoassay product lines, most notably in the foodborne and H. pylori product families, being partially offset by decreased revenues in Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. Our C. difficile business overall shows signs of stabilization and as a result, has also contributed to stabilization in our illumigene molecular business. Both Life Science units performed well, reflecting the strength of new products and growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\nFiscal Year\nNet earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased 33% to $21,557, or $0.51 per diluted share, from net earnings for fiscal 2016 of $32,229, or $0.76 per diluted share. Fiscal 2017 results include (i) $762 of CEO transition and IP defense costs; and (ii) a $6,628 impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (combined impact on net earnings of $7,123, or $0.17 per diluted share). Fiscal 2016 results include $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership and $1,481 of costs associated with our acquisition activities (combined impact on net earnings of $1,664, or $0.04 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues increased 2% to $200,771 for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 3% on a constant-currency basis.\nIn fiscal 2017, revenues for the Diagnostics segment decreased 1% compared to fiscal 2016 (also 1% on a constant-currency basis). This decrease is comprised of a 13% decrease in molecular assay products and a 3% increase in immunoassay and lead testing products, including an $8,027 increase in Magellan revenues resulting from only six months of Meridian ownership during the comparable fiscal 2016 period. With an 8% increase in its molecular components business and a 15% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues of our Life Science segment increased 12% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 14% on a constant-currency basis.\nMagellan FDA Activities and Goodwill Impairment Charge\nOn May 17, 2017, the FDA issued a field safety notice advising customers to discontinue use of Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. This field safety notice was followed by product recall notices on May 25th and June 5th. Magellan's lead testing systems are capable of processing both capillary and venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra systems, which account for approximately 10% of Magellan's annual revenues, are used predominantly with venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare and LeadCare II systems are predominantly used with capillary blood samples.\nSubsequent to the issuances of these field safety and product recall notices, the FDA completed an inspection of Magellan's quality system, and issued its Form 483, Inspectional Observations, on June 29, 2017, which was expectedly followed by a Warning Letter issued on October 23, 2017. The Warning Letter requires periodic reporting on our remediation progress.\n- 30 -\nAs a result of these matters, we expect to experience delays in reinstating venous blood sample testing on our LeadCare products, as well as in obtaining 510(k) clearance for new Magellan products. We also expect delays in obtaining export certifications for Magellan products during the remediation period. In light of these factors and their impacts, during our third fiscal quarter, it was determined that a potential impairment of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Magellan had occurred (i.e., a \u201ctriggering event\u201d). With the assistance of an independent valuation firm, Magellan's fair value was calculated via both market (comparable company) and income (discounted cash flows) approaches. Based upon these approaches, it was determined that the carrying value of the Magellan reporting unit did, in fact, exceed its fair value. As a result, an impairment charge of $6,628, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, was recorded during the third quarter and is reflected as a separate operating expense line item within the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2017. Given all of the factors considered, we do not anticipate, at this time, any further goodwill impairment charge from the Magellan acquisition.\nThis impairment charge does not impact our cash flow, our dividend or our bank covenants. Our outlook for Magellan's LeadCare II testing volume continues to be healthy. In the time period since the FDA released its Safety Notification (which pertained to venous blood lead testing performed on the systems produced by Magellan), 374 new LeadCare II systems utilizing capillary blood samples have been placed in physician offices and clinics, contributing to the total number of LeadCare II placements increasing approximately 15% during fiscal 2017. These placements and ongoing placements of LeadCare II point-of-care systems and related capillary blood testing are expected to drive revenue growth in 2018 and beyond.\nThe matters giving rise to the FDA Safety Notification occurred at Magellan prior to Meridian's acquisition of Magellan. Meridian is committed to working diligently to strengthen Magellan's quality system and to address the observations noted in the Form FDA 483 with the highest sense of urgency. However, we can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful to a degree acceptable by the FDA within our contemplated time frame. It should be noted that the FDA has stated that all LeadCare blood lead testing systems can be used with capillary blood samples, the predominant sample type used by physicians testing at the point-of-care. We believe point-of-care lead testing is critical to addressing elevated lead levels among children and adults across the globe, as testing at the point-of-care improves compliance and facilitates patient education and intervention.\nBeyond the impact of the impairment charge, revenues from LeadCare Plus and Ultra, which utilize primarily venous blood samples, have decreased approximately $200 since receipt of the May 17th field safety notice. Remediation costs in fiscal 2017 associated with the matter were approximately $500 pre-tax, resulting in a total impact of less than $0.01 on diluted earnings per share for the year. Remediation costs in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $600 pre-tax, or less than $0.01 impact on diluted earnings per share. Remediation costs relate primarily to professional fees for regulatory consultants and periodic quality system audits. In the\n- 31 -\ncourse of remediation, Magellan may encounter additional matters that warrant notifications to the FDA and/or customers regarding the use of its products. At this time, we do not believe that any such notifications would impact the ability to use the LeadCare systems with capillary blood samples. In addition, at this time, we do not believe that there is any further impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe have supplemented our reported GAAP financial information with information on net earnings, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share excluding the effects of CEO transition and IP defense costs (fiscal 2017), the impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (fiscal 2017), sales & marketing leadership reorganization costs (fiscal 2016) and acquisition-related costs (fiscal 2016), each of which is a non-GAAP measure, as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>These measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the impacts of these non-routine items; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>These measures are used by our management for various purposes, including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets, comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. </td> </tr>\n</table> These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should only be used to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Geographic Region\nOur reportable segments are Diagnostics and Life Science. The Diagnostics segment consists of manufacturing operations for infectious disease diagnostic products in Cincinnati, Ohio and, as a result of the acquisition of Magellan, manufacturing operations for products detecting elevated lead levels in blood in Billerica, Massachusetts (near Boston). These diagnostic test products are sold and distributed in the countries comprising North, Central and South America (the \u201cAmericas\u201d); Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and other countries outside of the Americas and EMEA (rest of the world, or \u201cROW\u201d). The Life Science segment consists of manufacturing operations in Memphis, Tennessee; Boca Raton, Florida; London, England; Luckenwalde, Germany; and Sydney, Australia, and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad, including sales, business development, and distribution facilities in Singapore and Beijing, China to further pursue growing revenue opportunities in Asia.\nRevenues for the Diagnostics segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major distributors, seasonality and the severity of seasonal diseases and outbreaks, and foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues for the Life Science segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major customers, and foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues due to these factors.\nRevenues for each of our segments and the geographic regions therein are shown below.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

-\nFollowing is a discussion of the revenues generated by each of these product platforms/types:\nDiagnostics Products\nMolecular Assay Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our illumigene molecular platform of products totaled $33,463, representing a 13% decrease from fiscal 2016 (also 13% in constant-currency). This decrease reflects the ongoing increased competition within the molecular-based testing market, most notably within the market for C. difficile testing.\nWe have nearly 1,650 customer account placements. Of these account placements, approximately 1,375 accounts have completed evaluations and validations and are regularly purchasing product, with the balance of our account placements being in some stage of product evaluation and/or validation. Of our account placements, we have nearly 600 accounts that are regularly purchasing, evaluating and/or validating two or more assays. Increasing the number of customers utilizing two or more assays is a key objective, as we believe broader menu utilization lessens the risk of displacement by competitors.\nWe continue to invest in new product development for our molecular testing platform, and this platform now has nine commercialized tests spanning hospital acquired infections, women's health, respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, and tropical diseases. As of September 30, 2017, our illumigene Malaria test has been placed in nearly 150 accounts in the EMEA region for use as a screening test for travelers returning to Europe from endemic areas in Africa. Our efforts to develop market channels in the endemic areas of Africa continue, as we work to convince policy-makers of the advantages of a more accurate molecular test to assist in efforts to eradicate malaria.\nWe believe that the diagnostic testing market, particularly in the U.S., is continuing to selectively move away from culture and immunoassay testing to molecular testing for diseases where there is a favorable cost/benefit position for the total cost of health care. During fiscal 2017 we experienced 4% growth in all illumigene testing categories, other than the hyper-competitive C. difficile arena, which has stabilized in recent quarters. While this market is competitive, with molecular companies such as Cepheid and Becton Dickinson, and others such as Quidel, Nanosphere and Alere, we believe we are well-positioned. Our simple, easy-to-use, illumigene platform, with its expanding menu, requires no expensive equipment purchase and little to no maintenance cost. We believe these features, along with its small footprint and the performance of the illumigene assays, make illumigene an attractive molecular platform for any size hospital or physician office laboratory that runs moderately-complex tests. We continue to invest in the development of additional assays for this platform and expect a test for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), a leading cause of deafness in infants, to be our next FDA-cleared test on the illumigene platform.\n- 35 -\nImmunoassay and Lead Testing Products\nRevenues from our Diagnostics segment's immunoassay and lead testing products increased 3% in fiscal 2017, following a 1% increase in fiscal 2016. These results reflect the current fiscal year including a full twelve months of Magellan revenue, significantly offset by decreased revenue in our H. pylori and other immunoassay product lines.\nRevenues from Magellan's sale of products to test for elevated levels of lead in blood totaled $18,061. Compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, of which the six months ended March 31, 2016 were prior to Meridian's ownership of Magellan, these revenues increased 2%. This increase was achieved despite the effect on venous blood testing revenue of the previously-noted FDA-related activities.\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our H. pylori products decreased 4% (also 4% in constant-currency) to $30,948, which followed an 8% increase during fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we employed bulk-buy sales programs (also referred to as \u201cstock-and-block\u201d programs) intended to increase major customer inventory levels as a defense against potential competitors upon the expiration of our patent, as further described below. We expect our H. pylori revenue to continue to return to low single-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This growth expectation reflects volume growth from the ongoing conversion of serology testing to our antigen tests. We continue to believe there are ongoing benefits to be realized from our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting (i) the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy; (ii) changes in policies that discourage the use of traditional serology methods and promote the utilization of active infection testing methods; and (iii) physician behavior movement away from serology-based testing and toward direct antigen testing. A significant amount of the H. pylori product revenues are sales to reference labs, whose buying patterns may not be consistent from period to period. During fiscal 2017, we also introduced capabilities to identify resistance to Clarithromycin, the antibiotic commonly used to treat H. pylori. This is currently available in an Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) format. We believe that partnering the ability to diagnose H. pylori and identify resistance provides a strong competitive advantage.\nThe patents for our H. pylori products, owned by us, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our H. pylori products to increase in the near future, as we currently market the only FDA-cleared tests to detect H. pylori antigen in stool samples in the U.S. market. Such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. In order to mitigate competition, our product development pipeline includes multiple new product initiatives for the detection of H. pylori. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any mitigation strategy or that any mitigation strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of the status of certain litigation related to our intellectual property.\n- 36 -\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our other immunoassay products (including C. difficile, foodborne and respiratory) decreased 7% (also 7% in constant-currency) to $58,732, following a 16% decrease in fiscal 2016. A return to growth during the second half of the fiscal year supports our belief that this portion of our business has stabilized and is positioned for future growth (5% increase during the second half of the year, following a 16% decline in the first half of the year).\nLife Science Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our Life Science segment increased 12%, with revenues from molecular component sales increasing 8% compared to fiscal 2016 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 15%. Life Science segment revenues increased 5% in fiscal 2016, with revenues from molecular component sales remaining flat compared to fiscal 2015 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 8%. Our molecular components business' growth was negatively impacted by the movement in currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016, with revenues increasing 12% on a constant-currency basis over fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2017, our Life Science segment continued to benefit from (i) increased revenues in the steadily-expanding tropical disease product family, with sales of such products doubling to approximately $2,200 in fiscal 2017; and (ii) increased revenue from sales into China, with such sales totaling approximately $5,900 during fiscal 2017 (approximately $1,000 in the molecular components business and $4,900 in the immunoassay components business) - representing an approximate 44% increase over fiscal 2016. New products, including EPIK\u2122 miRNA Select, JetSeq\u2122, and SensiFast\u2122 Lyo-Ready, also contributed to the increase, with incremental year-over-year revenue growth of approximately $700.\nForeign Currency\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016 had an approximate $1,200 unfavorable impact on fiscal 2017 revenues; $400 within the Diagnostics segment and $800 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $1,700 unfavorable impact on revenues in fiscal 2016; $700 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,000 within the Life Science segment. Due to natural hedge relationships with expenses, both cost of sales and operating expenses, the overall impact of exchange rate fluctuations on net earnings was not significant during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nSignificant Customers\nRevenue concentrations related to certain customers within our Diagnostics and Life Science segments are set forth in Note 8 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 37 -\nMedical Device Tax\nOn January 1, 2013, the medical device tax established as part of the U.S. health care reform legislation became effective, and as a result, the Company made its first required tax deposit near the end of January 2013. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $0, $500 and $1,900, respectively, of medical device tax expense, which is reflected as a component of cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During December 2015, the Consolidations Appropriations Act of 2016 imposed a two-year moratorium on this excise tax effective January 1, 2016. This moratorium expires December 31, 2017, and we are unable to predict any future legislative changes or developments related to this moratorium or excise tax.\nGross Profit:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 vs.\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs.\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-3 points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+2 points </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The overall gross profit margin decrease during fiscal 2017 primarily results from the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly decreased contribution from our higher margin H. pylori products; (ii) customer mix; (iii) operating segment mix; and (iv) decreased production levels in certain of our production facilities designed to reduce inventory levels. The overall increase in the gross profit margin from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 reflects the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly the higher revenue contribution from H. pylori products; (ii) realization of manufacturing facility efficiencies for our illumigene products as a result of bringing in-house certain reagent dispensing operations that were previously outsourced; (iii) manufacturing efficiencies in our Life Science segment; (iv) favorable effects of currency rates related to products where the purchase cost is denominated in Euros but the customer sales are billed in U.S. dollars; and (v) decreased medical device tax payments.\nOur overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats, as well as bioresearch reagents, bulk antigens and antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and proficiency panels. Product revenue mix shifts, in the normal course of business, can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points.\n- 38 -\nOperating Expenses:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>

Details of the stock-based compensation activities giving rise to these expenses are set forth in Note 6 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 40 -\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased 27% and 8% in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above, including the Magellan goodwill impairment charge and CEO transition and IP defense costs in fiscal 2017 and the costs associated with acquisition-related activities and sales & marketing leadership reorganization in fiscal 2016.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 includes interest costs on the term loan used to fund the acquisition of Magellan. The effective interest rate on this term loan is 2.76%. In fiscal 2015, other income and expense included $1,100 of foreign currency losses, which related primarily to a foreign subsidiary intercompany loan. This compares to $400 and $600 of foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective rate for income taxes was 41%, 36% and 35% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased fiscal 2017 rate results primarily from the non-deductibility of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the effects of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 35% for fiscal 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nTo the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin, revenues or operating income in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nLiquidity\nOur cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets, debt service, consideration of acquisition plans and consideration of common share dividends. We have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities.\n- 41 -\nWe have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio, which presently consists of overnight repurchase agreements, bank savings accounts and institutional money market mutual funds. Our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to (i) preserve capital; (ii) provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions; and (iii) capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy's investment eligibility criteria. As we look forward, we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective.\nConsidering the various worldwide geo-political and geo-economic conditions (including Brexit, as more fully discussed within the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Part 1A), we do not expect macroeconomic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs, financial condition or results of operations, although no assurances can be made in this regard. We intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand. If needed, we also have an additional source of liquidity through our $30,000 bank revolving credit facility. Our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and/or liquidity and credit within the financial markets tightens for an extended period of time, and such conditions impact the collectibility of our customer accounts receivable, impact credit terms with our vendors, or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services.\nFluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of June 30th each year, and is performed at the reporting unit level. While these annual reviews to-date have not resulted in the recording of any impairments, a $6,628 impairment charge has been recorded on the goodwill resulting from the Magellan acquisition due to certain FDA activities related to Magellan's lead testing system utilizing venous blood samples (see full description previously within this MD&A). As of September 30, 2017, our stock price was $14.30 per share, compared to our book value per share of $4.02. This relationship, stock price trading at a 3.6x multiple of book value, is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for further impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nAs of September 30, 2017, our cash and equivalents balance is $9,846 higher than at the end of fiscal 2016. This increase results in large part from the combined net effects of (i) operating activities providing $4,132 more net cash, as discussed below; (ii) lowering the quarterly cash dividend rate resulting in $9,383 less in shareholder dividends being paid, as discussed below; and (iii) principal payments during the year being $2,250 higher during this first full fiscal year of the term loan obligation.\n- 42 -\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $41,355 during fiscal 2017, an 11% increase from the $37,223 provided during fiscal 2016. While reflecting the effects of the timing of payments from customers, and to suppliers and taxing authorities, this increase also results in large part from the net effects of (i) decreased inventory levels during fiscal 2017, compared to increased levels during fiscal 2016; and (ii) decreased accrued employee compensation costs during fiscal 2017, reflecting the payment of $407 of discretionary bonuses to non-executives related to fiscal 2016 and the timing of regularly scheduled payroll payments. Net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividends during the next 12 months.\nFollowing the release of results for the fiscal 2017 first quarter, the board of directors reduced the fiscal 2017 indicated annual cash dividend rate to $0.50 per share (down from $0.80 per share) in order to align it with the stated policy guidelines of the payout ratio to range between 75% and 85% of each fiscal year's net earnings. This indicated annual rate represents 75% of fiscal 2017's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nCapital Resources\nIn connection with the acquisition of Magellan, the Company entered into a $60,000 five-year term loan and related interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank, the details of which are set forth in Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have a $30,000 revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that expires March 31, 2021. As of November 29, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility and we had 100% borrowing capacity available to us. We have had no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $4,467 for fiscal 2017 and largely related to laboratory equipment, manufacturing equipment and a new business intelligence system. During fiscal 2018 our capital expenditures are estimated to range between approximately $4,000 to $5,000, with the actual amount dependent upon actual operating results and the phasing of certain projects. Such expenditures may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand, operating cash flows and/or availability under the $30,000 revolving credit facility discussed above.\n- 43 -\nKnown Contractual Obligations:\nKnown contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of September 30, 2017:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1\nYear </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan principal payments (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Scheduled interest payments (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain income tax positions liability and interest (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of (i) office and warehouse buildings in Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Singapore, China and the U.K.; (ii) automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the U.S. and Europe; and (iii) certain office equipment such as facsimile and copier machines across all business units, under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Purchase obligations relate primarily to outstanding purchase orders for inventory, including instruments, service items, and research and development activities.

Approximately 90% of our royalty expenses relate to our Diagnostics operating segment, where the royalty rates range from 4% to 8%. Meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to approximately $2,500 in fiscal 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not utilize special-purpose financing vehicles or have undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements.\n- 44 -\nMarket Risk Exposure:\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions from our operations outside the United States, as well as certain suppliers to our domestic businesses located outside the United States. The foreign currencies where we have market risk exposure are the Australian dollar, British pound, Chinese yuan, Euro and Singapore dollar. Assessing foreign currency exposures is a component of our overall ongoing risk management process, with such currency risks managed as we deem appropriate.\nConcentration of Customers/Products Risk\nOur Diagnostics segment's revenues from sales through two U.S. distributors were 29% of the segment's total revenues or 21% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2017. Additionally, five of our product families accounted for 81% of our Diagnostics segment's third-party revenues during fiscal 2017, and 58% of our fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues.\nOur Life Science segment's revenues from sales of purified antigens and reagents to two diagnostics manufacturing customers were 17% of the segment's total revenues for fiscal 2017, and 5% of our fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies:\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Listed below are the accounting policies management believes to be critical to understanding the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, along with reference to location of the policy discussion within the accompanying financial statements. The listed policies are considered critical due to the fact that application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material.\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounting Policy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Location\nWithin Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Examples of Key Estimate Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Inventories </td> <td> </td> <td>Note 1(f) </td> <td> </td> <td>Slow-moving, excess & obsolete inventories </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Intangible Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Note 1(h) </td> <td> </td> <td>Triggering events and impairment conditions </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue Recognition </td> <td> </td> <td>Note 1(i) </td> <td> </td> <td>Distributor price adjustments and fee accruals </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income Taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>Note 1(k) and Note 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Uncertain tax positions and state apportionment factors </td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 45 -\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes and replaces nearly all currently-existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance including related disclosure requirements. This guidance, including any clarification guidance thereon, will be effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). The Company has prepared an inventory of its existing revenue streams and a preliminary analysis of the revenue recognition criteria applying ASU 2014-09. This analysis is preliminary and our overall assessment is not yet complete. However, based on the analysis completed to date, aside from certain expanded disclosure requirements, the Company does not currently anticipate that its planned adoption of ASU 2014-09 on a modified retrospective basis will have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which amends the accounting guidance related to leases. These changes, which are designed to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for both lessees and lessors, include, among other things, requiring recognition of lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Adoption and implementation of the guidance is not required by the Company until the beginning of fiscal 2020, although early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to begin its assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements in fiscal 2018.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends the accounting for share-based payment transactions. These changes, which are designed for simplification, involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Adoption and implementation of the guidance is not required by the Company until the beginning of fiscal 2018, although early adoption is permitted. The Company has assessed the impact that adoption of this guidance will have, and believes that the impact will primarily relate to the treatment of the differences between stock compensation expense recorded in the Company's financial statements and the stock compensation ultimately deducted on its tax returns. The tax effect of such differences is currently recorded in additional paid-in capital and reflected within the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. Upon adoption of this guidance, these tax effects will be required to be recorded directly to income tax expense and reflected within the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. While the impact of this guidance, which the Company plans to adopt on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2018, is dependent on numerous factors (e.g., the market price of the Company's common stock on the equity award grant date, the exercise/lapse dates of equity awards, and the market price of the Company's common stock on such exercise/lapse dates), based on the lapsing of a significant equity grant in November 2017, adoption is expected to increase the Company's fiscal 2018 effective tax rate by approximately one percentage point.\n- 46 -\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update addresses certain specific cash flows and their treatment, with the objective being to reduce the existing diversity in how the items are presented and classified within the statement of cash flows. Adoption and implementation of the guidance is not required by the Company until the beginning of fiscal 2019, although early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's statement of cash flows.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which intends to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. Adoption and implementation of the guidance is not required by the Company until the beginning of fiscal 2019, although early adoption is permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements, in light of the levels of such transfer activity within the Company, adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which serves to simplify the process of testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating the \u201cStep 2\u201d comparison of a reporting unit's implied fair value to its carrying amount. The guidance requires an entity to compare a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount, and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment equal to the excess carrying amount is recorded; no Step 2 implied fair value comparison is required. The Company early adopted this guidance during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, as permitted. See Note 1(h) for discussion of Magellan's goodwill impairment.", "summary": "- The provided JSON contains information about fictional television shows and their ratings across seasons and

7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRefer to \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d following the Index in front of this Form 10-K and Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d on Pages 15 through 26 of this Annual Report.\nIn the discussion that follows, all dollar amounts are in thousands (both tables and text), except per share data.\nResults of Operations:\nFourth Quarter\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 4% to $5,726, or $0.13 per diluted share, from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 of $5,491, or $0.13 per diluted share. The fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results include $762 of costs associated with the transition to our new CEO, announced October 10, 2017, and litigation costs associated with protecting certain intellectual property (collectively, \u201cCEO transition and IP defense costs\u201d) (impact on net earnings of $495, or $0.01 per diluted share). The fiscal 2016 fourth quarter results included $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership (impact on net earnings of $431, or $0.01 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $49,697, an increase of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; increasing 5% on a constant-currency basis.\nShowing positive signs of stabilization and a return to revenue growth in the Americas geographic region, revenues for the Diagnostics segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (increasing 2% on a constant-currency basis), comprised of a 5% decrease in molecular assay products and a 6% increase in immunoassay and point-of-care lead testing products. With a 9% increase in its molecular components business and an 18% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues\n- 29 -\nfor our Life Science segment increased 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for our Life Science Segment increased 13%.\nThe fourth quarter revenues reflect improvement in our immunoassay product lines, most notably in the foodborne and H. pylori product families, being partially offset by decreased revenues in Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. Our C. difficile business overall shows signs of stabilization and as a result, has also contributed to stabilization in our illumigene molecular business. Both Life Science units performed well, reflecting the strength of new products and growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\nFiscal Year\nNet earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased 33% to $21,557, or $0.51 per diluted share, from net earnings for fiscal 2016 of $32,229, or $0.76 per diluted share. Fiscal 2017 results include (i) $762 of CEO transition and IP defense costs; and (ii) a $6,628 impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (combined impact on net earnings of $7,123, or $0.17 per diluted share). Fiscal 2016 results include $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership and $1,481 of costs associated with our acquisition activities (combined impact on net earnings of $1,664, or $0.04 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues increased 2% to $200,771 for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 3% on a constant-currency basis.\nIn fiscal 2017, revenues for the Diagnostics segment decreased 1% compared to fiscal 2016 (also 1% on a constant-currency basis). This decrease is comprised of a 13% decrease in molecular assay products and a 3% increase in immunoassay and lead testing products, including an $8,027 increase in Magellan revenues resulting from only six months of Meridian ownership during the comparable fiscal 2016 period. With an 8% increase in its molecular components business and a 15% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues of our Life Science segment increased 12% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 14% on a constant-currency basis.\nMagellan FDA Activities and Goodwill Impairment Charge\nOn May 17, 2017, the FDA issued a field safety notice advising customers to discontinue use of Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. This field safety notice was followed by product recall notices on May 25th and June 5th. Magellan's lead testing systems are capable of processing both capillary and venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra systems, which account for approximately 10% of Magellan's annual revenues, are used predominantly with venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare and LeadCare II systems are predominantly used with capillary blood samples.\nSubsequent to the issuances of these field safety and product recall notices, the FDA completed an inspection of Magellan's quality system, and issued its Form 483, Inspectional Observations, on June 29, 2017, which was expectedly followed by a Warning Letter issued on October 23, 2017. The Warning Letter requires periodic reporting on our remediation progress.\n- 30 -\nAs a result of these matters, we expect to experience delays in reinstating venous blood sample testing on our LeadCare products, as well as in obtaining 510(k) clearance for new Magellan products. We also expect delays in obtaining export certifications for Magellan products during the remediation period. In light of these factors and their impacts, during our third fiscal quarter, it was determined that a potential impairment of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Magellan had occurred (i.e., a \u201ctriggering event\u201d). With the assistance of an independent valuation firm, Magellan's fair value was calculated via both market (comparable company) and income (discounted cash flows) approaches. Based upon these approaches, it was determined that the carrying value of the Magellan reporting unit did, in fact, exceed its fair value. As a result, an impairment charge of $6,628, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, was recorded during the third quarter and is reflected as a separate operating expense line item within the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2017. Given all of the factors considered, we do not anticipate, at this time, any further goodwill impairment charge from the Magellan acquisition.\nThis impairment charge does not impact our cash flow, our dividend or our bank covenants. Our outlook for Magellan's LeadCare II testing volume continues to be healthy. In the time period since the FDA released its Safety Notification (which pertained to venous blood lead testing performed on the systems produced by Magellan), 374 new LeadCare II systems utilizing capillary blood samples have been placed in physician offices and clinics, contributing to the total number of LeadCare II placements increasing approximately 15% during fiscal 2017. These placements and ongoing placements of LeadCare II point-of-care systems and related capillary blood testing are expected to drive revenue growth in 2018 and beyond.\nThe matters giving rise to the FDA Safety Notification occurred at Magellan prior to Meridian's acquisition of Magellan. Meridian is committed to working diligently to strengthen Magellan's quality system and to address the observations noted in the Form FDA 483 with the highest sense of urgency. However, we can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful to a degree acceptable by the FDA within our contemplated time frame. It should be noted that the FDA has stated that all LeadCare blood lead testing systems can be used with capillary blood samples, the predominant sample type used by physicians testing at the point-of-care. We believe point-of-care lead testing is critical to addressing elevated lead levels among children and adults across the globe, as testing at the point-of-care improves compliance and facilitates patient education and intervention.\nBeyond the impact of the impairment charge, revenues from LeadCare Plus and Ultra, which utilize primarily venous blood samples, have decreased approximately $200 since receipt of the May 17th field safety notice. Remediation costs in fiscal 2017 associated with the matter were approximately $500 pre-tax, resulting in a total impact of less than $0.01 on diluted earnings per share for the year. Remediation costs in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $600 pre-tax, or less than $0.01 impact on diluted earnings per share. Remediation costs relate primarily to professional fees for regulatory consultants and periodic quality system audits. In the\n- 31 -\ncourse of remediation, Magellan may encounter additional matters that warrant notifications to the FDA and/or customers regarding the use of its products. At this time, we do not believe that any such notifications would impact the ability to use the LeadCare systems with capillary blood samples. In addition, at this time, we do not believe that there is any further impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe have supplemented our reported GAAP financial information with information on net earnings, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share excluding the effects of CEO transition and IP defense costs (fiscal 2017), the impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (fiscal 2017), sales & marketing leadership reorganization costs (fiscal 2016) and acquisition-related costs (fiscal 2016), each of which is a non-GAAP measure, as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because:\n 1. These measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the impacts of these non-routine items; and \n 2. These measures are used by our management for various purposes, including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets, comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.  These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should only be used to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\n\n (1) These CEO transition and IP defense costs, sales & marketing leadership reorganization costs, and acquisition-related costs are net of income tax effects of $267, $246 and $248, respectively, which were calculated using the effective tax rates of the jurisdictions in which the costs were incurred. (2) Since the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes, there are no income tax effects. (3) Net Earnings per Diluted Common Share for fiscal 2017 does not sum to the total Adjusted Diluted EPS due to rounding. \n- 32 -\nREVENUE OVERVIEW\nBelow are analyses of the Company's revenue, provided for each of the following:\n \u2022 By Reportable Segment & Geographic Region \n \u2022 By Product Platform/Type  Revenue Overview- By Reportable Segment & Geographic Region\nOur reportable segments are Diagnostics and Life Science. The Diagnostics segment consists of manufacturing operations for infectious disease diagnostic products in Cincinnati, Ohio and, as a result of the acquisition of Magellan, manufacturing operations for products detecting elevated lead levels in blood in Billerica, Massachusetts (near Boston). These diagnostic test products are sold and distributed in the countries comprising North, Central and South America (the \u201cAmericas\u201d); Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and other countries outside of the Americas and EMEA (rest of the world, or \u201cROW\u201d). The Life Science segment consists of manufacturing operations in Memphis, Tennessee; Boca Raton, Florida; London, England; Luckenwalde, Germany; and Sydney, Australia, and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad, including sales, business development, and distribution facilities in Singapore and Beijing, China to further pursue growing revenue opportunities in Asia.\nRevenues for the Diagnostics segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major distributors, seasonality and the severity of seasonal diseases and outbreaks, and foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues for the Life Science segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major customers, and foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues due to these factors.\nRevenues for each of our segments and the geographic regions therein are shown below.\n\n- 33 -\nRevenue Overview- By Product Platform/Type\nThe revenues generated by each of our reportable segments result primarily from the sale of the following segment-specific categories of products:\nDiagnostics\n 1) Molecular assays that operate on our illumigene platform \n 2) Immunoassays and lead tests on multiple technology platforms  Life Science\n 1) Molecular components \n 2) Immunoassay components  Revenues for each product platform/type, as well as its relative percentage of segment revenues, are shown below.\n\n- 34 -\nFollowing is a discussion of the revenues generated by each of these product platforms/types:\nDiagnostics Products\nMolecular Assay Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our illumigene molecular platform of products totaled $33,463, representing a 13% decrease from fiscal 2016 (also 13% in constant-currency). This decrease reflects the ongoing increased competition within the molecular-based testing market, most notably within the market for C. difficile testing.\nWe have nearly 1,650 customer account placements. Of these account placements, approximately 1,375 accounts have completed evaluations and validations and are regularly purchasing product, with the balance of our account placements being in some stage of product evaluation and/or validation. Of our account placements, we have nearly 600 accounts that are regularly purchasing, evaluating and/or validating two or more assays. Increasing the number of customers utilizing two or more assays is a key objective, as we believe broader menu utilization lessens the risk of displacement by competitors.\nWe continue to invest in new product development for our molecular testing platform, and this platform now has nine commercialized tests spanning hospital acquired infections, women's health, respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, and tropical diseases. As of September 30, 2017, our illumigene Malaria test has been placed in nearly 150 accounts in the EMEA region for use as a screening test for travelers returning to Europe from endemic areas in Africa. Our efforts to develop market channels in the endemic areas of Africa continue, as we work to convince policy-makers of the advantages of a more accurate molecular test to assist in efforts to eradicate malaria.\nWe believe that the diagnostic testing market, particularly in the U.S., is continuing to selectively move away from culture and immunoassay testing to molecular testing for diseases where there is a favorable cost/benefit position for the total cost of health care. During fiscal 2017 we experienced 4% growth in all illumigene testing categories, other than the hyper-competitive C. difficile arena, which has stabilized in recent quarters. While this market is competitive, with molecular companies such as Cepheid and Becton Dickinson, and others such as Quidel, Nanosphere and Alere, we believe we are well-positioned. Our simple, easy-to-use, illumigene platform, with its expanding menu, requires no expensive equipment purchase and little to no maintenance cost. We believe these features, along with its small footprint and the performance of the illumigene assays, make illumigene an attractive molecular platform for any size hospital or physician office laboratory that runs moderately-complex tests. We continue to invest in the development of additional assays for this platform and expect a test for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), a leading cause of deafness in infants, to be our next FDA-cleared test on the illumigene platform.\n- 35 -\nImmunoassay and Lead Testing Products\nRevenues from our Diagnostics segment's immunoassay and lead testing products increased 3% in fiscal 2017, following a 1% increase in fiscal 2016. These results reflect the current fiscal year including a full twelve months of Magellan revenue, significantly offset by decreased revenue in our H. pylori and other immunoassay product lines.\nRevenues from Magellan's sale of products to test for elevated levels of lead in blood totaled $18,061. Compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, of which the six months ended March 31, 2016 were prior to Meridian's ownership of Magellan, these revenues increased 2%. This increase was achieved despite the effect on venous blood testing revenue of the previously-noted FDA-related activities.\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our H. pylori products decreased 4% (also 4% in constant-currency) to $30,948, which followed an 8% increase during fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we employed bulk-buy sales programs (also referred to as \u201cstock-and-block\u201d programs) intended to increase major customer inventory levels as a defense against potential competitors upon the expiration of our patent, as further described below. We expect our H. pylori revenue to continue to return to low single-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This growth expectation reflects volume growth from the ongoing conversion of serology testing to our antigen tests. We continue to believe there are ongoing benefits to be realized from our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting (i) the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy; (ii) changes in policies that discourage the use of traditional serology methods and promote the utilization of active infection testing methods; and (iii) physician behavior movement away from serology-based testing and toward direct antigen testing. A significant amount of the H. pylori product revenues are sales to reference labs, whose buying patterns may not be consistent from period to period. During fiscal 2017, we also introduced capabilities to identify resistance to Clarithromycin, the antibiotic commonly used to treat H. pylori. This is currently available in an Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) format. We believe that partnering the ability to diagnose H. pylori and identify resistance provides a strong competitive advantage.\nThe patents for our H. pylori products, owned by us, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our H. pylori products to increase in the near future, as we currently market the only FDA-cleared tests to detect H. pylori antigen in stool samples in the U.S. market. Such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. In order to mitigate competition, our product development pipeline includes multiple new product initiatives for the detection of H. pylori. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any mitigation strategy or that any mitigation strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of the status of certain litigation related to our intellectual property.\n- 36 -\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our other immunoassay products (including C. difficile, foodborne and respiratory) decreased 7% (also 7% in constant-currency) to $58,732, following a 16% decrease in fiscal 2016. A return to growth during the second half of the fiscal year supports our belief that this portion of our business has stabilized and is positioned for future growth (5% increase during the second half of the year, following a 16% decline in the first half of the year).\nLife Science Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our Life Science segment increased 12%, with revenues from molecular component sales increasing 8% compared to fiscal 2016 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 15%. Life Science segment revenues increased 5% in fiscal 2016, with revenues from molecular component sales remaining flat compared to fiscal 2015 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 8%. Our molecular components business' growth was negatively impacted by the movement in currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016, with revenues increasing 12% on a constant-currency basis over fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2017, our Life Science segment continued to benefit from (i) increased revenues in the steadily-expanding tropical disease product family, with sales of such products doubling to approximately $2,200 in fiscal 2017; and (ii) increased revenue from sales into China, with such sales totaling approximately $5,900 during fiscal 2017 (approximately $1,000 in the molecular components business and $4,900 in the immunoassay components business) - representing an approximate 44% increase over fiscal 2016. New products, including EPIK\u2122 miRNA Select, JetSeq\u2122, and SensiFast\u2122 Lyo-Ready, also contributed to the increase, with incremental year-over-year revenue growth of approximately $700.\nForeign Currency\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016 had an approximate $1,200 unfavorable impact on fiscal 2017 revenues; $400 within the Diagnostics segment and $800 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $1,700 unfavorable impact on revenues in fiscal 2016; $700 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,000 within the Life Science segment. Due to natural hedge relationships with expenses, both cost of sales and operating expenses, the overall impact of exchange rate fluctuations on net earnings was not significant during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nSignificant Customers\nRevenue concentrations related to certain customers within our Diagnostics and Life Science segments are set forth in Note 8 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 37 -\nMedical Device Tax\nOn January 1, 2013, the medical device tax established as part of the U.S. health care reform legislation became effective, and as a result, the Company made its first required tax deposit near the end of January 2013. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $0, $500 and $1,900, respectively, of medical device tax expense, which is reflected as a component of cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During December 2015, the Consolidations Appropriations Act of 2016 imposed a two-year moratorium on this excise tax effective January 1, 2016. This moratorium expires December 31, 2017, and we are unable to predict any future legislative changes or developments related to this moratorium or excise tax.\nGross Profit:\n The overall gross profit margin decrease during fiscal 2017 primarily results from the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly decreased contribution from our higher margin H. pylori products; (ii) customer mix; (iii) operating segment mix; and (iv) decreased production levels in certain of our production facilities designed to reduce inventory levels. The overall increase in the gross profit margin from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 reflects the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly the higher revenue contribution from H. pylori products; (ii) realization of manufacturing facility efficiencies for our illumigene products as a result of bringing in-house certain reagent dispensing operations that were previously outsourced; (iii) manufacturing efficiencies in our Life Science segment; (iv) favorable effects of currency rates related to products where the purchase cost is denominated in Euros but the customer sales are billed in U.S. dollars; and (v) decreased medical device tax payments.\nOur overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats, as well as bioresearch reagents, bulk antigens and antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and proficiency panels. Product revenue mix shifts, in the normal course of business, can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points.\n- 38 -\nOperating Expenses:\n\n- 39 -\nTotal operating expenses increased during both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, resulting primarily from the combined effects of the following:\nDiagnostics\nFiscal 2017 increase\n \u2022 Magellan goodwill impairment charge; \n \u2022 Incremental Magellan operating expenses due to six additional months of Meridian ownership in fiscal 2017; \n \u2022 Increased R&D costs in connection with instrumentation development programs, with such elevated level of spending expected to continue into fiscal 2018 as the programs are completed and transitioned to clinical trials; and \n \u2022 CEO transition and IP defense costs.  Fiscal 2016 increase\n \u2022 Addition of Magellan's operating expenses since the March 24, 2016 date of acquisition, which represent approximately 50% of the total Diagnostics operating expense increase; \n \u2022 Increased investment in Sales & Marketing activities, including new leadership and an expansion in sales territories; \n \u2022 Costs incurred in connection with acquisition activities, most notably related to the acquisition of Magellan; and \n \u2022 Costs incurred in connection with restructuring Sales & Marketing leadership, which relate to severance obligations for former employees. \nLife Science\nFiscal 2017 increase\n \u2022 Increased investment in Sales & Marketing activities, including costs associated with the WFOE established in Beijing, China during fiscal 2017. \nFiscal 2016 increase\n \u2022 Increased investment in Sales & Marketing activities, including increased personnel, travel and marketing spending. \nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense reported for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $3,381, $2,911 and $3,324, respectively. Details of the stock-based compensation activities giving rise to these expenses are set forth in Note 6 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 40 -\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased 27% and 8% in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above, including the Magellan goodwill impairment charge and CEO transition and IP defense costs in fiscal 2017 and the costs associated with acquisition-related activities and sales & marketing leadership reorganization in fiscal 2016.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 includes interest costs on the term loan used to fund the acquisition of Magellan. The effective interest rate on this term loan is 2.76%. In fiscal 2015, other income and expense included $1,100 of foreign currency losses, which related primarily to a foreign subsidiary intercompany loan. This compares to $400 and $600 of foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective rate for income taxes was 41%, 36% and 35% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased fiscal 2017 rate results primarily from the non-deductibility of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the effects of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 35% for fiscal 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nTo the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin, revenues or operating income in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nLiquidity\nOur cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets, debt service, consideration of acquisition plans and consideration of common share dividends. We have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities.\n- 41 -\nWe have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio, which presently consists of overnight repurchase agreements, bank savings accounts and institutional money market mutual funds. Our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to (i) preserve capital; (ii) provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions; and (iii) capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy's investment eligibility criteria. As we look forward, we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective.\nConsidering the various worldwide geo-political and geo-economic conditions (including Brexit, as more fully discussed within the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Part 1A), we do not expect macroeconomic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs, financial condition or results of operations, although no assurances can be made in this regard. We intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand. If needed, we also have an additional source of liquidity through our $30,000 bank revolving credit facility. Our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and/or liquidity and credit within the financial markets tightens for an extended period of time, and such conditions impact the collectibility of our customer accounts receivable, impact credit terms with our vendors, or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services.\nFluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of June 30th each year, and is performed at the reporting unit level. While these annual reviews to-date have not resulted in the recording of any impairments, a $6,628 impairment charge has been recorded on the goodwill resulting from the Magellan acquisition due to certain FDA activities related to Magellan's lead testing system utilizing venous blood samples (see full description previously within this MD&A). As of September 30, 2017, our stock price was $14.30 per share, compared to our book value per share of $4.02. This relationship, stock price trading at a 3.6x multiple of book value, is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for further impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nAs of September 30, 2017, our cash and equivalents balance is $9,846 higher than at the end of fiscal 2016. This increase results in large part from the combined net effects of (i) operating activities providing $4,132 more net cash, as discussed below; (ii) lowering the quarterly cash dividend rate resulting in $9,383 less in shareholder dividends being paid, as discussed below; and (iii) principal payments during the year being $2,250 higher during this first full fiscal year of the term loan obligation.\n- 42 -\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $41,355 during fiscal 2017, an 11% increase from the $37,223 provided during fiscal 2016. While reflecting the effects of the timing of payments from customers, and to suppliers and taxing authorities, this increase also results in large part from the net effects of (i) decreased inventory levels during fiscal 2017, compared to increased levels during fiscal 2016; and (ii) decreased accrued employee compensation costs during fiscal 2017, reflecting the payment of $407 of discretionary bonuses to non-executives related to fiscal 2016 and the timing of regularly scheduled payroll payments. Net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividends during the next 12 months.\nFollowing the release of results for the fiscal 2017 first quarter, the board of directors reduced the fiscal 2017 indicated annual cash dividend rate to $0.50 per share (down from $0.80 per share) in order to align it with the stated policy guidelines of the payout ratio to range between 75% and 85% of each fiscal year's net earnings. This indicated annual rate represents 75% of fiscal 2017's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nCapital Resources\nIn connection with the acquisition of Magellan, the Company entered into a $60,000 five-year term loan and related interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank, the details of which are set forth in Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have a $30,000 revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that expires March 31, 2021. As of November 29, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRefer to \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d following the Index in front of this Form 10-K and Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d on Pages 15 through 26 of this Annual Report.\nIn the discussion that follows, all dollar amounts are in thousands (both tables and text), except per share data.\nResults of Operations:\nFourth Quarter\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 4% to $5,726, or $0.13 per diluted share, from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 of $5,491, or $0.13 per diluted share. The fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results include $762 of costs associated with the transition to our new CEO, announced October 10, 2017, and litigation costs associated with protecting certain intellectual property (collectively, \u201cCEO transition and IP defense costs\u201d) (impact on net earnings of $495, or $0.01 per diluted share). The fiscal 2016 fourth quarter results included $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership (impact on net earnings of $431, or $0.01 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $49,697, an increase of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; increasing 5% on a constant-currency basis.\nShowing positive signs of stabilization and a return to revenue growth in the Americas geographic region, revenues for the Diagnostics segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (increasing 2% on a constant-currency basis), comprised of a 5% decrease in molecular assay products and a 6% increase in immunoassay and point-of-care lead testing products. With a 9% increase in its molecular components business and an 18% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues\n- 29 -\nfor our Life Science segment increased 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for our Life Science Segment increased 13%.\nThe fourth quarter revenues reflect improvement in our immunoassay product lines, most notably in the foodborne and H. pylori product families, being partially offset by decreased revenues in Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. Our C. difficile business overall shows signs of stabilization and as a result, has also contributed to stabilization in our illumigene molecular business. Both Life Science units performed well, reflecting the strength of new products and growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\nFiscal Year\nNet earnings for fiscal 2017 decreased 33% to $21,557, or $0.51 per diluted share, from net earnings for fiscal 2016 of $32,229, or $0.76 per diluted share. Fiscal 2017 results include (i) $762 of CEO transition and IP defense costs; and (ii) a $6,628 impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (combined impact on net earnings of $7,123, or $0.17 per diluted share). Fiscal 2016 results include $677 of costs associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing leadership and $1,481 of costs associated with our acquisition activities (combined impact on net earnings of $1,664, or $0.04 per diluted share). Consolidated revenues increased 2% to $200,771 for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 3% on a constant-currency basis.\nIn fiscal 2017, revenues for the Diagnostics segment decreased 1% compared to fiscal 2016 (also 1% on a constant-currency basis). This decrease is comprised of a 13% decrease in molecular assay products and a 3% increase in immunoassay and lead testing products, including an $8,027 increase in Magellan revenues resulting from only six months of Meridian ownership during the comparable fiscal 2016 period. With an 8% increase in its molecular components business and a 15% increase in its immunoassay components business, revenues of our Life Science segment increased 12% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016; increasing 14% on a constant-currency basis.\nMagellan FDA Activities and Goodwill Impairment Charge\nOn May 17, 2017, the FDA issued a field safety notice advising customers to discontinue use of Magellan's lead testing systems with venous blood samples. This field safety notice was followed by product recall notices on May 25th and June 5th. Magellan's lead testing systems are capable of processing both capillary and venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra systems, which account for approximately 10% of Magellan's annual revenues, are used predominantly with venous blood samples. Magellan's LeadCare and LeadCare II systems are predominantly used with capillary blood samples.\nSubsequent to the issuances of these field safety and product recall notices, the FDA completed an inspection of Magellan's quality system, and issued its Form 483, Inspectional Observations, on June 29, 2017, which was expectedly followed by a Warning Letter issued on October 23, 2017. The Warning Letter requires periodic reporting on our remediation progress.\n- 30 -\nAs a result of these matters, we expect to experience delays in reinstating venous blood sample testing on our LeadCare products, as well as in obtaining 510(k) clearance for new Magellan products. We also expect delays in obtaining export certifications for Magellan products during the remediation period. In light of these factors and their impacts, during our third fiscal quarter, it was determined that a potential impairment of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Magellan had occurred (i.e., a \u201ctriggering event\u201d). With the assistance of an independent valuation firm, Magellan's fair value was calculated via both market (comparable company) and income (discounted cash flows) approaches. Based upon these approaches, it was determined that the carrying value of the Magellan reporting unit did, in fact, exceed its fair value. As a result, an impairment charge of $6,628, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, was recorded during the third quarter and is reflected as a separate operating expense line item within the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2017. Given all of the factors considered, we do not anticipate, at this time, any further goodwill impairment charge from the Magellan acquisition.\nThis impairment charge does not impact our cash flow, our dividend or our bank covenants. Our outlook for Magellan's LeadCare II testing volume continues to be healthy. In the time period since the FDA released its Safety Notification (which pertained to venous blood lead testing performed on the systems produced by Magellan), 374 new LeadCare II systems utilizing capillary blood samples have been placed in physician offices and clinics, contributing to the total number of LeadCare II placements increasing approximately 15% during fiscal 2017. These placements and ongoing placements of LeadCare II point-of-care systems and related capillary blood testing are expected to drive revenue growth in 2018 and beyond.\nThe matters giving rise to the FDA Safety Notification occurred at Magellan prior to Meridian's acquisition of Magellan. Meridian is committed to working diligently to strengthen Magellan's quality system and to address the observations noted in the Form FDA 483 with the highest sense of urgency. However, we can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful to a degree acceptable by the FDA within our contemplated time frame. It should be noted that the FDA has stated that all LeadCare blood lead testing systems can be used with capillary blood samples, the predominant sample type used by physicians testing at the point-of-care. We believe point-of-care lead testing is critical to addressing elevated lead levels among children and adults across the globe, as testing at the point-of-care improves compliance and facilitates patient education and intervention.\nBeyond the impact of the impairment charge, revenues from LeadCare Plus and Ultra, which utilize primarily venous blood samples, have decreased approximately $200 since receipt of the May 17th field safety notice. Remediation costs in fiscal 2017 associated with the matter were approximately $500 pre-tax, resulting in a total impact of less than $0.01 on diluted earnings per share for the year. Remediation costs in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $600 pre-tax, or less than $0.01 impact on diluted earnings per share. Remediation costs relate primarily to professional fees for regulatory consultants and periodic quality system audits. In the\n- 31 -\ncourse of remediation, Magellan may encounter additional matters that warrant notifications to the FDA and/or customers regarding the use of its products. At this time, we do not believe that any such notifications would impact the ability to use the LeadCare systems with capillary blood samples. In addition, at this time, we do not believe that there is any further impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe have supplemented our reported GAAP financial information with information on net earnings, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share excluding the effects of CEO transition and IP defense costs (fiscal 2017), the impairment charge against Magellan goodwill (fiscal 2017), sales & marketing leadership reorganization costs (fiscal 2016) and acquisition-related costs (fiscal 2016), each of which is a non-GAAP measure, as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because:\n 1. These measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the impacts of these non-routine items; and \n 2. These measures are used by our management for various purposes, including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets, comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.  These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should only be used to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

transition and IP defense costs, sales & marketing leadership reorganization costs, and acquisition-related costs are net of income tax effects of $267, $246 and $248, respectively, which were calculated using the effective tax rates of the jurisdictions in which the costs were incurred. (2) Since the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes, there are no income tax effects. (3) Net Earnings per Diluted Common Share for fiscal 2017 does not sum to the total Adjusted Diluted EPS due to rounding. \n- 32 -\nREVENUE OVERVIEW\nBelow are analyses of the Company's revenue, provided for each of the following:\n \u2022 By Reportable Segment & Geographic Region \n \u2022 By Product Platform/Type  Revenue Overview- By Reportable Segment & Geographic Region\nOur reportable segments are Diagnostics and Life Science. The Diagnostics segment consists of manufacturing operations for infectious disease diagnostic products in Cincinnati, Ohio and, as a result of the acquisition of Magellan, manufacturing operations for products detecting elevated lead levels in blood in Billerica, Massachusetts (near Boston). These diagnostic test products are sold and distributed in the countries comprising North, Central and South America (the \u201cAmericas\u201d); Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and other countries outside of the Americas and EMEA (rest of the world, or \u201cROW\u201d). The Life Science segment consists of manufacturing operations in Memphis, Tennessee; Boca Raton, Florida; London, England; Luckenwalde, Germany; and Sydney, Australia, and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad, including sales, business development, and distribution facilities in Singapore and Beijing, China to further pursue growing revenue opportunities in Asia.\nRevenues for the Diagnostics segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major distributors, seasonality and the severity of seasonal diseases and outbreaks, and foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues for the Life Science segment, in the normal course of business, may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major customers, and foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues due to these factors.\nRevenues for each of our segments and the geographic regions therein are shown below.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the revenues generated by each of these product platforms/types:\nDiagnostics Products\nMolecular Assay Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our illumigene molecular platform of products totaled $33,463, representing a 13% decrease from fiscal 2016 (also 13% in constant-currency). This decrease reflects the ongoing increased competition within the molecular-based testing market, most notably within the market for C. difficile testing.\nWe have nearly 1,650 customer account placements. Of these account placements, approximately 1,375 accounts have completed evaluations and validations and are regularly purchasing product, with the balance of our account placements being in some stage of product evaluation and/or validation. Of our account placements, we have nearly 600 accounts that are regularly purchasing, evaluating and/or validating two or more assays. Increasing the number of customers utilizing two or more assays is a key objective, as we believe broader menu utilization lessens the risk of displacement by competitors.\nWe continue to invest in new product development for our molecular testing platform, and this platform now has nine commercialized tests spanning hospital acquired infections, women's health, respiratory, sexually transmitted diseases, and tropical diseases. As of September 30, 2017, our illumigene Malaria test has been placed in nearly 150 accounts in the EMEA region for use as a screening test for travelers returning to Europe from endemic areas in Africa. Our efforts to develop market channels in the endemic areas of Africa continue, as we work to convince policy-makers of the advantages of a more accurate molecular test to assist in efforts to eradicate malaria.\nWe believe that the diagnostic testing market, particularly in the U.S., is continuing to selectively move away from culture and immunoassay testing to molecular testing for diseases where there is a favorable cost/benefit position for the total cost of health care. During fiscal 2017 we experienced 4% growth in all illumigene testing categories, other than the hyper-competitive C. difficile arena, which has stabilized in recent quarters. While this market is competitive, with molecular companies such as Cepheid and Becton Dickinson, and others such as Quidel, Nanosphere and Alere, we believe we are well-positioned. Our simple, easy-to-use, illumigene platform, with its expanding menu, requires no expensive equipment purchase and little to no maintenance cost. We believe these features, along with its small footprint and the performance of the illumigene assays, make illumigene an attractive molecular platform for any size hospital or physician office laboratory that runs moderately-complex tests. We continue to invest in the development of additional assays for this platform and expect a test for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), a leading cause of deafness in infants, to be our next FDA-cleared test on the illumigene platform.\n- 35 -\nImmunoassay and Lead Testing Products\nRevenues from our Diagnostics segment's immunoassay and lead testing products increased 3% in fiscal 2017, following a 1% increase in fiscal 2016. These results reflect the current fiscal year including a full twelve months of Magellan revenue, significantly offset by decreased revenue in our H. pylori and other immunoassay product lines.\nRevenues from Magellan's sale of products to test for elevated levels of lead in blood totaled $18,061. Compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, of which the six months ended March 31, 2016 were prior to Meridian's ownership of Magellan, these revenues increased 2%. This increase was achieved despite the effect on venous blood testing revenue of the previously-noted FDA-related activities.\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our H. pylori products decreased 4% (also 4% in constant-currency) to $30,948, which followed an 8% increase during fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we employed bulk-buy sales programs (also referred to as \u201cstock-and-block\u201d programs) intended to increase major customer inventory levels as a defense against potential competitors upon the expiration of our patent, as further described below. We expect our H. pylori revenue to continue to return to low single-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This growth expectation reflects volume growth from the ongoing conversion of serology testing to our antigen tests. We continue to believe there are ongoing benefits to be realized from our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting (i) the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy; (ii) changes in policies that discourage the use of traditional serology methods and promote the utilization of active infection testing methods; and (iii) physician behavior movement away from serology-based testing and toward direct antigen testing. A significant amount of the H. pylori product revenues are sales to reference labs, whose buying patterns may not be consistent from period to period. During fiscal 2017, we also introduced capabilities to identify resistance to Clarithromycin, the antibiotic commonly used to treat H. pylori. This is currently available in an Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) format. We believe that partnering the ability to diagnose H. pylori and identify resistance provides a strong competitive advantage.\nThe patents for our H. pylori products, owned by us, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our H. pylori products to increase in the near future, as we currently market the only FDA-cleared tests to detect H. pylori antigen in stool samples in the U.S. market. Such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. In order to mitigate competition, our product development pipeline includes multiple new product initiatives for the detection of H. pylori. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any mitigation strategy or that any mitigation strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of the status of certain litigation related to our intellectual property.\n- 36 -\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our other immunoassay products (including C. difficile, foodborne and respiratory) decreased 7% (also 7% in constant-currency) to $58,732, following a 16% decrease in fiscal 2016. A return to growth during the second half of the fiscal year supports our belief that this portion of our business has stabilized and is positioned for future growth (5% increase during the second half of the year, following a 16% decline in the first half of the year).\nLife Science Products\nDuring fiscal 2017, revenues from our Life Science segment increased 12%, with revenues from molecular component sales increasing 8% compared to fiscal 2016 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 15%. Life Science segment revenues increased 5% in fiscal 2016, with revenues from molecular component sales remaining flat compared to fiscal 2015 and revenues from immunoassay component sales increasing 8%. Our molecular components business' growth was negatively impacted by the movement in currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016, with revenues increasing 12% on a constant-currency basis over fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2017, our Life Science segment continued to benefit from (i) increased revenues in the steadily-expanding tropical disease product family, with sales of such products doubling to approximately $2,200 in fiscal 2017; and (ii) increased revenue from sales into China, with such sales totaling approximately $5,900 during fiscal 2017 (approximately $1,000 in the molecular components business and $4,900 in the immunoassay components business) - representing an approximate 44% increase over fiscal 2016. New products, including EPIK\u2122 miRNA Select, JetSeq\u2122, and SensiFast\u2122 Lyo-Ready, also contributed to the increase, with incremental year-over-year revenue growth of approximately $700.\nForeign Currency\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since fiscal 2016 had an approximate $1,200 unfavorable impact on fiscal 2017 revenues; $400 within the Diagnostics segment and $800 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $1,700 unfavorable impact on revenues in fiscal 2016; $700 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,000 within the Life Science segment. Due to natural hedge relationships with expenses, both cost of sales and operating expenses, the overall impact of exchange rate fluctuations on net earnings was not significant during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nSignificant Customers\nRevenue concentrations related to certain customers within our Diagnostics and Life Science segments are set forth in Note 8 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 37 -\nMedical Device Tax\nOn January 1, 2013, the medical device tax established as part of the U.S. health care reform legislation became effective, and as a result, the Company made its first required tax deposit near the end of January 2013. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $0, $500 and $1,900, respectively, of medical device tax expense, which is reflected as a component of cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During December 2015, the Consolidations Appropriations Act of 2016 imposed a two-year moratorium on this excise tax effective January 1, 2016. This moratorium expires December 31, 2017, and we are unable to predict any future legislative changes or developments related to this moratorium or excise tax.\nGross Profit:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 vs.\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs.\nInc (Dec) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-3 points </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+2 points </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The overall gross profit margin decrease during fiscal 2017 primarily results from the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly decreased contribution from our higher margin H. pylori products; (ii) customer mix; (iii) operating segment mix; and (iv) decreased production levels in certain of our production facilities designed to reduce inventory levels. The overall increase in the gross profit margin from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 reflects the combined effects of (i) mix of products sold, particularly the higher revenue contribution from H. pylori products; (ii) realization of manufacturing facility efficiencies for our illumigene products as a result of bringing in-house certain reagent dispensing operations that were previously outsourced; (iii) manufacturing efficiencies in our Life Science segment; (iv) favorable effects of currency rates related to products where the purchase cost is denominated in Euros but the customer sales are billed in U.S. dollars; and (v) decreased medical device tax payments.\nOur overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats, as well as bioresearch reagents, bulk antigens and antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and proficiency panels. Product revenue mix shifts, in the normal course of business, can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points.\n- 38 -\nOperating Expenses:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>

Details of the stock-based compensation activities giving rise to these expenses are set forth in Note 6 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 40 -\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased 27% and 8% in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above, including the Magellan goodwill impairment charge and CEO transition and IP defense costs in fiscal 2017 and the costs associated with acquisition-related activities and sales & marketing leadership reorganization in fiscal 2016.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 includes interest costs on the term loan used to fund the acquisition of Magellan. The effective interest rate on this term loan is 2.76%. In fiscal 2015, other income and expense included $1,100 of foreign currency losses, which related primarily to a foreign subsidiary intercompany loan. This compares to $400 and $600 of foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective rate for income taxes was 41%, 36% and 35% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased fiscal 2017 rate results primarily from the non-deductibility of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the effects of the Magellan goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 35% for fiscal 2017.\nImpact of Inflation\nTo the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin, revenues or operating income in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nLiquidity\nOur cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets, debt service, consideration of acquisition plans and consideration of common share dividends. We have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities.\n- 41 -\nWe have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio, which presently consists of overnight repurchase agreements, bank savings accounts and institutional money market mutual funds. Our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to (i) preserve capital; (ii) provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions; and (iii) capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy's investment eligibility criteria. As we look forward, we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective.\nConsidering the various worldwide geo-political and geo-economic conditions (including Brexit, as more fully discussed within the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Part 1A), we do not expect macroeconomic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs, financial condition or results of operations, although no assurances can be made in this regard. We intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand. If needed, we also have an additional source of liquidity through our $30,000 bank revolving credit facility. Our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and/or liquidity and credit within the financial markets tightens for an extended period of time, and such conditions impact the collectibility of our customer accounts receivable, impact credit terms with our vendors, or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services.\nFluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of June 30th each year, and is performed at the reporting unit level. While these annual reviews to-date have not resulted in the recording of any impairments, a $6,628 impairment charge has been recorded on the goodwill resulting from the Magellan acquisition due to certain FDA activities related to Magellan's lead testing system utilizing venous blood samples (see full description previously within this MD&A). As of September 30, 2017, our stock price was $14.30 per share, compared to our book value per share of $4.02. This relationship, stock price trading at a 3.6x multiple of book value, is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for further impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.\nAs of September 30, 2017, our cash and equivalents balance is $9,846 higher than at the end of fiscal 2016. This increase results in large part from the combined net effects of (i) operating activities providing $4,132 more net cash, as discussed below; (ii) lowering the quarterly cash dividend rate resulting in $9,383 less in shareholder dividends being paid, as discussed below; and (iii) principal payments during the year being $2,250 higher during this first full fiscal year of the term loan obligation.\n- 42 -\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $41,355 during fiscal 2017, an 11% increase from the $37,223 provided during fiscal 2016. While reflecting the effects of the timing of payments from customers, and to suppliers and taxing authorities, this increase also results in large part from the net effects of (i) decreased inventory levels during fiscal 2017, compared to increased levels during fiscal 2016; and (ii) decreased accrued employee compensation costs during fiscal 2017, reflecting the payment of $407 of discretionary bonuses to non-executives related to fiscal 2016 and the timing of regularly scheduled payroll payments. Net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and dividends during the next 12 months.\nFollowing the release of results for the fiscal 2017 first quarter, the board of directors reduced the fiscal 2017 indicated annual cash dividend rate to $0.50 per share (down from $0.80 per share) in order to align it with the stated policy guidelines of the payout ratio to range between 75% and 85% of each fiscal year's net earnings. This indicated annual rate represents 75% of fiscal 2017's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nCapital Resources\nIn connection with the acquisition of Magellan, the Company entered into a $60,000 five-year term loan and related interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank, the details of which are set forth in Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have a $30,000 revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that expires March 31, 2021. As of November 29, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility"}
