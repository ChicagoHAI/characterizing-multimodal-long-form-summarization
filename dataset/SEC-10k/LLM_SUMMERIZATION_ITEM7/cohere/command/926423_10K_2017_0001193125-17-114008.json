Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe operate in two segments, Equipment Manufacturing and Sales and Equipment Leasing. Equipment Manufacturing and Sales includes sales of Seamap equipment, sales of Klein equipment and sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP. This segment operates from locations near Bristol, United Kingdom, Brisbane, Australia, Salem, New Hampshire and in Singapore.\nOur equipment leasing operations include all leasing activity, sales of lease pool equipment and certain other equipment sales and services related to those operations. This business is conducted from our Huntsville, Texas headquarters and from our locations in Calgary, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Singapore and Ufa, Russia. This includes the operations of our subsidiaries MCL, MEL, MML and MSE, our branch in Colombia and the leasing operations conducted by SAP.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015 and, accordingly, our consolidated results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2016 include only one month of operations from Klein, which amounts were not material.\nIndex to Financial Statements Prior to the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP were included in our leasing segment. Segment operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the revised segment structure.\nManagement believes that the performance of our Equipment Leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment. Management further believes that the performance of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales. Management monitors EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both as defined in the following table, as key indicators of our overall performance and liquidity.\nThe following table presents certain operating information by operating segment:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

interest income and interest expense, (b) provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash costs of lease pool equipment sales, certain non-recurring contract settlement costs, impairment of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. This definition of Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definition in the Credit Agreement. We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important indicators for the performance of our business, but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity, and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures, service debt and finance working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement contained financial covenants based on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us. In particular, we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex to Financial Statements\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.

Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are only two of the measurements that management utilizes. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Non-recurring contract settlement costs of approximately $2.1 million include approximately $1.8 million of deferred cash payments and approximately $300,000 of stock based compensation. </td> </tr>\n</table> Within our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, we design, manufacture and sell a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense applications. Seamap's primary products include the (i) GunLink and Digishot seismic source acquisition and control systems, which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools; and (ii) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers (marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel). Klein designs, manufactures and sells side scan sonar and water-side security systems to commercial, governmental and military customers throughout the world. SAP sells equipment, consumable supplies, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia.\nIn our Equipment Leasing segment, we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land, transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide. We provide short-term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer's requirements. All active leases at January 31, 2017 were for a term of less than one year. Seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment. These amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, less accumulated depreciation. From time to time, we sell lease pool equipment to our customers. These sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business. Additionally, when equipment that has been leased to a customer is lost or destroyed, the customer is charged for such equipment at amounts specified in the underlying lease agreement. These charges are included in \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d in the accompanying financial statements. We occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers and provide repair and support services to our rental customers.\nSeismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions. In Canada and Russia, a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months, from December through March or April. During the months in which the weather is warmer, certain areas are not accessible to trucks, earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain. Accordingly, our first and fourth quarters have historically produced higher leasing revenues than the second and third quarters. However, in recent periods the effect of this historical seasonality has been less pronounced due to the general decline in seismic exploration activity in Canada and Russia. In other areas of the world, periods of heavy rain can impair seismic operations. These periods of inclement weather can impact our results of operations; however, there is no historical trend as to the timing of such impact. We are able, in many cases, to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization. Our results of operations, particularly those of our Equipment Leasing segment, can also experience fluctuations in activity levels due to matters unrelated to seasonal or weather factors. These factors include the periodic shift of seismic exploration activity from one geographic region to another and difficulties encountered by our customers due to permitting and other logistical challenges. See Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIndex to Financial Statements Business Outlook\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we experienced a dramatic decline in our Equipment Leasing segment and in that portion of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment related to oil and gas exploration activities. The revenues of our Equipment Leasing segment and to a lesser degree our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment are related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors, which, in turn, are affected by expectations regarding supply and demand for oil and natural gas, energy prices and finding and development costs. The significant decline in global oil prices that occurred during fiscal 2016, we believe, resulted in a corresponding decline in oil and gas exploration activities, particularly seismic exploration programs. Although oil prices have recovered somewhat from their historical lows, prices remain well below historical highs and much uncertainty remains regarding future pricing. The seismic industry in general, and our business in particular, have been negatively affected by the decline in activity noted above.\nAccordingly, we believe a number of factors have negatively affected, and will continue to affect, our business, particularly our Equipment Leasing segment. These factors include reduced demand for seismic services and related equipment, an excess of supply of seismic exploration equipment, increased competition among suppliers of seismic exploration equipment and a reduction in pricing for the sale or rental of both new and used seismic exploration equipment. In recent months we have experienced increased activity in our seismic business in the form of inquiries, bids and proposals. Based on this, we believe this market is improving. However, we believe the improvement will be gradual with only marginal improvement in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 and that it is unlikely that our the financial results of our Equipment Leasing Segment return to levels seen in fiscal 2015 in the foreseeable future.\nWe have implemented a strategy in order to address the changes in circumstances discussed above. This strategy includes the following:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increased emphasis on our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment. We intend to expand our product offerings with an emphasis on products and services that are not exclusively dependent upon oil and gas exploration activity. We expect new products and services to come from a combination of internally developed products and those acquired from third parties, such as the acquisition of Klein in December 2015. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Redeploy capital from lease pool. We expect our Equipment Leasing Segment to remain an important component of our business. However, we believe there are opportunities to selectively sell certain lease pool assets and redeploy that capital in order to reduce debt, acquire other lease pool assets or invest in other opportunities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Selectively invest in new lease pool assets. Due to the increased competition and challenging economic conditions in the seismic equipment industry, we intend to limit future acquisitions of lease pool assets to situations that enhance the value of our existing assets or in which we enjoy a competitive advantage due to pricing, operational considerations or exclusivity arrangements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Utilize our broad geographical footprint. We believe our nine world-wide locations and exposure to a number of different geographical markets provides an advantage over many competitors. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Maintain a capital structure with limited leverage. Historically, we have utilized short-term commercial banking facilities to temporarily finance capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Due to conditions within the oil and gas industry, including our own recent financial results, and associated regulatory pressures, access to such capital has become more limited and may not be available to us in amounts historically available. Accordingly, we intend to reduce our exposure to short-term credit facilities and rely on other sources of expansion capital, and in March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Seamap Credit Facility (as defined below) and cancelled that facility. Such sources could include cash flow provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of lease pool assets, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of equity securities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex to Financial Statements The market for products sold by Seamap is primarily dependent upon activity within the offshore, or marine, seismic industry, including the re-fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels. However, these products are also utilized by hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels whose activities are not limited to oil and gas related operations. Our Seamap business has benefited from equipping new-build vessels and from re-equipping older vessels with newer, more efficient technology. In addition, as Seamap has expanded its installed base of products, including the product lines purchased in fiscal 2015, our business for replacements, spare parts, repair and support services has expanded. The overall decline in seismic exploration activity has had, and can be expected to continue to have, an impact on the demand for Seamap's products and services. However, we believe the expansion of our product offerings and the desire for customers to upgrade to newer, more efficient technology will mitigate this impact to some extent. We also believe that Seamap has been successful in penetrating new markets recently, partially due to the product lines purchased from ION in fiscal 2015, as evidenced by deliveries to new customers in China during fiscal 2016 and 2017. We continue to have discussions with existing and potential customers regarding new products and enhancement to existing products in order to better meet the needs of the marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic industries.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a manufacturing arrangement with Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (\u201cPGS\u201d), one of the largest marine seismic contractors in the world. Under this arrangement, we manufacture and sell to PGS a customized and proprietary marine energy source controller that is based on our GunLink 4000 product (the \u201cPGS SourceLink\u201d). We have previously collaborated with PGS to develop PGS SourceLink. We expect PGS SourceLink will be deployed on the majority of PGS' fleet of seismic vessels; however, current industry conditions will likely result in a delay in the complete deployment of the new products. The deployment of new products is expected take place over a period of several years.\nWe expect to make additional deliveries to PGS in fiscal 2018 related to the re-equipping of existing vessels. We are also pursuing a number of opportunities in Asia for the equipping of hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels. Some of these opportunities include products from both Seamap and Klein.\nDemand for Klein's products is generally not dependent upon activity within the oil and gas industry. Customers for these products primarily consist of domestic and foreign governmental and military organizations and commercial entities involved in the hydrographic and oceanographic industries. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations as more fully discussed below. However, we believe we are well positioned with recently introduced products and product enhancements and therefore expect revenues from these products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe decline in oil and gas exploration activity in recent years has resulted in a significant decline in the demand for seismic exploration equipment and our equipment rental services. This has also resulted in a material decline in prices for such equipment and services, as much as 50% or more in some cases. While there are indications of improving conditions, we expect such improvement to be marginal and for conditions in the seismic industry to remain challenging through fiscal 2018.\nDemand for the rental of land seismic exploration equipment varies by geographic region. We expect continuing demand in Europe and the Pacific Rim and improving demand in South America during fiscal 2018. We have experienced some increased demand in North America, but such demand has been sporadic and there is much competition in that geographic region. Activity in Russia has been, and is expected to remain, restrained due to economic issues and trade restrictions in that region. We do anticipate opportunities for projects in other parts of the world, including North Africa and The Middle East, some of which could be significant. However, competition for such projects is generally intense and there is no assurance that we will have the opportunity to provide equipment for such projects.\nMarine leasing activity has declined significantly over the past three years. We believe this is due in large part to an excess of equipment in the marine seismic market. As marine contractors have sought to reduce costs by retiring older vessels an excess of used equipment has become available, thereby reducing the demand for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nrental equipment. While we have experienced an increase in inquiries for marine equipment in recent months, we believe this excess of available equipment will continue into fiscal 2018.\nThe demand for downhole seismic equipment was very weak in fiscal 2017. In recent months we have experienced an increase in inquiries for this equipment and have recently commenced certain projects. However, we expect demand for this equipment to remain subdued, increasing marginally during fiscal 2018. This equipment is most often used in applications related to the development of oil and gas properties, such as frac monitoring or reservoir monitoring programs. Accordingly, the degree to which current oil prices and exploration activity influence demand for these products can be different from that for our other equipment.\nThe oil and gas industry, in general, and the seismic industry, in particular, have historically been cyclical businesses. If worldwide oil and gas prices should remain at current depressed levels or decline from current levels, we could see a material change in the level of our business and our income from operations.\nIn response to the decline in demand for our equipment and what we believe to be an excess of equipment in the market, we have significantly reduced our purchases of lease pool equipment from historical levels. During fiscal 2017, we added approximately $441,000 to our lease pool, as compared to approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $11.8 million in fiscal 2015. We expect lease pool additions in fiscal 2018 to be at a level similar to that in fiscal 2017. We expect any such additions will be limited to maintenance of our existing equipment or additional ancillary items that will enhance our ability to lease existing equipment. However, should industry conditions change, or unusual opportunities present themselves, we could revise our planned leased pool additions.\nWe continually monitor the composition of our lease pool in relation to general industry conditions and customer requirements. As a result of this, from time to time we may seek to reduce the amount of certain types of equipment in our lease pool or to completely divest ourselves of certain types of equipment. Sales of lease pool equipment are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d. We also analyze the demand for the types and amount of equipment within various geographic regions and will move equipment among our various locations as warranted.\nHistorically, there have been two or three primary manufacturers of land seismic equipment. Recently, the industry has seen the emergence of additional entities seeking to introduce new equipment, particularly wireless recording equipment. Accordingly, significant competition among these new and existing manufacturers has developed. This competition has, we believe, led to pricing pressure for the manufacturers of equipment. While we benefit from lower prices for new equipment, this situation has had a negative impact on the pricing for our leasing products and services.\nWe believe one of our key competitive advantages is our broad geographic footprint and ability to operate in a number of areas. We have accomplished this over the past several years by establishing subsidiaries and branch operations such that we now operate in nine countries. In response to a decline in activity in some regions, we have taken steps to reduce costs such as by reducing personnel. As a result of reduced activity in Latin America, we decided to close our branch operation in Peru in fiscal 2017. We believe that all opportunities within that region can be more efficiently managed from our branch in Colombia. The impact of this closing has not been material to our results of operations. We will continue to monitor our costs in relation to our activity, but at this time we have no plans to eliminate any of our other operating locations. Should industry conditions improve, or should particular opportunities arise, we may seek to expand our operating locations either by establishing \u201cgreen field\u201d operations or by acquiring other businesses.\nCertain of our customers have experienced delays in payments from their customers or other financial distress. As a result, they have delayed payments to us beyond the originally agreed to terms. We have negotiated extended payment terms or other settlement agreements with some of these customers. In some cases, we have restructured amounts due into secured notes. We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwe estimate to be uncollectable. However, further delays in customer payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues from international customers totaled approximately $34.7 million, $44.5 million and $70.5 million, respectively. These amounts represent 85%, 86% and 85% of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years, respectively. The majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in United States, Australian, Canadian and Singapore dollars and Russian rubles. We have not entered, nor do we intend to enter, into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes.\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years, except as described above.\nResults of Operations\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded operating losses of approximately $31.3 million, $26.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from lower equipment leasing activity. The decrease in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 relates to significantly lower leasing revenue, lower equipment sales, contract settlement costs and impairment of intangible assets. These factors were partially offset by lower lease pool depreciation and general and administrative expenses.\nRevenues and Cost of Sales\nEquipment Manufacturing and Sales\nRevenues and cost of sales for our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment were as follows:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seamap\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Klein\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intra-segment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,978 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seamap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Klein\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intra-segment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,869 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Demand for Seamap's products is dependent to a large degree upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity; however, a portion of such demand relates to activity within the hydrographic and geotechnical survey industry. A large portion of Seamap's sales consist of large discrete orders, the timing of which is dictated by our customers. This timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed. Accordingly, there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another which does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products. Although recently there has been a\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsoftening of demand within the marine seismic industry in general, we believe that we have continued to experience demand for Seamap's products because operators of marine seismic vessels have been adding newly built vessels to replace older, less efficient vessels and have been upgrading technology on remaining vessels in order to improve operating efficiency. Furthermore, some hydrographic survey operators have continued to increase their capacity and upgrade technology. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, Seamap did experience a decline in demand for its products and a delay in certain projects as marine contractors revised spending plans in response to the decline in oil prices. Many contractors have retired or cold stacked vessels and therefore an excess of equipment has developed. Accordingly, the demand for spare parts and repairs has declined over the past two years. However, based on our backlog of orders as of January 31, 2017 and inquiries from customers, we expect revenue from the sale of Seamap products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The gross profit generated by sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $8.0 million, $10.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. The gross profit margin from the sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 57%, 49% and 51%, respectively. The fluctuations in gross profit margin among the periods were due primarily to changes in product mix.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015, accordingly the operating results related to these operations are not material to fiscal 2016 and the comparison between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is not meaningful. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations. Delays in the completion of engineering and manufacturing activities related to revisions and enhancements to certain products resulted in delays in the availability of these products. Accordingly, expected shipments of these products were delayed. We believe that the aforementioned engineering and manufacturing activities have been essentially completed and that shipment of these products will return to anticipated levels. Therefore, we expect revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2018 to exceed that in fiscal 2017. The gross profit from sale of Klein products was approximately $2.5 million, a gross profit margin of 30%. This margin is less than that normally anticipated due to the effect of certain fixed manufacturing costs and unexpected costs to complete certain projects in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.\nSAP is a distributor and reseller of new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in Australia and throughout the Pacific Rim, including equipment manufactured by Klein and occasionally Seamap. Demand from customers in the Philippines and China, who are most often governmental organizations, has generally been strong over the past three years; however, revenues from year to year can vary significantly due to the timing of discrete orders. The gross profit from the sale of new seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by SAP amounted to approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2017, $650,000 in fiscal 2016, and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015, representing gross profit margins of 23%, 26% and 22%, respectively. The changes in gross profit margins between the years reflect changes in product mix from year to year. The effect of sales from Klein to SAP is eliminated in consolidation and in the table above as \u201cintra-segment sales\u201d.\nAs of January 31, 2017 the backlog of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment was approximately $12.5 million, as compared to approximately $8.7 million as of January 31, 2016. We expect essentially all of these orders to be completed in fiscal 2018. Based on our experience and the lead times for the production of our product, we do not believe backlog as of a particular date is necessarily indicative of future results.\nIndex to Financial Statements Equipment Leasing\nRevenues and cost of sales from our Equipment Leasing segment were comprised of the following:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,299 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease pool equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease pool depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct costs - equipment leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,689 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of lease pool equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of other equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross (loss) profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,902 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,238 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross (loss) profit margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(119 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Equipment leasing revenues decreased approximately 57% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and 51% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. This downward trend reflects the dramatic decline in oil and gas exploration activity in essentially all geographic regions brought about the decline and uncertainty in world-wide oil prices. Leasing activity in fiscal 2017 declined in all areas except for Canada and Latin America. Fiscal 2017 activity was substantially below that in fiscal 2015 for all areas. The decline in demand for equipment leasing and a decline in the pricing for new seismic exploration equipment have resulted in a reduction in pricing for equipment leasing services. The magnitude of the changes in prices varies significantly from region to region, by the type of equipment and according to the other terms of a particular transaction. However, price reductions in fiscal 2017 of up to 50% as compared to fiscal 2015 and prior pricing have been encountered.\nThe geographic regions with the largest contributions to our land leasing revenues in fiscal 2017 were Latin America, Europe, the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2016 the regions making the largest contributions to leasing revenues were the United States, Europe, Russia and the Pacific Rim.\nRevenues from our downhole lease business were minimal in fiscal 2017 and declined in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting the downturn in the industry and reduced exploration and development expenditures by oil and gas companies.\nRevenues from our marine leasing declined significantly in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and were relatively consistent in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We believe this decline is due in part to consolidation within the marine seismic industry and the retirement or temporary moth-balling of a number of seismic vessels. This has, in our opinion, resulted in an excess of equipment available in the market. We believe this excess of equipment to be temporary but will likely continue into fiscal 2018.\nIn recent weeks we have received an increase in bids and inquiries from customers for the rental of equipment. We believe this could be indicative of a recovery in the seismic exploration market. However, there is no assurance that these bids and inquiries will result in rental contracts and a corresponding increase in our leasing revenues. We believe there remains an excess of equipment available in the seismic industry which will continue to exert negative pressure on demand and pricing for the rental of such equipment.\nIndex to Financial Statements From time to time, we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy capital in other lease pool assets or other business opportunities. These transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and, accordingly, are difficult to predict. Also included in sales of lease pool equipment are charges to leasing customers for lost or destroyed equipment. Due to the recent changes in the seismic equipment market we have implemented a strategy to dispose of certain lease pool equipment. Accordingly, revenue from the sales of lease pool equipment increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. We expect to make additional sales in fiscal 2018. The sale of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2017 resulted in a gross loss of approximately $300,000. The gross profit from the lease pool equipment sales amounted to approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $2.1 million in fiscal 2015. The amount of the gross profit or loss on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment. Based on current negotiations and market conditions, we expect that the sales of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2018 will result in a gross profit.\nOccasionally, we sell other seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers. In addition, we occasionally sell equipment that we produce for use in deploying and retrieving seismic equipment by helicopter and sell certain ancillary marine equipment. The sale of marine equipment may include associated installation services. The sale of other seismic equipment resulted in a gross profit of approximately $271,000 in fiscal 2017, a gross loss of approximately $91,000 in fiscal 2016 and a gross profit of approximately $585,000 in fiscal 2015.\nLease pool depreciation expense for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $25.8 million, as compared to approximately $29.5 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $34.4 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases reflect reduced purchases of lease pool equipment in recent periods. We reduced our lease pool additions in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 in response to industry conditions. We anticipate maintaining a low level of lease pool additions in fiscal 2018. Therefore, as existing assets become fully depreciated and as we sell certain lease pool assets, we expect that lease pool depreciation expense will continue to decline. Depreciation of lease pool equipment commences upon its initial deployment on a lease contract and continues uninterrupted from that point, regardless of whether the equipment is subsequently on a lease contract. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The useful lives of our assets range from two to 10 years. At January 31, 2017, lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately $93.0 million were fully depreciated, yet remained in service. This compares to $72.8 million at January 31, 2016. These assets, though fully depreciated, are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity.\nWe recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal 2017 in the amount of approximately $3.3 million as compared to approximately $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2015. These costs as a percentage of leasing revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 are 32%, 20% and 14%, respectively. Direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues, as the three main components of direct costs are freight, repairs and sublease expense. However, a portion of these costs are fixed, such as warehouse and employee related expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $20.7 million, compared to approximately $19.0 million and $25.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2017 amounts reflect a full-year of activity related to Klein, which we acquired effective December 31, 2015. Without this effect, general and administrative expenses would have declined approximately 6% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The reductions in fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect various cost reduction activities implemented during that year in response to the general downturn in the Company's business. These initiatives include reduced headcount, reduced working hours in some locations, voluntary salary reductions for certain officers and senior managers, lower incentive compensation and lower travel costs.\nDue to the decline in seismic exploration activity, we think it now more likely that certain of our customers will encounter financial difficulties and may be unable to fully satisfy their financial obligations to us. Therefore, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we provided approximately $750,000, $2.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfor doubtful accounts. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, we had trade accounts and note receivables over 90 days past due of approximately $11.7 million and $16.0 million, respectively. In our industry, and in our experience, it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately $5.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively.\nIn September 2015, upon the death of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Billy F. Mitcham, Jr., certain obligations accrued pursuant to his employment contract. The effects of these obligations total approximately $2.1 million and consist of deferred cash payments to his estate of approximately $1.8 million and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation of approximately $300,000.\nDepreciation and amortization, other than lease pool depreciation, relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture, fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2017 and 2016 relates to intangible assets acquired in December 2016 related to Klein and May 2014 in connection with the ION product lines.\nWe periodically evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets, including goodwill. For fiscal 2017, our evaluation did not give an indication of impairment. In fiscal 2016, our evaluation did give an indication of impairment. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2016. Approximately $600,000 of this charge relates to intangible assets related to helipicker assets acquired in fiscal 2011 and approximately $3.0 million relates to goodwill associated with Seamap.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements. Interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal years primarily due to lower average borrowings during those periods.\nOther income and expense relates primarily to net foreign exchange losses and gains. These gains and losses resulted primarily from two situations. Certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the U.S. dollar yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in other currencies. These operations generally have net assets denominated in these other currencies. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against these other currencies, a foreign exchange loss arises and vice versa. In fiscal 2017 we recorded foreign exchange losses of approximately $72,000 related to these situations. In fiscal 2016 we recorded foreign exchange gains of approximately $1.3 million related to these situations. In fiscal 2015, we incurred approximately $1.3 million of exchange losses of this nature primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Colombian Peso. In the second situation, certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the local currency yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in the U.S. dollar. These operations generally have net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, including inter-company obligations. In fiscal 2017, we incurred approximately $339,000 of exchange gains of this type. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of exchange losses of this type, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Russian ruble, Australian dollar, British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. We believe gains and losses of this type are non-cash items and are considered in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 is approximately $1.8 million. This amount differs from that expected when applying the U.S. statutory rate to our loss before income taxes due primarily to recording a valuation allowance against all of the fiscal 2017 increase in our deferred tax assets and the effect of foreign withholding taxes.\nIndex to Financial Statements In fiscal 2016, due to changing economic conditions, we evaluated the recoverability of various deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in various jurisdictions, including the United States. As a result of this evaluation we established a valuation allowance for essentially all deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $15.5 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 we determined to deduct certain prior year foreign tax credits in our U.S. income tax returns, rather than take such amounts as a credit against future taxes. This change in treatment resulted in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $2.6 million. These items are the primary factors causing our total income tax expense in fiscal 2016, which amounted to approximately $11.0 million, to differ from the expected income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34%.\nIn fiscal 2015, our provision for income taxes was a benefit of approximately $1.0 million, which is an effective tax rate of approximately 10%. This is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 34% due primarily to a valuation allowance provided against certain deferred tax assets, the effect of lower average tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign withholding taxes. In fiscal 2015, we evaluated the likelihood of recovery for our deferred tax assets in light of all available positive and negative evidence. As a result of that evaluation, we established a valuation allowance amounting to approximately $1.4 million related to those deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. The principal factor that has affected our cash flow from operating activities is the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above.\nWe believe that our liquidity needs for the next 12 months will be met from cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of lease pool equipment and from proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, taking into account the possible restrictions on funds from our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Seamap Credit Facility and cancelled that facility. We are engaged in discussions with other commercial banks regarding establishing a new revolving credit facility or facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in negotiating any such facilities. Accordingly, we currently do not plan to rely upon proceeds from revolving credit facilities to meet our liquidity and capital needs.\nIn June 2016, we completed an offering of 9.00% cumulative preferred stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The Series A Preferred Stock (i) allows for redemption on at our option (even in the event of a change of control), (ii) does not grant holders with voting control of our Board of Directors, and (iii) provides holders with a conversion option (into common stock) only upon a change of control which upon conversion would be subject to a limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock to be issued.\nShould our needs for liquidity increase, such as to make an acquisition, acquire lease pool assets, or make other investments, we may seek to issue other debt or equity securities.\nIndex to Financial Statements The following table sets forth selected historical information regarding cash flows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,269 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,242 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,313 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,638 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,434 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(511 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(546 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(258 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,406 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,987 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> As of January 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $21.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.5 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $28.2 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.8 million at January 31, 2016. Our working capital decreased from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2017 primarily due the decline in accounts receivable attributable to decreased revenue for fiscal 2017 and maturity and repayments of long-term debt. These items were partially offset by working capital generated by operations.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to approximately $3.2 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to approximately $15.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $25.2 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2017, the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities was our net loss of $33.2 million net of non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization charges totaling approximately $28.3 million. The net change in other current assets and liabilities increased net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 by approximately $5.2 million.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we acquired approximately $441,000, $2.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, of new lease pool equipment; however, the cash expenditures for these purchases did not all occur within those respective periods. As of January 31, 2017, our accounts payable included approximately $130,000 related to lease pool purchases. As of January 31, 2016, the amount in accounts payable related to lease pool purchases was approximately $325,000, while the comparable amount as of January 31, 2015 was approximately $72,000. Accordingly, our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal 2017 and 2016 indicated purchases of equipment held for lease of approximately $636,000 and $2.2 million, respectively. We currently estimate that lease pool purchases during fiscal 2018 will be comparable to fiscal 2017.\nIn fiscal 2016 we acquired Klein for $10.0 million in cash. During fiscal 2015, we purchased certain product lines from ION for cash of approximately $14.5 million. Both of these acquisitions were financed with cash on hand and proceeds from our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the completion of the ION transaction, Seamap entered into a $10.0 million term loan facility. We used the proceeds from that facility to repay amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement, as discussed below. Cash flows from investing activities for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflect proceeds of approximately $5.3 million, $2.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, from the sale of used lease pool equipment.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we made net repayments of borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $10.9 million, $2.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The repayments in fiscal 2016 were net of borrowings of approximately $10.0 million related to the acquisition of Klein in December 2015. As discussed above, in fiscal 2015 Seamap entered into a term loan facility to partially finance the acquisition of product lines from ION. Proceeds from this facility were $10.0 million. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 we made scheduled repayments totaling approximately $3.2 million, $3.2 million and\nIndex to Financial Statements\n$800,000, respectively, under the Seamap Credit Facility. In fiscal 2017, we paid cash dividend of approximately $486,000 related to the Series A Preferred Stock. In fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.0 million shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 852,100 shares at a cost of approximately $9.8 million, which completed the authorized purchases.\nIn connection with the temporary importation of our lease pool equipment into some countries we are required to post import bonds with the customs authorities of that country. In addition, from time to time we must post bonds in connection with bid, delivery or warranty obligations. These bonds are normally provided by local insurance, surety companies or local banks. In some cases, the party issuing the bond requires that we post collateral to secure our obligations under the bonds. As of January 31, 2017, no letters of credit under the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility were outstanding.\nOn August 2, 2013, we entered into a syndicated $50 million, secured, three-year revolving credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (\u201cHSBC\u201d) as administrative agent. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement could be used for working capital and general corporate needs. Up to $10.0 million of the Credit Agreement could be used to secure letters of credit. Through a series of amendments and unilateral reductions the total commitment under the facility was reduced to $10.0 million as of January 31, 2017. In March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations and terminated that agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provided for Eurodollar loans, which bore interest at the Eurodollar base rate, plus a margin of from 2.50% to 3.50% based on our leverage ratio and for ABR loans which bore interest at the applicable base rate plus a margin of from 1.50% to 2.50% based on our leverage ratio. As of January 31, 2017, the margins for Eurodollar loans and ABR loans were 3.50% and 2.50%, respectively. We agreed to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Agreement of from 0.375% to 0.50% based on our leverage ratio. As of January 31, 2017, the commitment fee rate was 0.50%.\nAmounts available under the Credit Agreement were subject to a borrowing base which was determined based primarily on the appraised value of our domestic lease pool equipment and certain accounts receivable. The Credit Agreement was secured by essentially all of our domestic assets and 65% of the capital stock of Mitcham Holdings Ltd., which is the holding company for all of our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contained customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, additional indebtedness, other than indebtedness to HSBC, in excess of $5.0 million, acquisitions, fundamental changes, dispositions of property, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates and lines of business. The events of default included a change in control provision.\nThe Credit Agreement contained certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA, a minimum ratio of fixed charges to adjusted EBITDA and, in certain circumstances, a maximum ratio of capital expenditures to adjusted EBITDA, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nIn August 2014, Seamap Singapore entered into a $15.0 million credit facility with HSBC - Singapore (the \u201cSeamap Credit Facility\u201d). The facility consists of a $10.0 million term loan, a $3.0 million uncommitted revolving credit facility, and a $2.0 million uncommitted banker's guarantee facility. The term facility provides for eleven quarterly principal payments of $800,000 and a final payment of $1,200,000 on or before August 22, 2017. Interest on the term facility was payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 2.75%. The agreement contained customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants included restrictions on Seamap Singapore related to liens, additional indebtedness, acquisitions, fundamental changes, dispositions of property, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates and lines of business. The agreement contained financial covenants that required Seamap Singapore to maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum ratio of EBITDA to debt, both as defined in the agreement.\nIndex to Financial Statements On April 5, 2017, we prepaid all amounts outstanding under the Seamap Credit Facility and cancelled that facility.\nOur average borrowing levels under the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $12.2 million, $17.6 million and $26.3 million, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of January 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of other companies, businesses or product lines. If we were to make any such acquisitions, we believe they could generally be financed with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations. However, should these sources of financing not be adequate, we may seek other sources of capital in order to fund acquisitions. These additional sources of capital include additional bank credit facilities or the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, other than our branch operations in Colombia, through January 31, 2017, to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. The undistributed earnings have been reinvested through the purchase of lease pool equipment and other assets, strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of product lines from ION, and additional working capital to support ongoing operations and expansion of the businesses. As of January 31, 2017, we estimate that these undistributed earnings amount to approximately $53.7 million and that the distribution of these earnings would result in no additional taxes.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had deposits in foreign banks equal to approximately $3.3 million. All $3.3 million of these deposits could be distributed to the United States to repay inter-company indebtedness without any adverse tax consequences.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence; the useful lives of our lease pool assets and amortizable intangible assets and the impairment assessments of our lease pool and various intangible assets. Other areas where we have made significant estimates include the valuation of stock options, the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets and the assessment of uncertain tax positions.\nIndex to Financial Statements Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial position and results of operations and require management's subjective judgment. Below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Leases - We recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease unless there is a question as to whether it is collectible. We do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations. Under our standard lease, the customer is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment, excluding normal wear and tear. We provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices. In most situations, our customers pay shipping and handling costs directly to the shipping agents. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Equipment Sales - We recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred, unless there is a question as to its collectability. We occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions. These terms are generally one to two years in duration. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-term project revenue - From time to time, SAP and Klein enter into contracts whereby they assemble and/or manufacture and sell certain marine equipment, primarily to governmental entities. Performance under these contracts generally occurs over a period of three to twelve months. Revenue and costs related to these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Service agreements - Seamap provides on-going support services pursuant to contracts that generally have a term of 12 months. We recognize revenue from these contracts over the term of the contract. In some cases, we will provide support services on a time and material basis. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the services are provided. For certain new systems that Seamap sells, we provide support services for up to 12 months at no additional charge. Any amounts attributable to these support obligations are immaterial. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a detailed review of outstanding receivable balances. Factors considered include the age of the receivable, the payment history of the customer, the general financial condition of the customer, any financial or operational leverage we may have in a particular situation and general industry conditions. We typically do not charge fees on past due accounts, although we reserve the right to do so in most of our contractual arrangements with our customers and have done so from time to time. As of January 31, 2017, the average age of our accounts receivable was approximately 92 days. Based on our view of general industry conditions and the specific customer factors discussed above, in fiscal 2017 we provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $750,000.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe carry our lease pool of equipment and other property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and compute depreciation on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment, which range from two to 10 years. Geophones and batteries are depreciated over three years and recording channels over five to seven years. Buildings are depreciated over 30 years, property improvements are amortized over 10 years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life and the life of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized from three to 15 years.\nThe estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on our experience as to the economic useful life of our products. We review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment, including technological obsolescence, market demand and actual historical useful service life of our\nIndex to Financial Statements\nlease pool equipment. Additionally, to the extent information is available publicly, we compare our depreciation policies to those of other companies in our industry for reasonableness. When we purchase new equipment for our lease pool, we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated, whether or not the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period.\nOur policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following: if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue, then the asset will remain on our books. However, if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity, then it is removed from our books.\nWe carry our amortizable intangible assets at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed on a straight-line method (for customer relationships, the straight-line method is not materially different from other methods that estimate run off of the underlying customer base) over the estimated life of the asset. Currently, patents are amortized over 8 to 9-year period, proprietary rights are amortized over a 10 to 15-year period, customer relationships are amortized over an 8-year period, and covenants-not-to-compete are amortized over a three-year period. The basis for the proprietary rights and customer relationships lives are generally based upon the results of valuation reports commissioned from third parties. Patents are amortized over their remaining term. Covenants-not-to-compete are amortized over the term of the contract.\nWe annually assess our lease pool equipment for potential impairment. The assessment determines if, in our opinion, events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances might include the following:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A significant decrease in the market price of the asset; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the assets are being used or in their physical condition; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A current period operating or cash flow loss, a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses associated with the use of the assets; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>A current expectation that it is more likely than not that the assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf there is an indication of possible impairment, we test the assets for recoverability. Recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our lease pool assets to their total carrying value. Considering the general industry downturn and the factors noted above, we performed a test for recoverability as of January 31, 2017. We determined that despite recent declines in the overall business environment, there was no impairment of our lease pool assets. See Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nCertain identifiable intangible assets, including certain patent rights, trade names and customer relationships, relate to our leasing business, primarily in Canada. In fiscal 2016, due to the downturn in our leasing business in Canada, we determined that the remaining carrying value of those intangible assets exceeded their fair value and we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $600,000 which represented the remaining carrying value of those assets.\nRemaining intangible assets, including goodwill, relate to our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, which includes the operations of Seamap and Klein. For purposes of evaluating impairment pursuant to FASB\nIndex to Financial Statements\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 350, we established Seamap and Klein as reporting units. In accordance with ASC 350 we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not impairment has occurred. We formally evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually, as of January 31 for each of our reporting units. We first perform a qualitative assessment by evaluating relevant events or circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If we are unable to conclude qualitatively that is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, then we use a two-step quantitative assessment of fair value of a reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill is determined to be more than the fair value of the reporting unit, there exists a possibility of impairment of goodwill. Any impairment related to goodwill is measured in two steps by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to net assets and liabilities to determine the implied carrying value of goodwill. The implied carrying value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of the goodwill. Any excess of carrying value over implied carrying value is recorded as an impairment loss.\nIn fiscal 2016, we concluded, based on qualitative factors, that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the Seamap reporting unit was more than its fair value. We therefore conducted a quantitative assessment as discussed above. Based on this quantitative assessment, we recorded an impairment loss of $3.0 million related to the Seamap reporting unit.\nAs of January 31, 2017 we concluded, based on qualitative and quantitative factors, that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the Seamap reporting unit was not more than its fair value.\nAs of January 31, 2017 we concluded, based on qualitative and quantitative factors, that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the Klein reporting unit was not more than its fair value.\nOur quantitative assessment requires significant judgment and is based upon our internal forecasts and comparisons to the publicly available valuations of what we believe to be comparable companies. Our internal forecasts include assumptions about market and economic conditions. If our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future, or if we use different comparable companies, we may be required to record further impairment charges. If the operational results of our reporting units are worse than expected or if economic conditions deteriorate, the fair value of our reporting units will be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting. We assessed, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets associated with tax loss carryovers and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered from future taxable income. The analysis is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nThe weight we give to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (i) the more positive evidence is necessary and (ii) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>taxable income projections in future years; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our history of taxable income within a particular jurisdiction;

Although we do not have a history of such loss carryovers expiring without being utilized and the earliest expiration of a loss carryforward is in 2033, we have a recent history of taxable losses in the United States and future earnings in this\nIndex to Financial Statements\njurisdiction are uncertain. In order to fully utilize the deferred tax assets in the United States we would need to generate taxable income of approximately $55.0 million.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken through a two-step process. In the first step, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. In the second step, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in (1) an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a reduction of an income tax refund receivable or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2). The evaluation of tax positions and the measurement of the related benefit require significant judgment on the part of management.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded based on the grant date fair value of share-based awards. Determining the grant date fair value requires management to make estimates regarding the variables used in the calculation of the grant date fair value. Those variables are the future volatility of our common stock price, the length of time an optionee will hold their options until exercising them (the \u201cexpected term\u201d), and the number of options or shares that will be forfeited before they are exercised (the \u201cforfeiture rate\u201d). We utilize various mathematical models in calculating the variables. Stock-based compensation expense could be different if we used different models to calculate the variables.\nSignificant Accounting and Disclosure Changes\nSee Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements,

affecting the comparability of the above information.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe operate in two segments, Equipment Manufacturing and Sales and Equipment Leasing. Equipment Manufacturing and Sales includes sales of Seamap equipment, sales of Klein equipment and sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP. This segment operates from locations near Bristol, United Kingdom, Brisbane, Australia, Salem, New Hampshire and in Singapore.\nOur equipment leasing operations include all leasing activity, sales of lease pool equipment and certain other equipment sales and services related to those operations. This business is conducted from our Huntsville, Texas headquarters and from our locations in Calgary, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Singapore and Ufa, Russia. This includes the operations of our subsidiaries MCL, MEL, MML and MSE, our branch in Colombia and the leasing operations conducted by SAP.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015 and, accordingly, our consolidated results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2016 include only one month of operations from Klein, which amounts were not material.\nIndex to Financial Statements Prior to the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP were included in our leasing segment. Segment operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the revised segment structure.\nManagement believes that the performance of our Equipment Leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment. Management further believes that the performance of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales. Management monitors EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both as defined in the following table, as key indicators of our overall performance and liquidity.\nThe following table presents certain operating information by operating segment:\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\n (1) EBITDA is defined as net income before (a) interest income and interest expense, (b) provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash costs of lease pool equipment sales, certain non-recurring contract settlement costs, impairment of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. This definition of Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definition in the Credit Agreement. We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important indicators for the performance of our business, but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity, and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures, service debt and finance working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement contained financial covenants based on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us. In particular, we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered \nIndex to Financial Statements\n in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA, management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are only two of the measurements that management utilizes. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n (2) Non-recurring contract settlement costs of approximately $2.1 million include approximately $1.8 million of deferred cash payments and approximately $300,000 of stock based compensation.  Within our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, we design, manufacture and sell a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense applications. Seamap's primary products include the (i) GunLink and Digishot seismic source acquisition and control systems, which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools; and (ii) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers (marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel). Klein designs, manufactures and sells side scan sonar and water-side security systems to commercial, governmental and military customers throughout the world. SAP sells equipment, consumable supplies, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia.\nIn our Equipment Leasing segment, we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land, transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide. We provide short-term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer's requirements. All active leases at January 31, 2017 were for a term of less than one year. Seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment. These amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, less accumulated depreciation. From time to time, we sell lease pool equipment to our customers. These sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business. Additionally, when equipment that has been leased to a customer is lost or destroyed, the customer is charged for such equipment at amounts specified in the underlying lease agreement. These charges are included in \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d in the accompanying financial statements. We occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers and provide repair and support services to our rental customers.\nSeismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions. In Canada and Russia, a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months, from December through March or April. During the months in which the weather is warmer, certain areas are not accessible to trucks, earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain. Accordingly, our first and fourth quarters have historically produced higher leasing revenues than the second and third quarters. However, in recent periods the effect of this historical seasonality has been less pronounced due to the general decline in seismic exploration activity in Canada and Russia. In other areas of the world, periods of heavy rain can impair seismic operations. These periods of inclement weather can impact our results of operations; however, there is no historical trend as to the timing of such impact. We are able, in many cases, to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization. Our results of operations, particularly those of our Equipment Leasing segment, can also experience fluctuations in activity levels due to matters unrelated to seasonal or weather factors. These factors include the periodic shift of seismic exploration activity from one geographic region to another and difficulties encountered by our customers due to permitting and other logistical challenges. See Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIndex to Financial Statements Business Outlook\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we experienced a dramatic decline in our Equipment Leasing segment and in that portion of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment related to oil and gas exploration activities. The revenues of our Equipment Leasing segment and to a lesser degree our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment are related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors, which, in turn, are affected by expectations regarding supply and demand for oil and natural gas, energy prices and finding and development costs. The significant decline in global oil prices that occurred during fiscal 2016, we believe, resulted in a corresponding decline in oil and gas exploration activities, particularly seismic exploration programs. Although oil prices have recovered somewhat from their historical lows, prices remain well below historical highs and much uncertainty remains regarding future pricing. The seismic industry in general, and our business in particular, have been negatively affected by the decline in activity noted above.\nAccordingly, we believe a number of factors have negatively affected, and will continue to affect, our business, particularly our Equipment Leasing segment. These factors include reduced demand for seismic services and related equipment, an excess of supply of seismic exploration equipment, increased competition among suppliers of seismic exploration equipment and a reduction in pricing for the sale or rental of both new and used seismic exploration equipment. In recent months we have experienced increased activity in our seismic business in the form of inquiries, bids and proposals. Based on this, we believe this market is improving. However, we believe the improvement will be gradual with only marginal improvement in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 and that it is unlikely that our the financial results of our Equipment Leasing Segment return to levels seen in fiscal 2015 in the foreseeable future.\nWe have implemented a strategy in order to address the changes in circumstances discussed above. This strategy includes the following:\n \u2022 Increased emphasis on our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment. We intend to expand our product offerings with an emphasis on products and services that are not exclusively dependent upon oil and gas exploration activity. We expect new products and services to come from a combination of internally developed products and those acquired from third parties, such as the acquisition of Klein in December 2015. \n \u2022 Redeploy capital from lease pool. We expect our Equipment Leasing Segment to remain an important component of our business. However, we believe there are opportunities to selectively sell certain lease pool assets and redeploy that capital in order to reduce debt, acquire other lease pool assets or invest in other opportunities. \n \u2022 Selectively invest in new lease pool assets. Due to the increased competition and challenging economic conditions in the seismic equipment industry, we intend to limit future acquisitions of lease pool assets to situations that enhance the value of our existing assets or in which we enjoy a competitive advantage due to pricing, operational considerations or exclusivity arrangements. \n \u2022 Utilize our broad geographical footprint. We believe our nine world-wide locations and exposure to a number of different geographical markets provides an advantage over many competitors. \n \u2022 Maintain a capital structure with limited leverage. Historically, we have utilized short-term commercial banking facilities to temporarily finance capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Due to conditions within the oil and gas industry, including our own recent financial results, and associated regulatory pressures, access to such capital has become more limited and may not be available to us in amounts historically available. Accordingly, we intend to reduce our exposure to short-term credit facilities and rely on other sources of expansion capital, and in March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Seamap Credit Facility (as defined below) and cancelled that facility. Such sources could include cash flow provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of lease pool assets, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of equity securities. \nIndex to Financial Statements The market for products sold by Seamap is primarily dependent upon activity within the offshore, or marine, seismic industry, including the re-fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels. However, these products are also utilized by hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels whose activities are not limited to oil and gas related operations. Our Seamap business has benefited from equipping new-build vessels and from re-equipping older vessels with newer, more efficient technology. In addition, as Seamap has expanded its installed base of products, including the product lines purchased in fiscal 2015, our business for replacements, spare parts, repair and support services has expanded. The overall decline in seismic exploration activity has had, and can be expected to continue to have, an impact on the demand for Seamap's products and services. However, we believe the expansion of our product offerings and the desire for customers to upgrade to newer, more efficient technology will mitigate this impact to some extent. We also believe that Seamap has been successful in penetrating new markets recently, partially due to the product lines purchased from ION in fiscal 2015, as evidenced by deliveries to new customers in China during fiscal 2016 and 2017. We continue to have discussions with existing and potential customers regarding new products and enhancement to existing products in order to better meet the needs of the marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic industries.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a manufacturing arrangement with Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (\u201cPGS\u201d), one of the largest marine seismic contractors in the world. Under this arrangement, we manufacture and sell to PGS a customized and proprietary marine energy source controller that is based on our GunLink 4000 product (the \u201cPGS SourceLink\u201d). We have previously collaborated with PGS to develop PGS SourceLink. We expect PGS SourceLink will be deployed on the majority of PGS' fleet of seismic vessels; however, current industry conditions will likely result in a delay in the complete deployment of the new products. The deployment of new products is expected take place over a period of several years.\nWe expect to make additional deliveries to PGS in fiscal 2018 related to the re-equipping of existing vessels. We are also pursuing a number of opportunities in Asia for the equipping of hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels. Some of these opportunities include products from both Seamap and Klein.\nDemand for Klein's products is generally not dependent upon activity within the oil and gas industry. Customers for these products primarily consist of domestic and foreign governmental and military organizations and commercial entities involved in the hydrographic and oceanographic industries. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations as more fully discussed below. However, we believe we are well positioned with recently introduced products and product enhancements and therefore expect revenues from these products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe decline in oil and gas exploration activity in recent years has resulted in a significant decline in the demand for seismic exploration equipment and our equipment rental services. This has also resulted in a material decline in prices for such equipment and services, as much as 50% or more in some cases. While there are indications of improving conditions, we expect such improvement to be marginal and for conditions in the seismic industry to remain challenging through fiscal 2018.\nDemand for the rental of land seismic exploration equipment varies by geographic region. We expect continuing demand in Europe and the Pacific Rim and improving demand in South America during fiscal 2018. We have experienced some increased demand in North America, but such demand has been sporadic and there is much competition in that geographic region. Activity in Russia has been, and is expected to remain, restrained due to economic issues and trade restrictions in that region. We do anticipate opportunities for projects in other parts of the world, including North Africa and The Middle East, some of which could be significant. However, competition for such projects is generally intense and there is no assurance that we will have the opportunity to provide equipment for such projects.\nMarine leasing activity has declined significantly over the past three years. We believe this is due in large part to an excess of equipment in the marine seismic market. As marine contractors have sought to reduce costs by retiring older vessels an excess of used equipment has become available, thereby reducing the demand for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nrental equipment. While we have experienced an increase in inquiries for marine equipment in recent months, we believe this excess of available equipment will continue into fiscal 2018.\nThe demand for downhole seismic equipment was very weak in fiscal 2017. In recent months we have experienced an increase in inquiries for this equipment and have recently commenced certain projects. However, we expect demand for this equipment to remain subdued, increasing marginally during fiscal 2018. This equipment is most often used in applications related to the development of oil and gas properties, such as frac monitoring or reservoir monitoring programs. Accordingly, the degree to which current oil prices and exploration activity influence demand for these products can be different from that for our other equipment.\nThe oil and gas industry, in general, and the seismic industry, in particular, have historically been cyclical businesses. If worldwide oil and gas prices should remain at current depressed levels or decline from current levels, we could see a material change in the level of our business and our income from operations.\nIn response to the decline in demand for our equipment and what we believe to be an excess of equipment in the market, we have significantly reduced our purchases of lease pool equipment from historical levels. During fiscal 2017, we added approximately $441,000 to our lease pool, as compared to approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $11.8 million in fiscal 2015. We expect lease pool additions in fiscal 2018 to be at a level similar to that in fiscal 2017. We expect any such additions will be limited to maintenance of our existing equipment or additional ancillary items that will enhance our ability to lease existing equipment. However, should industry conditions change, or unusual opportunities present themselves, we could revise our planned leased pool additions.\nWe continually monitor the composition of our lease pool in relation to general industry conditions and customer requirements. As a result of this, from time to time we may seek to reduce the amount of certain types of equipment in our lease pool or to completely divest ourselves of certain types of equipment. Sales of lease pool equipment are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d. We also analyze the demand for the types and amount of equipment within various geographic regions and will move equipment among our various locations as warranted.\nHistorically, there have been two or three primary manufacturers of land seismic equipment. Recently, the industry has seen the emergence of additional entities seeking to introduce new equipment, particularly wireless recording equipment. Accordingly, significant competition among these new and existing manufacturers has developed. This competition has, we believe, led to pricing pressure for the manufacturers of equipment. While we benefit from lower prices for new equipment, this situation has had a negative impact on the pricing for our leasing products and services.\nWe believe one of our key competitive advantages is our broad geographic footprint and ability to operate in a number of areas. We have accomplished this over the past several years by establishing subsidiaries and branch operations such that we now operate in nine countries. In response to a decline in activity in some regions, we have taken steps to reduce costs such as by reducing personnel. As a result of reduced activity in Latin America, we decided to close our branch operation in Peru in fiscal 2017. We believe that all opportunities within that region can be more efficiently managed from our branch in Colombia. The impact of this closing has not been material to our results of operations. We will continue to monitor our costs in relation to our activity, but at this time we have no plans to eliminate any of our other operating locations. Should industry conditions improve, or should particular opportunities arise, we may seek to expand our operating locations either by establishing \u201cgreen field\u201d operations or by acquiring other businesses.\nCertain of our customers have experienced delays in payments from their customers or other financial distress. As a result, they have delayed payments to us beyond the originally agreed to terms. We have negotiated extended payment terms or other settlement agreements with some of these customers. In some cases, we have restructured amounts due into secured notes. We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwe estimate to be uncollectable. However, further delays in customer payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues from international customers totaled approximately $34.7 million, $44.5 million and $70.5 million, respectively. These amounts represent 85%, 86% and 85% of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years, respectively. The majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in United States, Australian, Canadian and Singapore dollars and Russian rubles. We have not entered, nor do we intend to enter, into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes.\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years, except as described above.\nResults of Operations\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded operating losses of approximately $31.3 million, $26.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from lower equipment leasing activity. The decrease in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 relates to significantly lower leasing revenue, lower equipment sales, contract settlement costs and impairment of intangible assets. These factors were partially offset by lower lease pool depreciation and general and administrative expenses.\nRevenues and Cost of Sales\nEquipment Manufacturing and Sales\nRevenues and cost of sales for our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment were as follows:\n Demand for Seamap's products is dependent to a large degree upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity; however, a portion of such demand relates to activity within the hydrographic and geotechnical survey industry. A large portion of Seamap's sales consist of large discrete orders, the timing of which is dictated by our customers. This timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed. Accordingly, there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another which does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products. Although recently there has been a\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsoftening of demand within the marine seismic industry in general, we believe that we have continued to experience demand for Seamap's products because operators of marine seismic vessels have been adding newly built vessels to replace older, less efficient vessels and have been upgrading technology on remaining vessels in order to improve operating efficiency. Furthermore, some hydrographic survey operators have continued to increase their capacity and upgrade technology. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, Seamap did experience a decline in demand for its products and a delay in certain projects as marine contractors revised spending plans in response to the decline in oil prices. Many contractors have retired or cold stacked vessels and therefore an excess of equipment has developed. Accordingly, the demand for spare parts and repairs has declined over the past two years. However, based on our backlog of orders as of January 31, 2017 and inquiries from customers, we expect revenue from the sale of Seamap products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The gross profit generated by sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $8.0 million, $10.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. The gross profit margin from the sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 57%, 49% and 51%, respectively. The fluctuations in gross profit margin among the periods were due primarily to changes in product mix.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015, accordingly the operating results related to these operations are not material to fiscal 2016 and the comparison between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is not meaningful. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations. Delays in the completion of engineering and manufacturing activities related to revisions and enhancements to certain products resulted in delays in the availability of these products. Accordingly, expected shipments of these products were delayed. We believe that the aforementioned engineering and manufacturing activities have been essentially completed and that shipment of these products will return to anticipated levels. Therefore, we expect revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2018 to exceed that in fiscal 2017. The gross profit from sale of Klein products was approximately $2.5 million, a gross profit margin of 30%. This margin is less than that normally anticipated due to the effect of certain fixed manufacturing costs and unexpected costs to complete certain projects in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.\nSAP is a distributor and reseller of new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in Australia and throughout the Pacific Rim, including equipment manufactured by Klein and occasionally Seamap. Demand from customers in the Philippines and China, who are most often governmental organizations, has generally been strong over the past three years; however, revenues from year to year can vary significantly due to the timing of discrete orders. The gross profit from the sale of new seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by SAP amounted to approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2017, $650,000 in fiscal 2016, and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015, representing gross profit margins of 23%, 26% and 22%, respectively. The changes in gross profit margins between the years reflect changes in product mix from year to year. The effect of sales from Klein to SAP is eliminated in consolidation and in the table above as \u201cintra-segment sales\u201d.\nAs of January 31, 2017 the backlog of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment was approximately $12.5 million, as compared to approximately $8.7 million as of January 31, 2016. We expect essentially all of these orders to be completed in fiscal 2018. Based on our experience and the lead times for the production of our product, we do not believe backlog as of a particular date is necessarily indicative of future results.\nIndex to Financial Statements Equipment Leasing\nRevenues and cost of sales from our Equipment Leasing segment were comprised of the following:\n Equipment leasing revenues decreased approximately 57% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and 51% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. This downward trend reflects the dramatic decline in oil and gas exploration activity in essentially all geographic regions brought about the decline and uncertainty in world-wide oil prices. Leasing activity in fiscal 2017 declined in all areas except for Canada and Latin America. Fiscal 2017 activity was substantially below that in fiscal 2015 for all areas. The decline in demand for equipment leasing and a decline in the pricing for new seismic exploration equipment have resulted in a reduction in pricing for equipment leasing services. The magnitude of the changes in prices varies significantly from region to region, by the type of equipment and according to the other terms of a particular transaction. However, price reductions in fiscal 2017 of up to 50% as compared to fiscal 2015 and prior pricing have been encountered.\nThe geographic regions with the largest contributions to our land leasing revenues in fiscal 2017 were Latin America, Europe, the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2016 the regions making the largest contributions to leasing revenues were the United States, Europe, Russia and the Pacific Rim.\nRevenues from our downhole lease business were minimal in fiscal 2017 and declined in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting the downturn in the industry and reduced exploration and development expenditures by oil and gas companies.\nRevenues from our marine leasing declined significantly in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and were relatively consistent in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We believe this decline is due in part to consolidation within the marine seismic industry and the retirement or temporary moth-balling of a number of seismic vessels. This has, in our opinion, resulted in an excess of equipment available in the market. We believe this excess of equipment to be temporary but will likely continue into fiscal 2018.\nIn recent weeks we have received an increase in bids and inquiries from customers for the rental of equipment. We believe this could be indicative of a recovery in the seismic exploration market. However, there is no assurance that these bids and inquiries will result in rental contracts and a corresponding increase in our leasing revenues. We believe there remains an excess of equipment available in the seismic industry which will continue to exert negative pressure on demand and pricing for the rental of such equipment.\nIndex to Financial Statements From time to time, we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy capital in other lease pool assets or other business opportunities. These transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and, accordingly, are difficult to predict. Also included in sales of lease pool equipment are charges to leasing customers for lost or destroyed equipment. Due to the recent changes in the seismic equipment market we have implemented a strategy to dispose of certain lease pool equipment. Accordingly, revenue from the sales of lease pool equipment increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. We expect to make additional sales in fiscal 2018. The sale of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2017 resulted in a gross loss of approximately $300,000. The gross profit from the lease pool equipment sales amounted to approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $2.1 million in fiscal 2015. The amount of the gross profit or loss on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment. Based on current negotiations and market conditions, we expect that the sales of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2018 will result in a gross profit.\nOccasionally, we sell other seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers. In addition, we occasionally sell equipment that we produce for use in deploying and retrieving seismic equipment by helicopter and sell certain ancillary marine equipment. The sale of marine equipment may include associated installation services. The sale of other seismic equipment resulted in a gross profit of approximately $271,000 in fiscal 2017, a gross loss of approximately $91,000 in fiscal 2016 and a gross profit of approximately $585,000 in fiscal 2015.\nLease pool depreciation expense for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $25.8 million, as compared to approximately $29.5 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $34.4 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases reflect reduced purchases of lease pool equipment in recent periods. We reduced our lease pool additions in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 in response to industry conditions. We anticipate maintaining a low level of lease pool additions in fiscal 2018. Therefore, as existing assets become fully depreciated and as we sell certain lease pool assets, we expect that lease pool depreciation expense will continue to decline. Depreciation of lease pool equipment commences upon its initial deployment on a lease contract and continues uninterrupted from that point, regardless of whether the equipment is subsequently on a lease contract. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The useful lives of our assets range from two to 10 years. At January 31, 2017, lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately $93.0 million were fully depreciated, yet remained in service. This compares to $72.8 million at January 31, 2016. These assets, though fully depreciated, are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity.\nWe recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal 2017 in the amount of approximately $3.3 million as compared to approximately $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2015. These costs as a percentage of leasing revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 are 32%, 20% and 14%, respectively. Direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues, as the three main components of direct costs are freight, repairs and sublease expense. However, a portion of these costs are fixed, such as warehouse and employee related expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $20.7 million, compared to approximately $19.0 million and $25.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2017 amounts reflect a full-year of activity related to Klein, which we acquired effective December 31, 2015. Without this effect, general and administrative expenses would have declined approximately 6% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The reductions in fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect various cost reduction activities implemented during that year in response to the general downturn in the Company's business. These initiatives include reduced headcount, reduced working hours in some locations, voluntary salary reductions for certain officers and senior managers, lower incentive compensation and lower travel costs.\nDue to the decline in seismic exploration activity, we think it now more likely that certain of our customers will encounter financial difficulties and may be unable to fully satisfy their financial obligations to us. Therefore, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we provided approximately $750,000, $2.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfor doubtful accounts. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, we had trade accounts and note receivables over 90 days past due of approximately $11.7 million and $16.0 million, respectively. In our industry, and in our experience, it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately $5.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively.\nIn September 2015, upon the death of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Billy F. Mitcham, Jr., certain obligations accrued pursuant to his employment contract. The effects of these obligations total approximately $2.1 million and consist of deferred cash payments to his estate of approximately $1.8 million and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation of approximately $300,000.\nDepreciation and amortization, other than lease pool depreciation, relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture, fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2017 and 2016 relates to intangible assets acquired in December 2016 related to Klein and May 2014 in connection with the ION product lines.\nWe periodically evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets, including goodwill. For fiscal 2017, our evaluation did not give an indication of impairment. In fiscal 2016, our evaluation did give an indication of impairment. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2016. Approximately $600,000 of this charge relates to intangible assets related to helipicker assets acquired in fiscal 2011 and approximately $3.0 million relates to goodwill associated with Seamap.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements. Interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal years primarily due to lower average borrowings during those periods.\nOther income and expense relates primarily to net foreign exchange losses and gains. These gains and losses resulted primarily from two situations. Certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the U.S. dollar yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in other currencies. These operations generally have net assets denominated in these other currencies. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against these other currencies, a foreign exchange loss arises and vice versa. In fiscal 2017 we recorded foreign exchange losses of approximately $72,000 related to these situations. In fiscal 2016 we recorded foreign exchange gains of approximately $1.3 million related to these situations. In fiscal 2015, we incurred approximately $1.3 million of exchange losses of this nature primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Colombian Peso. In the second situation, certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the local currency yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in the U.S. dollar. These operations generally have net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, including inter-company obligations. In fiscal 2017, we incurred approximately $339,000 of exchange gains of this type. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of exchange losses of this type, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Russian ruble, Australian dollar, British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. We believe gains and losses of this type are non-cash items and are considered in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 is approximately $1.8 million. This amount differs from that expected when applying the U.S. statutory rate to our loss before income taxes due primarily to recording a valuation allowance against all of the fiscal 2017 increase in our deferred tax assets and the effect of foreign withholding taxes.\nIndex to Financial Statements In fiscal 2016, due to changing economic conditions, we evaluated the recoverability of various deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in various jurisdictions, including the United States. As a result of this evaluation we established a valuation allowance for essentially all deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $15.5 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 we determined to deduct certain prior year foreign tax credits in our U.S. income tax returns, rather than take such amounts as a credit against future taxes. This change in treatment resulted in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $2.6 million. These items are the primary factors causing our total income tax expense in fiscal 2016, which amounted to approximately $11.0 million, to differ from the expected income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34%.\nIn fiscal 2015, our provision for income taxes was a benefit of approximately $1.0 million, which is an effective tax rate of approximately 10%. This is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 34% due primarily to a valuation allowance provided against certain deferred tax assets, the effect of lower average tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign withholding taxes. In fiscal 2015, we evaluated the likelihood of recovery for our deferred tax assets in light of all available positive and negative evidence. As a result of that evaluation, we established a valuation allowance amounting to approximately $1.4 million related to those deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. The principal factor that has affected our cash flow from operating activities is the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above.\nWe believe that our liquidity needs for the next 12 months will be met from cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of lease pool equipment and from proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, taking into account the possible restrictions on funds from our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Seamap Credit Facility and cancelled that facility. We are engaged in discussions with other commercial banks regarding establishing a new revolving credit facility or facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in negotiating any such facilities. Accordingly, we currently do not plan to rely upon proceeds from revolving credit facilities to meet our liquidity and capital needs.\nIn June 2016, we completed an offering of 9.00% cumulative preferred stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The Series A Preferred Stock (i) allows for redemption on at our option (even in the event of a change of control), (ii) does not grant holders with voting control of our Board of Directors, and (iii) provides holders with a conversion option (into common stock) only upon a change of control which upon conversion would be subject to a limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock to be issued.\nShould our needs for liquidity increase, such as to make an acquisition, acquire lease pool assets, or make other investments, we may seek to issue other debt or equity securities.\nIndex to Financial Statements The following table sets forth selected historical information regarding cash flows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of matters affecting the comparability of the above information.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe operate in two segments, Equipment Manufacturing and Sales and Equipment Leasing. Equipment Manufacturing and Sales includes sales of Seamap equipment, sales of Klein equipment and sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP. This segment operates from locations near Bristol, United Kingdom, Brisbane, Australia, Salem, New Hampshire and in Singapore.\nOur equipment leasing operations include all leasing activity, sales of lease pool equipment and certain other equipment sales and services related to those operations. This business is conducted from our Huntsville, Texas headquarters and from our locations in Calgary, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Singapore and Ufa, Russia. This includes the operations of our subsidiaries MCL, MEL, MML and MSE, our branch in Colombia and the leasing operations conducted by SAP.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015 and, accordingly, our consolidated results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2016 include only one month of operations from Klein, which amounts were not material.\nIndex to Financial Statements Prior to the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, sales of oceanographic and hydrographic equipment by SAP were included in our leasing segment. Segment operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the revised segment structure.\nManagement believes that the performance of our Equipment Leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment. Management further believes that the performance of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales. Management monitors EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both as defined in the following table, as key indicators of our overall performance and liquidity.\nThe following table presents certain operating

(b) provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash costs of lease pool equipment sales, certain non-recurring contract settlement costs, impairment of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. This definition of Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the definition in the Credit Agreement. We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important indicators for the performance of our business, but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity, and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures, service debt and finance working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement contained financial covenants based on EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us. In particular, we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered \nIndex to Financial Statements\n in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA, management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are only two of the measurements that management utilizes. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n (2) Non-recurring contract settlement costs of approximately $2.1 million include approximately $1.8 million of deferred cash payments and approximately $300,000 of stock based compensation.  Within our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, we design, manufacture and sell a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense applications. Seamap's primary products include the (i) GunLink and Digishot seismic source acquisition and control systems, which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools; and (ii) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers (marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel). Klein designs, manufactures and sells side scan sonar and water-side security systems to commercial, governmental and military customers throughout the world. SAP sells equipment, consumable supplies, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia.\nIn our Equipment Leasing segment, we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land, transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide. We provide short-term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer's requirements. All active leases at January 31, 2017 were for a term of less than one year. Seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment. These amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment, less accumulated depreciation. From time to time, we sell lease pool equipment to our customers. These sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business. Additionally, when equipment that has been leased to a customer is lost or destroyed, the customer is charged for such equipment at amounts specified in the underlying lease agreement. These charges are included in \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d in the accompanying financial statements. We occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers and provide repair and support services to our rental customers.\nSeismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions. In Canada and Russia, a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months, from December through March or April. During the months in which the weather is warmer, certain areas are not accessible to trucks, earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain. Accordingly, our first and fourth quarters have historically produced higher leasing revenues than the second and third quarters. However, in recent periods the effect of this historical seasonality has been less pronounced due to the general decline in seismic exploration activity in Canada and Russia. In other areas of the world, periods of heavy rain can impair seismic operations. These periods of inclement weather can impact our results of operations; however, there is no historical trend as to the timing of such impact. We are able, in many cases, to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization. Our results of operations, particularly those of our Equipment Leasing segment, can also experience fluctuations in activity levels due to matters unrelated to seasonal or weather factors. These factors include the periodic shift of seismic exploration activity from one geographic region to another and difficulties encountered by our customers due to permitting and other logistical challenges. See Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIndex to Financial Statements Business Outlook\nDuring fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we experienced a dramatic decline in our Equipment Leasing segment and in that portion of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment related to oil and gas exploration activities. The revenues of our Equipment Leasing segment and to a lesser degree our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment are related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors, which, in turn, are affected by expectations regarding supply and demand for oil and natural gas, energy prices and finding and development costs. The significant decline in global oil prices that occurred during fiscal 2016, we believe, resulted in a corresponding decline in oil and gas exploration activities, particularly seismic exploration programs. Although oil prices have recovered somewhat from their historical lows, prices remain well below historical highs and much uncertainty remains regarding future pricing. The seismic industry in general, and our business in particular, have been negatively affected by the decline in activity noted above.\nAccordingly, we believe a number of factors have negatively affected, and will continue to affect, our business, particularly our Equipment Leasing segment. These factors include reduced demand for seismic services and related equipment, an excess of supply of seismic exploration equipment, increased competition among suppliers of seismic exploration equipment and a reduction in pricing for the sale or rental of both new and used seismic exploration equipment. In recent months we have experienced increased activity in our seismic business in the form of inquiries, bids and proposals. Based on this, we believe this market is improving. However, we believe the improvement will be gradual with only marginal improvement in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 and that it is unlikely that our the financial results of our Equipment Leasing Segment return to levels seen in fiscal 2015 in the foreseeable future.\nWe have implemented a strategy in order to address the changes in circumstances discussed above. This strategy includes the following:\n \u2022 Increased emphasis on our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment. We intend to expand our product offerings with an emphasis on products and services that are not exclusively dependent upon oil and gas exploration activity. We expect new products and services to come from a combination of internally developed products and those acquired from third parties, such as the acquisition of Klein in December 2015. \n \u2022 Redeploy capital from lease pool. We expect our Equipment Leasing Segment to remain an important component of our business. However, we believe there are opportunities to selectively sell certain lease pool assets and redeploy that capital in order to reduce debt, acquire other lease pool assets or invest in other opportunities. \n \u2022 Selectively invest in new lease pool assets. Due to the increased competition and challenging economic conditions in the seismic equipment industry, we intend to limit future acquisitions of lease pool assets to situations that enhance the value of our existing assets or in which we enjoy a competitive advantage due to pricing, operational considerations or exclusivity arrangements. \n \u2022 Utilize our broad geographical footprint. We believe our nine world-wide locations and exposure to a number of different geographical markets provides an advantage over many competitors. \n \u2022 Maintain a capital structure with limited leverage. Historically, we have utilized short-term commercial banking facilities to temporarily finance capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Due to conditions within the oil and gas industry, including our own recent financial results, and associated regulatory pressures, access to such capital has become more limited and may not be available to us in amounts historically available. Accordingly, we intend to reduce our exposure to short-term credit facilities and rely on other sources of expansion capital, and in March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under our Seamap Credit Facility (as defined below) and cancelled that facility. Such sources could include cash flow provided by operations, proceeds from the sale of lease pool assets, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of equity securities. \nIndex to Financial Statements The market for products sold by Seamap is primarily dependent upon activity within the offshore, or marine, seismic industry, including the re-fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels. However, these products are also utilized by hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels whose activities are not limited to oil and gas related operations. Our Seamap business has benefited from equipping new-build vessels and from re-equipping older vessels with newer, more efficient technology. In addition, as Seamap has expanded its installed base of products, including the product lines purchased in fiscal 2015, our business for replacements, spare parts, repair and support services has expanded. The overall decline in seismic exploration activity has had, and can be expected to continue to have, an impact on the demand for Seamap's products and services. However, we believe the expansion of our product offerings and the desire for customers to upgrade to newer, more efficient technology will mitigate this impact to some extent. We also believe that Seamap has been successful in penetrating new markets recently, partially due to the product lines purchased from ION in fiscal 2015, as evidenced by deliveries to new customers in China during fiscal 2016 and 2017. We continue to have discussions with existing and potential customers regarding new products and enhancement to existing products in order to better meet the needs of the marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic industries.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a manufacturing arrangement with Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (\u201cPGS\u201d), one of the largest marine seismic contractors in the world. Under this arrangement, we manufacture and sell to PGS a customized and proprietary marine energy source controller that is based on our GunLink 4000 product (the \u201cPGS SourceLink\u201d). We have previously collaborated with PGS to develop PGS SourceLink. We expect PGS SourceLink will be deployed on the majority of PGS' fleet of seismic vessels; however, current industry conditions will likely result in a delay in the complete deployment of the new products. The deployment of new products is expected take place over a period of several years.\nWe expect to make additional deliveries to PGS in fiscal 2018 related to the re-equipping of existing vessels. We are also pursuing a number of opportunities in Asia for the equipping of hydrographic and geotechnical survey vessels. Some of these opportunities include products from both Seamap and Klein.\nDemand for Klein's products is generally not dependent upon activity within the oil and gas industry. Customers for these products primarily consist of domestic and foreign governmental and military organizations and commercial entities involved in the hydrographic and oceanographic industries. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations as more fully discussed below. However, we believe we are well positioned with recently introduced products and product enhancements and therefore expect revenues from these products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe decline in oil and gas exploration activity in recent years has resulted in a significant decline in the demand for seismic exploration equipment and our equipment rental services. This has also resulted in a material decline in prices for such equipment and services, as much as 50% or more in some cases. While there are indications of improving conditions, we expect such improvement to be marginal and for conditions in the seismic industry to remain challenging through fiscal 2018.\nDemand for the rental of land seismic exploration equipment varies by geographic region. We expect continuing demand in Europe and the Pacific Rim and improving demand in South America during fiscal 2018. We have experienced some increased demand in North America, but such demand has been sporadic and there is much competition in that geographic region. Activity in Russia has been, and is expected to remain, restrained due to economic issues and trade restrictions in that region. We do anticipate opportunities for projects in other parts of the world, including North Africa and The Middle East, some of which could be significant. However, competition for such projects is generally intense and there is no assurance that we will have the opportunity to provide equipment for such projects.\nMarine leasing activity has declined significantly over the past three years. We believe this is due in large part to an excess of equipment in the marine seismic market. As marine contractors have sought to reduce costs by retiring older vessels an excess of used equipment has become available, thereby reducing the demand for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nrental equipment. While we have experienced an increase in inquiries for marine equipment in recent months, we believe this excess of available equipment will continue into fiscal 2018.\nThe demand for downhole seismic equipment was very weak in fiscal 2017. In recent months we have experienced an increase in inquiries for this equipment and have recently commenced certain projects. However, we expect demand for this equipment to remain subdued, increasing marginally during fiscal 2018. This equipment is most often used in applications related to the development of oil and gas properties, such as frac monitoring or reservoir monitoring programs. Accordingly, the degree to which current oil prices and exploration activity influence demand for these products can be different from that for our other equipment.\nThe oil and gas industry, in general, and the seismic industry, in particular, have historically been cyclical businesses. If worldwide oil and gas prices should remain at current depressed levels or decline from current levels, we could see a material change in the level of our business and our income from operations.\nIn response to the decline in demand for our equipment and what we believe to be an excess of equipment in the market, we have significantly reduced our purchases of lease pool equipment from historical levels. During fiscal 2017, we added approximately $441,000 to our lease pool, as compared to approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $11.8 million in fiscal 2015. We expect lease pool additions in fiscal 2018 to be at a level similar to that in fiscal 2017. We expect any such additions will be limited to maintenance of our existing equipment or additional ancillary items that will enhance our ability to lease existing equipment. However, should industry conditions change, or unusual opportunities present themselves, we could revise our planned leased pool additions.\nWe continually monitor the composition of our lease pool in relation to general industry conditions and customer requirements. As a result of this, from time to time we may seek to reduce the amount of certain types of equipment in our lease pool or to completely divest ourselves of certain types of equipment. Sales of lease pool equipment are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as \u201cLease pool equipment sales\u201d. We also analyze the demand for the types and amount of equipment within various geographic regions and will move equipment among our various locations as warranted.\nHistorically, there have been two or three primary manufacturers of land seismic equipment. Recently, the industry has seen the emergence of additional entities seeking to introduce new equipment, particularly wireless recording equipment. Accordingly, significant competition among these new and existing manufacturers has developed. This competition has, we believe, led to pricing pressure for the manufacturers of equipment. While we benefit from lower prices for new equipment, this situation has had a negative impact on the pricing for our leasing products and services.\nWe believe one of our key competitive advantages is our broad geographic footprint and ability to operate in a number of areas. We have accomplished this over the past several years by establishing subsidiaries and branch operations such that we now operate in nine countries. In response to a decline in activity in some regions, we have taken steps to reduce costs such as by reducing personnel. As a result of reduced activity in Latin America, we decided to close our branch operation in Peru in fiscal 2017. We believe that all opportunities within that region can be more efficiently managed from our branch in Colombia. The impact of this closing has not been material to our results of operations. We will continue to monitor our costs in relation to our activity, but at this time we have no plans to eliminate any of our other operating locations. Should industry conditions improve, or should particular opportunities arise, we may seek to expand our operating locations either by establishing \u201cgreen field\u201d operations or by acquiring other businesses.\nCertain of our customers have experienced delays in payments from their customers or other financial distress. As a result, they have delayed payments to us beyond the originally agreed to terms. We have negotiated extended payment terms or other settlement agreements with some of these customers. In some cases, we have restructured amounts due into secured notes. We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts\nIndex to Financial Statements\nwe estimate to be uncollectable. However, further delays in customer payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues from international customers totaled approximately $34.7 million, $44.5 million and $70.5 million, respectively. These amounts represent 85%, 86% and 85% of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years, respectively. The majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in United States, Australian, Canadian and Singapore dollars and Russian rubles. We have not entered, nor do we intend to enter, into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes.\nOur revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years, except as described above.\nResults of Operations\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded operating losses of approximately $31.3 million, $26.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from lower equipment leasing activity. The decrease in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 relates to significantly lower leasing revenue, lower equipment sales, contract settlement costs and impairment of intangible assets. These factors were partially offset by lower lease pool depreciation and general and administrative expenses.\nRevenues and Cost of Sales\nEquipment Manufacturing and Sales\nRevenues and cost of sales for our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment were as follows:\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seamap\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Klein\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,067 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intra-segment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,978 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seamap\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Klein\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intra-segment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,869 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,223 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,649 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Demand for Seamap's products is dependent to a large degree upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity; however, a portion of such demand relates to activity within the hydrographic and geotechnical survey industry. A large portion of Seamap's sales consist of large discrete orders, the timing of which is dictated by our customers. This timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed. Accordingly, there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another which does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products. Although recently there has been a\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsoftening of demand within the marine seismic industry in general, we believe that we have continued to experience demand for Seamap's products because operators of marine seismic vessels have been adding newly built vessels to replace older, less efficient vessels and have been upgrading technology on remaining vessels in order to improve operating efficiency. Furthermore, some hydrographic survey operators have continued to increase their capacity and upgrade technology. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, Seamap did experience a decline in demand for its products and a delay in certain projects as marine contractors revised spending plans in response to the decline in oil prices. Many contractors have retired or cold stacked vessels and therefore an excess of equipment has developed. Accordingly, the demand for spare parts and repairs has declined over the past two years. However, based on our backlog of orders as of January 31, 2017 and inquiries from customers, we expect revenue from the sale of Seamap products to increase in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The gross profit generated by sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $8.0 million, $10.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. The gross profit margin from the sales of Seamap equipment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 57%, 49% and 51%, respectively. The fluctuations in gross profit margin among the periods were due primarily to changes in product mix.\nWe acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015, accordingly the operating results related to these operations are not material to fiscal 2016 and the comparison between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is not meaningful. Revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2017 was below our expectations. Delays in the completion of engineering and manufacturing activities related to revisions and enhancements to certain products resulted in delays in the availability of these products. Accordingly, expected shipments of these products were delayed. We believe that the aforementioned engineering and manufacturing activities have been essentially completed and that shipment of these products will return to anticipated levels. Therefore, we expect revenue from the sale of Klein products in fiscal 2018 to exceed that in fiscal 2017. The gross profit from sale of Klein products was approximately $2.5 million, a gross profit margin of 30%. This margin is less than that normally anticipated due to the effect of certain fixed manufacturing costs and unexpected costs to complete certain projects in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.\nSAP is a distributor and reseller of new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in Australia and throughout the Pacific Rim, including equipment manufactured by Klein and occasionally Seamap. Demand from customers in the Philippines and China, who are most often governmental organizations, has generally been strong over the past three years; however, revenues from year to year can vary significantly due to the timing of discrete orders. The gross profit from the sale of new seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by SAP amounted to approximately $1.1 million in fiscal 2017, $650,000 in fiscal 2016, and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015, representing gross profit margins of 23%, 26% and 22%, respectively. The changes in gross profit margins between the years reflect changes in product mix from year to year. The effect of sales from Klein to SAP is eliminated in consolidation and in the table above as \u201cintra-segment sales\u201d.\nAs of January 31, 2017 the backlog of our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment was approximately $12.5 million, as compared to approximately $8.7 million as of January 31, 2016. We expect essentially all of these orders to be completed in fiscal 2018. Based on our experience and the lead times for the production of our product, we do not believe backlog as of a particular date is necessarily indicative of future results.\nIndex to Financial Statements Equipment Leasing\nRevenues and cost of sales from our Equipment Leasing segment were comprised of the following:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,299 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease pool equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease pool depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct costs - equipment leasing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,689 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of lease pool equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of other equipment sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross (loss) profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,902 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,238 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross (loss) profit margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(119 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Equipment leasing revenues decreased approximately 57% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and 51% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. This downward trend reflects the dramatic decline in oil and gas exploration activity in essentially all geographic regions brought about the decline and uncertainty in world-wide oil prices. Leasing activity in fiscal 2017 declined in all areas except for Canada and Latin America. Fiscal 2017 activity was substantially below that in fiscal 2015 for all areas. The decline in demand for equipment leasing and a decline in the pricing for new seismic exploration equipment have resulted in a reduction in pricing for equipment leasing services. The magnitude of the changes in prices varies significantly from region to region, by the type of equipment and according to the other terms of a particular transaction. However, price reductions in fiscal 2017 of up to 50% as compared to fiscal 2015 and prior pricing have been encountered.\nThe geographic regions with the largest contributions to our land leasing revenues in fiscal 2017 were Latin America, Europe, the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2016 the regions making the largest contributions to leasing revenues were the United States, Europe, Russia and the Pacific Rim.\nRevenues from our downhole lease business were minimal in fiscal 2017 and declined in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting the downturn in the industry and reduced exploration and development expenditures by oil and gas companies.\nRevenues from our marine leasing declined significantly in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and were relatively consistent in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We believe this decline is due in part to consolidation within the marine seismic industry and the retirement or temporary moth-balling of a number of seismic vessels. This has, in our opinion, resulted in an excess of equipment available in the market. We believe this excess of equipment to be temporary but will likely continue into fiscal 2018.\nIn recent weeks we have received an increase in bids and inquiries from customers for the rental of equipment. We believe this could be indicative of a recovery in the seismic exploration market. However, there is no assurance that these bids and inquiries will result in rental contracts and a corresponding increase in our leasing revenues. We believe there remains an excess of equipment available in the seismic industry which will continue to exert negative pressure on demand and pricing for the rental of such equipment.\nIndex to Financial Statements From time to time, we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy capital in other lease pool assets or other business opportunities. These transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and, accordingly, are difficult to predict. Also included in sales of lease pool equipment are charges to leasing customers for lost or destroyed equipment. Due to the recent changes in the seismic equipment market we have implemented a strategy to dispose of certain lease pool equipment. Accordingly, revenue from the sales of lease pool equipment increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. We expect to make additional sales in fiscal 2018. The sale of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2017 resulted in a gross loss of approximately $300,000. The gross profit from the lease pool equipment sales amounted to approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $2.1 million in fiscal 2015. The amount of the gross profit or loss on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment. Based on current negotiations and market conditions, we expect that the sales of lease pool equipment in fiscal 2018 will result in a gross profit.\nOccasionally, we sell other seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers. In addition, we occasionally sell equipment that we produce for use in deploying and retrieving seismic equipment by helicopter and sell certain ancillary marine equipment. The sale of marine equipment may include associated installation services. The sale of other seismic equipment resulted in a gross profit of approximately $271,000 in fiscal 2017, a gross loss of approximately $91,000 in fiscal 2016 and a gross profit of approximately $585,000 in fiscal 2015.\nLease pool depreciation expense for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $25.8 million, as compared to approximately $29.5 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $34.4 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases reflect reduced purchases of lease pool equipment in recent periods. We reduced our lease pool additions in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 in response to industry conditions. We anticipate maintaining a low level of lease pool additions in fiscal 2018. Therefore, as existing assets become fully depreciated and as we sell certain lease pool assets, we expect that lease pool depreciation expense will continue to decline. Depreciation of lease pool equipment commences upon its initial deployment on a lease contract and continues uninterrupted from that point, regardless of whether the equipment is subsequently on a lease contract. The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The useful lives of our assets range from two to 10 years. At January 31, 2017, lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately $93.0 million were fully depreciated, yet remained in service. This compares to $72.8 million at January 31, 2016. These assets, though fully depreciated, are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity.\nWe recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal 2017 in the amount of approximately $3.3 million as compared to approximately $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 and approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2015. These costs as a percentage of leasing revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 are 32%, 20% and 14%, respectively. Direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues, as the three main components of direct costs are freight, repairs and sublease expense. However, a portion of these costs are fixed, such as warehouse and employee related expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 amounted to approximately $20.7 million, compared to approximately $19.0 million and $25.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2017 amounts reflect a full-year of activity related to Klein, which we acquired effective December 31, 2015. Without this effect, general and administrative expenses would have declined approximately 6% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The reductions in fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect various cost reduction activities implemented during that year in response to the general downturn in the Company's business. These initiatives include reduced headcount, reduced working hours in some locations, voluntary salary reductions for certain officers and senior managers, lower incentive compensation and lower travel costs.\nDue to the decline in seismic exploration activity, we think it now more likely that certain of our customers will encounter financial difficulties and may be unable to fully satisfy their financial obligations to us. Therefore, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we provided approximately $750,000, $2.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfor doubtful accounts. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, we had trade accounts and note receivables over 90 days past due of approximately $11.7 million and $16.0 million, respectively. In our industry, and in our experience, it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately $5.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively.\nIn September 2015, upon the death of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Billy F. Mitcham, Jr., certain obligations accrued pursuant to his employment contract. The effects of these obligations total approximately $2.1 million and consist of deferred cash payments to his estate of approximately $1.8 million and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation of approximately $300,000.\nDepreciation and amortization, other than lease pool depreciation, relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture, fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2017 and 2016 relates to intangible assets acquired in December 2016 related to Klein and May 2014 in connection with the ION product lines.\nWe periodically evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets, including goodwill. For fiscal 2017, our evaluation did not give an indication of impairment. In fiscal 2016, our evaluation did give an indication of impairment. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2016. Approximately $600,000 of this charge relates to intangible assets related to helipicker assets acquired in fiscal 2011 and approximately $3.0 million relates to goodwill associated with Seamap.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements. Interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal years primarily due to lower average borrowings during those periods.\nOther income and expense relates primarily to net foreign exchange losses and gains. These gains and losses resulted primarily from two situations. Certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the U.S. dollar yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in other currencies. These operations generally have net assets denominated in these other currencies. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against these other currencies, a foreign exchange loss arises and vice versa. In fiscal 2017 we recorded foreign exchange losses of approximately $72,000 related to these situations. In fiscal 2016 we recorded foreign exchange gains of approximately $1.3 million related to these situations. In fiscal 2015, we incurred approximately $1.3 million of exchange losses of this nature primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Colombian Peso. In the second situation, certain of our foreign operations have a functional currency of the local currency yet have cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in the U.S. dollar. These operations generally have net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, including inter-company obligations. In fiscal 2017, we incurred approximately $339,000 of exchange gains of this type. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of exchange losses of this type, primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Russian ruble, Australian dollar, British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. We believe gains and losses of this type are non-cash items and are considered in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 is approximately $1.8 million. This amount differs from that expected when applying the U.S. statutory rate to our loss before income taxes due primarily to recording a valuation allowance against all of the fiscal 2017 increase in our deferred tax assets and the effect of foreign withholding taxes.\nIndex to Financial Statements In fiscal 2016, due to changing economic conditions, we evaluated the recoverability of various deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in various jurisdictions, including the United States. As a result of this evaluation we established a valuation allowance for essentially all deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $15.5 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 we determined to deduct certain prior year foreign tax credits in our U.S. income tax returns, rather than take such amounts as a credit against future taxes. This change in treatment resulted in an increase in deferred income tax expense of approximately $2.6 million. These items are the primary factors causing our total income tax expense in fiscal 2016, which amounted to approximately $11.0 million, to differ from the expected income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 34%.\nIn fiscal 2015, our provision for income taxes was a benefit of approximately $1.0 million, which is an effective tax rate of approximately 10%. This is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 34% due primarily to a valuation allowance provided against certain deferred tax assets, the effect of lower average tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign withholding taxes. In fiscal 2015, we evaluated the likelihood of recovery for our deferred tax assets in light of all available positive and negative evidence. As a result of that evaluation, we established a valuation allowance amounting to approximately $1.4 million related to those deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, the Credit Agreement and the Seamap Credit Facility. The principal factor that has affected our cash flow from operating activities is the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above.\nWe believe that our liquidity needs for the next 12 months will be met from cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of lease pool equipment and from proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, taking into account the possible restrictions on funds from our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn March 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and terminated that agreement. Also, on April 5, 2017, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Seamap Credit Facility and cancelled that facility. We are engaged in discussions with other commercial banks regarding establishing a new revolving credit facility or facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in negotiating any such facilities. Accordingly, we currently do not plan to rely upon proceeds from revolving credit facilities to meet our liquidity and capital needs.\nIn June 2016, we completed an offering of 9.00% cumulative preferred stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The Series A Preferred Stock (i) allows for redemption on at our option (even in the event of a change of control), (ii) does not grant holders with voting control of our Board of Directors, and (iii) provides holders with a conversion option (into common stock) only upon a change of control which upon conversion would be subject to a limit on the maximum number of shares of common stock to be issued.\nShould our needs for liquidity increase, such as to make an acquisition, acquire lease pool assets, or make other investments, we may seek to issue other debt or equity securities.\nIndex to Financial Statements The following table sets forth selected historical information regarding cash flows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended January 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015"}
