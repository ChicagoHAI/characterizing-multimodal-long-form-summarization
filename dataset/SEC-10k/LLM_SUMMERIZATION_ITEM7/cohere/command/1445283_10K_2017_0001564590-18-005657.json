Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an innovative, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics to treat cystic fibrosis, or CF, and other diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company focuses on identifying therapies that restore protein function. CF is a disease caused by defects in the function or abundance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. Our CF focused pipeline consists of novel CFTR modulators including correctors, potentiators and amplifiers. Upon discovery of amplifiers, a novel class of CFTR modulators, we have exploited its novel mechanism of action as a drug screening tool and have subsequently identified correctors and potentiators to be developed as part of combination therapies. Investigational agents representative of all three classes of CFTR modulators are currently in clinical development and include PTI-428, an amplifier, and PTI-801 a third generation corrector, both of which we believe are amenable for add-on therapy to standard-of-care CFTR modulator treatment and PTI-808, a potentiator intended to be developed as part of a dual combination with PTI-801 and a triple combination that also includes PTI-428 and PTI-801. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize our own therapies, including add-on and combination therapies for CF patients who have at least onedel mutation, representing the majority of the patient population.\nThere is presently no cure for CF. CF affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide with the vast majority of the diagnosed patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is a progressive disease and the most common fatal inherited disease among Caucasians. Without normal CFTR protein activity, thick mucus accumulates in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and causes many complications, including respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, and frequent hospitalizations. In 2016, the median age of death in the United States from CF was 30 years.\nThe approval of CFTR modulator based therapy, consisting of a potentiator and a combination of a potentiator and a corrector, has validated the clinical benefit of a small molecule pharmacological approach to improve CFTR function and has become a standard of care for eligible CF patients. These developments have spurred drug discovery and development initiatives that include a combinational approach of multiple modulators. To our knowledge there are only two pharmaceutical companies currently developing combined uses of three CFTR modulators whose goal is the restoration of CFTR protein activity in CF patients by using one potentiator and two corrector molecules. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or tezacaftor, are believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve a higher level of activity without repairing the actual protein mutation. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane.\nUnlike other triple combination drug discovery and development approaches for CF that are based on potentiators and correctors, our program includes PTI-428, an amplifier, a novel CFTR modulator with unique and distinguished molecular properties. PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking, function and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized unfolded form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Using industry-standard in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that co-administration of PTI-428 with correctors and potentiators significantly improves the in vitro CFTR protein activity achieved by these CFTR modulators alone.\nDue to the unique ability of amplifiers to selectively increase the amount of the unfolded form of CFTR protein and its synergistic mechanism of action with certain other types of CFTR modulators, we believe that PTI-428 could become the anchor therapeutic agent for combination therapies comprising multiple classes of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF. A triple combination regimen that includes PTI-428 with PTI-801, a corrector, and PTI-808, a potentiator, has been shown to restore in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal, in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells homozygous fordel.\nWith the recent advent of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care, which addresses only the symptoms of CF, to disease-modifying agents that target the genetic cause of the disease or the mutated CFTR protein. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize a proprietary combination therapy for patients with andel mutation of the CFTR gene, the most common CFTR gene mutation. In the United States, approximately 86% of all CF patients have andel mutation of the CFTR gene, of which approximately 53% are homozygous (having two copies of thedel mutation), and approximately 47% are heterozygous (having andel mutation and one other mutation).\nWe and others have analyzed published data by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, on its CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and the correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) and combinations thereof, which show a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity and lung function improvement. We have shown in vitro that PTI-428 increases the amount of available CFTR protein and, when combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles the CFTR protein activity in the cell compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor. In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial in CF patients and healthy volunteers in the first half of 2016. The Phase 1 trial in CF patients included single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. We reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker data from SAD and MAD cohorts in the PTI-428 Phase 1 clinical trial in CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) as their background, standard of care therapy, as well as a cohort of CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days who were not taking CFTR modulator based therapies.\nWe have completed a 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial for PTI-428 in CF patients randomized to receive either PTI-428 or placebo for 28 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae as their background, standard of care therapy to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg of once-a-day PTI-428. In December of 2017, we announced the results of the study which showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi\u00ae demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p\u22640.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p\u22640.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing.\nIn CF subjects on Orkambi\u00ae therapy, it has been shown in two registrational Phase 3 studies that the magnitude of response to Orkambi varied according to patient lung function at screening suggesting that the overall efficacy captured in these studies was mainly driven by the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 below 70% (+3.3 percentage points) while the changes in the group with FEV1 \u226570% were not statistically significant. A similar analysis was performed in our 28-day study with PTI-428 and it showed an average +6.6 percentage points (p<0.05) increase in absolute ppFEV1 compared to placebo for patients who had lower baseline ppFEV1 value (<70%). The results of the subgroup analysis are consistent with Phase 3 data with Orkambi\u00ae, suggesting that PTI-428 potentially amplifies the Orkambi\u00ae effect in the responder population.\nAdditional endpoints in the study included measurement of changes in sweat chloride (secondary endpoint) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelia (exploratory endpoint). In this study, a positive increase in CFTR protein from baseline was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in an in vitro human bronchial cell (HBE) cell model. In contrast, changes in sweat chloride did not correlate with changes in lung function.\nIn the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and there were two adverse events, or AEs, that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi\u00ae only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously.\nIn March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for thedel mutation who are receiving Orkambi\u00ae as background therapy. The designation was based on the FDA's review of available clinical evidence, including the observed increase in FEV1 and CFTR protein levels in the 28-day study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. The FDA grants orphan designation to promote the development of product candidates for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients annually. This designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of certain administrative filing fees.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-801, a corrector molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017 and is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017.\nWe have initiated a 14-day once-a-day dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi\u00ae therapy. In December of 2017, we reported initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and one placebo) of the first dose level tested. All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor. There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related. Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. This study, designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, is ongoing.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 and is now active. PTI-808 has completed investigation in 48 healthy volunteers with up to 300 mg in single and multiple dose cohorts. PTI-808 was found to be generally well tolerated. One subject experienced a serious adverse event from a pre-existing condition of transverse myelitis. This serious adverse event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. All other adverse events that have been reported to date were of mild or moderate severity. Preliminary PK assessment of PTI-808 suggests that it could potentially be suitable for once daily dosing.\nCo-administration of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 has been completed in 20 healthy volunteer subjects. Safety and PK profiles achieved with seven days of once-a-day oral dosing of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 indicated these compounds were generally well-tolerated and could potentially be amenable for once a day dosing. No SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. The PK data demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.\nCombination study protocols for trials in CF patients have been reviewed by key patient advocacy and regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. In January of 2018, we announced that our triple combination clinical study protocol received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.\nIn 2018, we aim to (1) produce additional data from our 14-day study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi in the first half, (2) continue dosing CF patients in a double combination trial consisting of\nPTI-801 and PTI-808, and produce initial data by mid-year, (3) initiate a triple combination of our proprietary agents PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in the first half, and produce preliminary data in the second half and (4) initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in patients on background Symdeko in the second half with initial data in early 2019.\nWe have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, as well as our proprietary combinations. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for add-on therapies based on PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in regions where ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and ivacaftor and tezacaftor, as applicable) are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in those regions. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement.\nIn addition to our wholly owned CF programs, we have partnered with a major pharmaceutical company, Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, on our unfolded protein response, or UPR, program. The UPR program is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. In August 2016, we announced the achievement of a preclinical milestone by demonstrating that selective modulation of the UPR pathway is an effective disease-modifying approach in the treatment of multiple diseases with few or no therapies currently available.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, proceeds from our initial public offering in February 2016, proceeds from our follow-on public offerings in September 2016 and December 2017, and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements and a research grant.\nOn February 10, 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $42.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on February 11, 2016, all outstanding shares of the Company's convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 9,699,600 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,590,742 common shares were issued for payment of $36.0 million of accruing dividends due to the holders of Series A preferred stock.\nIn September 2016, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $13.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $69.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.5 million and other offering expenses of $0.8 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nOn October 31, 2017, we determined to focus our resources on research and clinical development of our cystic fibrosis programs, as well as supporting our collaboration with Astellas. Accordingly, we reduced headcount dedicated to research from 46% of the total workforce to 34% through the elimination of 13 positions. As a result of this action, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, we estimated annualized savings of approximately $3.0 million, with one-time severance and related costs of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn December 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $42.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.3 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to\npurchase an additional 1,200,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $59.4 million and $37.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $216.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expand and/or advance our add-on and proprietary combination therapy candidates, PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, into Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek support and approval from our collaboration partners, the TDN and other interested parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire personnel to support our product development, manufacturing, commercialization and administrative efforts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> advance the research and development efforts of our CF and other product candidates, including, without limitation, back-up compounds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs going forward associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of public or private equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements, based upon our current operating plan, into early 2019. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Primarily all of our revenue to date has been derived from our collaboration agreements with Astellas and Biogen (and the Biogen agreement is now terminated).\nUnder the Astellas collaboration agreement, entered into in November 2014, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million, $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize revenue from all upfront payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the three and a half-year research term, which commenced in January 2015, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Astellas collaboration agreement totaled $1.1 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn May 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment, effective as of January 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. In connection with such amendment, in June 2016 we received a payment of $1.0 million to conduct certain experiments during the period from February 1, 2016 through July 31, 2016. During this period, we did not receive any other payment or reimbursement under the agreement. The payment is being recognized over the research term of the agreement with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned. In July 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment effective as of July 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. as a result of achieving a pre-clinical milestone and are progressing to the optimization phase. The amendment provides for the Joint Research Committee to evaluate progress at various intervals throughout the optimization phase. In connection with the amendment, the Company received a $0.8 million non-substantive milestone payment which is being recognized, over the three and a half-year research term of the agreement, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term.\nUnder the Biogen collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.2 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not recognize revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the termination of the agreement effective December 6, 2016. Through this date, we recognized revenue from all upfront license payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the four-year research term, which commenced in December 2013, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement totaled $5.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Upon termination of the agreement, we recognized the remaining $3.1 million of deferred revenue. We do not have any deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and we will not recognize any additional revenue under this terminated agreement in the future.\nWe expect that any future revenue recognized under the Astellas collaboration agreement will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the uncertain timing of future milestone payments and the uncertain quantity of our research services provided from quarter to quarter. Further, subject to the terms and conditions of our collaboration agreements, our collaborators have certain unilateral rights to discontinue their participation in the research activities and, as a result, future payments to us under the agreements. Additionally, we expect our revenue recognition in the statement of operations and our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet to change upon the adoption of new revenue accounting guidance, ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of 2018, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which include costs of research services incurred in connection with our collaboration agreements and research grant, consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments made under third-party licensing agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, central laboratories, contractors and CROs in connection with our preclinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our platform technology and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources to manage our preclinical development activities and perform data analysis for such activities. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing clinical trials and other preclinical development activities. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs for completing the clinical development of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, or any of our combination therapies, for the treatment of CF or the cost associated with the development of any of our other product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cooperation and approval we receive from third parties including clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, the TDN and CTN;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant and changing government regulation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables, or others identified within this filing, with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or\nother testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, patent, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs and director expenses, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Prior to 2016, our interest income was not significant due to nominal cash balances and low interest earned on the cash balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on $15.0 million in convertible promissory notes we issued during 2015, all of which notes and accrued interest were converted into Series B preferred stock in September 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair values of our preferred stock warrant liability, our derivative liability and amortization/accretion on our short-term investments. We previously issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A preferred stock that we believe is a financial instrument that may require a transfer of assets because of the redemption features of the underlying stock. Therefore, we had classified this warrant as a liability that we had remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we had recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our initial public offering in February 2016, the underlying convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrant became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The derivative liability relates to a cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement, which meets the definition of a derivative. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) tax reform legislation. The legislation resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% down to a flat rate of 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit.\nAs a result of the enacted tax law, the Company has revalued the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate. The revaluation resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $24.0 million with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance and therefore no net effect on the 2017 tax provision affecting the Company's statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $196.9 million and $182.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $6.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2026, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria.\nDeferred revenue not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is reported as non-current deferred revenue.\nWe will adopt new revenue accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which we expect to impact this policy, the amount and timing of our future revenue recognition, and the amount of revenue previously recognized in our published financial statements. For further discussion, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaborative Research and License Agreements\nThe terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The arrangement consideration from these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, reimbursement of certain third-party costs, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue\nwill be recognized. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.\nThe consideration received under the arrangement that is fixed or determinable is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight- line basis over the period we are expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, with a cumulative catch-up being for the elapsed portion of the research term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of\nservice performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met. However, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> contract manufacturers in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock option awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option- pricing model.\nWe do not recognize compensation expense for awards with performance-based vesting conditions granted to consultants and non-employees for which satisfaction of the performance conditions is not solely within the control of the holder until the performance conditions have been met.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our February 11, 2016 initial public offering, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Accordingly, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and non-employees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the\nU.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nValuation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nWe have issued a freestanding warrant exercisable for shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock. These warrants were classified as a liability in the accompanying balance sheets prior to the completion of our IPO in February 2016, as the terms for liquidation of the underlying security were outside our control. The warrant was recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with any changes in fair value being recognized in other income (expense), net in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We ceased the remeasurement of the fair value of the convertible warrant liability upon the conversion of the warrant to a common stock warrant, which occurred upon the completion of our IPO on February 11, 2016. Subsequent to such conversion, the warrant is classified as a component of stockholders' equity and is no longer subject to remeasurement. These warrants were exercised in 2017 and none are outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of Derivative Liability\nWe identified an embedded derivative resulting from the cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement. Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying host instrument are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis, which incorporates assumptions and estimates to value the derivative instrument. We assess these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value of our common stock, expected term of the derivative instrument, expected volatility of the common stock price, risk-free interest rate, expected sales-based milestone payments, discount rate, probability of a change of control event, and the probability that the counterparty would elect to accept the alternative cash payment in lieu of its right to the future sales-based milestone payments. We determine the per share fair value of the underlying stock price by taking into consideration recent factors we deem relevant. We estimate the expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a one-year term. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a one-year term. We estimate the expected sales-based milestone payments based on four times the maximum research funding allowable under the CFFT collaboration agreement plus the expected achievement of certain milestones. We estimate the discount rate in the calculation of the present value of the expected future milestone payments based on expected returns of alternative investments of a similar type. We estimate the probability of a change of control event by taking into consideration recent developments.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company\u201d, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and\ncomparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering in February 2016 or until we no longer meet the other requirements for being an emerging growth company,\u201d whichever occurs first.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (220\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59,973\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (59,432\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.1 million was the result of a decrease of $5.2 million in revenue recognized from our now-terminated collaboration with Biogen and an increase of $2.1 million in revenue recognized from our collaboration with Astellas.\nUnder our Biogen collaboration agreement, we did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.2 million revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenue from Biogen was the result of the termination of the collaboration agreement which resulted in the recognition of all previously deferred revenue in December 2016.\nUnder our Astellas collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue from the Astellas collaboration was the result of additional reimbursement revenue earned in 2017. Payments received under the agreement are recognized as revenue over the research term, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including stock-based\ncompensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $19.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in costs incurred in advancing the clinical trials of our CF program, as PTI-428 advanced into Phase 2 clinical trials, PTI-801 and PTI-808 initiated Phase 1 clinical trials, and we initiated combination trials. The overall increase in research and development expenses was also due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $4.4 million resulting from an average increase in the headcount of research and development employees from year to year, including an increase of $0.7 million in employee stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were essentially flat compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income\nWe recorded $0.6 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $0.4 million was due to interest earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments held during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments were initially purchased in September 2016.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded no interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe recorded $0.1 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other expense of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,192\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $4.1 million was the result of an increase of $2.2 million in revenue recognized from our now-terminated collaboration with Biogen and an increase of $1.9 million in revenue recognized from our collaboration with Astellas.\nUnder our Biogen collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.2 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue from Biogen was the result of the termination of the collaboration agreement which resulted in the recognition of $3.1 million in previously deferred revenue. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in payments received from Biogen in 2016.\nUnder our Astellas collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue from the Astellas collaboration was the result of $1.8 million in payments received pursuant to the fourth and fifth amendments of the agreement. Payments received under the agreement are recognized as revenue over the research term, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including stock-based\ncompensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,392\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $11.5 million was primarily due to an increase of $12.0 million in costs incurred in advancing the preclinical development and clinical trials of our CF program, of which $5.6 million related to activities supporting our Phase 1 clinical trials of PTI-428 which commenced during the first quarter of 2016. The overall increase in research and development expenses was also due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $2.1 million resulting from an average increase in the headcount of research and development employees from year to year, including an increase of $0.5 million in employee stock-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in costs incurred on our Usp14 program due to the termination of the Biogen agreement and focusing our resources on the clinical development of PTI-428.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $5.6 million in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million in professional fees and an increase of $2.0 million in personnel-related costs. The $2.4 million increase in professional fees is primarily associated with costs incurred as the result of becoming a public company in 2016, including costs related to investor relations and legal and audit costs associated with our SEC filings. Personnel-related costs increased by $2.0 million largely as the result of a net increase in average headcount from year to year, including an increase of $0.8 million in employee stock-based compensation expense and an increase of $0.4 million in non-employee stock-based compensation expense.\nInterest Income\nWe recorded $0.2 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to no interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to interest earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments held during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded no interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $0.6 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to interest accrued on principal amount of our convertible promissory notes issued during 2015 and 2014, prior to the conversion of all of our outstanding convertible promissory notes and accrued interest thereon into shares of Series B preferred stock in September 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe recorded an immaterial amount of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to other income of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $0.1 in other expense was due to the decrease in the fair value of our derivative liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from our collaboration agreements and research grant. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, which are in various phases of preclinical development and clinical trials, and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds received from our initial public offering and subsequent follow-on offering, the sale of preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements and a research grant.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $74.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $216.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a loss of $59.4 million and used $52.4 million of cash in operations. We expect that our cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements, based upon our current operating plan, into early 2019. In accordance with the requirements of ASC 205-40, we have determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months of the issuance date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nAlthough we have been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. As such, under the requirements of ASC 205-40, management may not consider the potential for future capital raises or management plans to reduce costs that are not considered probable in its assessment of our ability to meet our obligations for the next twelve months. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which would adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (52,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,925\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67,028\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (263\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, operating activities used $52.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $59.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.0 million and $3.0 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our net loss was primarily attributed to an increase of $19.7 million in research and development activities associated with the advancement of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of $2.7 million in prepaids and other current assets due to increased upfront payments made to clinical and other research organizations, along with other vendors, and an increase of $0.7 million in accounts receivable. Additionally, there was an increase of $1.5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2017 which is largely the result of increased spending on research and development programs. These increases were an offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in deferred revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities used $41.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $37.2 million and $6.9 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to an increase of $11.5 million in research and development activities associated with the advancement of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and an increase of $5.6 million in general and administrative expenses. These increases were offset by an increase of $4.1 million of revenue recognized during the period. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of a decrease of $5.4 million in deferred revenue, which is largely attributable to the termination of the Biogen agreement in 2016. Due to increased upfront payments made to clinical and other research organizations, along with other vendors, there was an increase of $3.9 million in prepaids and other current assets. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.4 million in accrued expenses in 2016 which is largely the result of increased spending on research and development programs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, operating activities used $19.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $25.0 million, partially offset by cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.3 million and non-cash charges of $1.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses, as we had limited collaboration and research grant revenue for the year. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $2.7 million increase in deferred revenue related to our collaboration\nagreements, a $0.5 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase in accrued expenses, a $0.2 million decrease in other assets and a $0.1 million decrease in other current assets. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to increased spending on our research and development programs as well as the timing of vendor invoicing and payments and the decrease in accounts receivable was due to the timing of payments received under our collaboration agreements.\nInvesting Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by investing activities totaled $20.2 million, consisting of proceeds received from maturities of our short-term investments, partially offset by additional purchases of short-term investments in the year ended of 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $67.0 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of our purchases of short-term investments in the year ended 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $0.3 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $43.3 million, primarily resulting from proceeds net of commissions and underwriting discounts of $43.2 million from the sale of common stock in connection with the follow-on public offering and $0.1 million proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments of less than $0.1 million of public offering costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $113.7 million, primarily resulting from proceeds net of commissions and underwriting discounts of $116.8 million from the sale of common stock in connection with the initial and follow-on public offerings, partially offset by payments of $3.3 million of public offering costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $24.7 million, primarily resulting from net proceeds of $21.1 million from the sale of Series B preferred stock and proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, partially offset by payments of $1.5 million of initial public offering costs.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates in development. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nOur expenses will also increase as we:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, including PTI-428 and PTI-801, as well as our combination therapies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek support and approval from our collaboration partners, the TDN and other interested parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> develop and expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support our ongoing preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we initiate additional clinical trials, expand our existing clinical trials and launch commercialization efforts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements.

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaborations agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an innovative, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics to treat cystic fibrosis, or CF, and other diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company focuses on identifying therapies that restore protein function. CF is a disease caused by defects in the function or abundance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. Our CF focused pipeline consists of novel CFTR modulators including correctors, potentiators and amplifiers. Upon discovery of amplifiers, a novel class of CFTR modulators, we have exploited its novel mechanism of action as a drug screening tool and have subsequently identified correctors and potentiators to be developed as part of combination therapies. Investigational agents representative of all three classes of CFTR modulators are currently in clinical development and include PTI-428, an amplifier, and PTI-801 a third generation corrector, both of which we believe are amenable for add-on therapy to standard-of-care CFTR modulator treatment and PTI-808, a potentiator intended to be developed as part of a dual combination with PTI-801 and a triple combination that also includes PTI-428 and PTI-801. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize our own therapies, including add-on and combination therapies for CF patients who have at least onedel mutation, representing the majority of the patient population.\nThere is presently no cure for CF. CF affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide with the vast majority of the diagnosed patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is a progressive disease and the most common fatal inherited disease among Caucasians. Without normal CFTR protein activity, thick mucus accumulates in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and causes many complications, including respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, and frequent hospitalizations. In 2016, the median age of death in the United States from CF was 30 years.\nThe approval of CFTR modulator based therapy, consisting of a potentiator and a combination of a potentiator and a corrector, has validated the clinical benefit of a small molecule pharmacological approach to improve CFTR function and has become a standard of care for eligible CF patients. These developments have spurred drug discovery and development initiatives that include a combinational approach of multiple modulators. To our knowledge there are only two pharmaceutical companies currently developing combined uses of three CFTR modulators whose goal is the restoration of CFTR protein activity in CF patients by using one potentiator and two corrector molecules. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or tezacaftor, are believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve a higher level of activity without repairing the actual protein mutation. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane.\nUnlike other triple combination drug discovery and development approaches for CF that are based on potentiators and correctors, our program includes PTI-428, an amplifier, a novel CFTR modulator with unique and distinguished molecular properties. PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking, function and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized unfolded form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Using industry-standard in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that co-administration of PTI-428 with correctors and potentiators significantly improves the in vitro CFTR protein activity achieved by these CFTR modulators alone.\nDue to the unique ability of amplifiers to selectively increase the amount of the unfolded form of CFTR protein and its synergistic mechanism of action with certain other types of CFTR modulators, we believe that PTI-428 could become the anchor therapeutic agent for combination therapies comprising multiple classes of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF. A triple combination regimen that includes PTI-428 with PTI-801, a corrector, and PTI-808, a potentiator, has been shown to restore in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal, in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells homozygous fordel.\nWith the recent advent of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care, which addresses only the symptoms of CF, to disease-modifying agents that target the genetic cause of the disease or the mutated CFTR protein. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize a proprietary combination therapy for patients with andel mutation of the CFTR gene, the most common CFTR gene mutation. In the United States, approximately 86% of all CF patients have andel mutation of the CFTR gene, of which approximately 53% are homozygous (having two copies of thedel mutation), and approximately 47% are heterozygous (having andel mutation and one other mutation).\nWe and others have analyzed published data by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, on its CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and the correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) and combinations thereof, which show a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity and lung function improvement. We have shown in vitro that PTI-428 increases the amount of available CFTR protein and, when combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles the CFTR protein activity in the cell compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor. In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial in CF patients and healthy volunteers in the first half of 2016. The Phase 1 trial in CF patients included single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. We reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker data from SAD and MAD cohorts in the PTI-428 Phase 1 clinical trial in CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) as their background, standard of care therapy, as well as a cohort of CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days who were not taking CFTR modulator based therapies.\nWe have completed a 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial for PTI-428 in CF patients randomized to receive either PTI-428 or placebo for 28 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae as their background, standard of care therapy to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg of once-a-day PTI-428. In December of 2017, we announced the results of the study which showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi\u00ae demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p\u22640.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p\u22640.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing.\nIn CF subjects on Orkambi\u00ae therapy, it has been shown in two registrational Phase 3 studies that the magnitude of response to Orkambi varied according to patient lung function at screening suggesting that the overall efficacy captured in these studies was mainly driven by the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 below 70% (+3.3 percentage points) while the changes in the group with FEV1 \u226570% were not statistically significant. A similar analysis was performed in our 28-day study with PTI-428 and it showed an average +6.6 percentage points (p<0.05) increase in absolute ppFEV1 compared to placebo for patients who had lower baseline ppFEV1 value (<70%). The results of the subgroup analysis are consistent with Phase 3 data with Orkambi\u00ae, suggesting that PTI-428 potentially amplifies the Orkambi\u00ae effect in the responder population.\nAdditional endpoints in the study included measurement of changes in sweat chloride (secondary endpoint) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelia (exploratory endpoint). In this study, a positive increase in CFTR protein from baseline was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in an in vitro human bronchial cell (HBE) cell model. In contrast, changes in sweat chloride did not correlate with changes in lung function.\nIn the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and there were two adverse events, or AEs, that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi\u00ae only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously.\nIn March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for thedel mutation who are receiving Orkambi\u00ae as background therapy. The designation was based on the FDA's review of available clinical evidence, including the observed increase in FEV1 and CFTR protein levels in the 28-day study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. The FDA grants orphan designation to promote the development of product candidates for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients annually. This designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of certain administrative filing fees.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-801, a corrector molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017 and is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017.\nWe have initiated a 14-day once-a-day dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi\u00ae therapy. In December of 2017, we reported initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and one placebo) of the first dose level tested. All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor. There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related. Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. This study, designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, is ongoing.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 and is now active. PTI-808 has completed investigation in 48 healthy volunteers with up to 300 mg in single and multiple dose cohorts. PTI-808 was found to be generally well tolerated. One subject experienced a serious adverse event from a pre-existing condition of transverse myelitis. This serious adverse event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. All other adverse events that have been reported to date were of mild or moderate severity. Preliminary PK assessment of PTI-808 suggests that it could potentially be suitable for once daily dosing.\nCo-administration of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 has been completed in 20 healthy volunteer subjects. Safety and PK profiles achieved with seven days of once-a-day oral dosing of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 indicated these compounds were generally well-tolerated and could potentially be amenable for once a day dosing. No SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. The PK data demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.\nCombination study protocols for trials in CF patients have been reviewed by key patient advocacy and regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. In January of 2018, we announced that our triple combination clinical study protocol received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.\nIn 2018, we aim to (1) produce additional data from our 14-day study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi in the first half, (2) continue dosing CF patients in a double combination trial consisting of\nPTI-801 and PTI-808, and produce initial data by mid-year, (3) initiate a triple combination of our proprietary agents PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in the first half, and produce preliminary data in the second half and (4) initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in patients on background Symdeko in the second half with initial data in early 2019.\nWe have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, as well as our proprietary combinations. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for add-on therapies based on PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in regions where ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and ivacaftor and tezacaftor, as applicable) are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in those regions. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement.\nIn addition to our wholly owned CF programs, we have partnered with a major pharmaceutical company, Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, on our unfolded protein response, or UPR, program. The UPR program is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. In August 2016, we announced the achievement of a preclinical milestone by demonstrating that selective modulation of the UPR pathway is an effective disease-modifying approach in the treatment of multiple diseases with few or no therapies currently available.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, proceeds from our initial public offering in February 2016, proceeds from our follow-on public offerings in September 2016 and December 2017, and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements and a research grant.\nOn February 10, 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $42.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on February 11, 2016, all outstanding shares of the Company's convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 9,699,600 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,590,742 common shares were issued for payment of $36.0 million of accruing dividends due to the holders of Series A preferred stock.\nIn September 2016, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $13.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $69.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.5 million and other offering expenses of $0.8 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nOn October 31, 2017, we determined to focus our resources on research and clinical development of our cystic fibrosis programs, as well as supporting our collaboration with Astellas. Accordingly, we reduced headcount dedicated to research from 46% of the total workforce to 34% through the elimination of 13 positions. As a result of this action, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, we estimated annualized savings of approximately $3.0 million, with one-time severance and related costs of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn December 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $42.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.3 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to\npurchase an additional 1,200,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $59.4 million and $37.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $216.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u2022 expand and/or advance our add-on and proprietary combination therapy candidates, PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, into Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \n \u2022 seek support and approval from our collaboration partners, the TDN and other interested parties; \n \u2022 hire personnel to support our product development, manufacturing, commercialization and administrative efforts; and \n \u2022 advance the research and development efforts of our CF and other product candidates, including, without limitation, back-up compounds. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs going forward associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of public or private equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements, based upon our current operating plan, into early 2019. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Primarily all of our revenue to date has been derived from our collaboration agreements with Astellas and Biogen (and the Biogen agreement is now terminated).\nUnder the Astellas collaboration agreement, entered into in November 2014, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million, $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize revenue from all upfront payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the three and a half-year research term, which commenced in January 2015, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Astellas collaboration agreement totaled $1.1 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn May 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment, effective as of January 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. In connection with such amendment, in June 2016 we received a payment of $1.0 million to conduct certain experiments during the period from February 1, 2016 through July 31, 2016. During this period, we did not receive any other payment or reimbursement under the agreement. The payment is being recognized over the research term of the agreement with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned. In July 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment effective as of July 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. as a result of achieving a pre-clinical milestone and are progressing to the optimization phase. The amendment provides for the Joint Research Committee to evaluate progress at various intervals throughout the optimization phase. In connection with the amendment, the Company received a $0.8 million non-substantive milestone payment which is being recognized, over the three and a half-year research term of the agreement, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term.\nUnder the Biogen collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.2 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not recognize revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the termination of the agreement effective December 6, 2016. Through this date, we recognized revenue from all upfront license payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the four-year research term, which commenced in December 2013, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement totaled $5.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Upon termination of the agreement, we recognized the remaining $3.1 million of deferred revenue. We do not have any deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and we will not recognize any additional revenue under this terminated agreement in the future.\nWe expect that any future revenue recognized under the Astellas collaboration agreement will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the uncertain timing of future milestone payments and the uncertain quantity of our research services provided from quarter to quarter. Further, subject to the terms and conditions of our collaboration agreements, our collaborators have certain unilateral rights to discontinue their participation in the research activities and, as a result, future payments to us under the agreements. Additionally, we expect our revenue recognition in the statement of operations and our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet to change upon the adoption of new revenue accounting guidance, ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of 2018, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which include costs of research services incurred in connection with our collaboration agreements and research grant, consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, central laboratories, contractors and CROs in connection with our preclinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our platform technology and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources to manage our preclinical development activities and perform data analysis for such activities. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\n\nWe expect that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing clinical trials and other preclinical development activities. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs for completing the clinical development of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, or any of our combination therapies, for the treatment of CF or the cost associated with the development of any of our other product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies; \n \u2022 successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u2022 the cooperation and approval we receive from third parties including clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, the TDN and CTN; \n \u2022 the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u2022 obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; \n \u2022 launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and \n \u2022 maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables, or others identified within this filing, with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or\nother testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, patent, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs and director expenses, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Prior to 2016, our interest income was not significant due to nominal cash balances and low interest earned on the cash balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on $15.0 million in convertible promissory notes we issued during 2015, all of which notes and accrued interest were converted into Series B preferred stock in September 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair values of our preferred stock warrant liability, our derivative liability and amortization/accretion on our short-term investments. We previously issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A preferred stock that we believe is a financial instrument that may require a transfer of assets because of the redemption features of the underlying stock. Therefore, we had classified this warrant as a liability that we had remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we had recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our initial public offering in February 2016, the underlying convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrant became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The derivative liability relates to a cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement, which meets the definition of a derivative. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) tax reform legislation. The legislation resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% down to a flat rate of 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit.\nAs a result of the enacted tax law, the Company has revalued the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate. The revaluation resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $24.0 million with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance and therefore no net effect on the 2017 tax provision affecting the Company's statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $196.9 million and $182.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $6.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2026, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria.\nDeferred revenue not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is reported as non-current deferred revenue.\nWe will adopt new revenue accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which we expect to impact this policy, the amount and timing of our future revenue recognition, and the amount of revenue previously recognized in our published financial statements. For further discussion, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaborative Research and License Agreements\nThe terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The arrangement consideration from these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, reimbursement of certain third-party costs, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue\nwill be recognized. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.\nThe consideration received under the arrangement that is fixed or determinable is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight- line basis over the period we are expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, with a cumulative catch-up being for the elapsed portion of the research term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of\nservice performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met. However, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock option awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option- pricing model.\nWe do not recognize compensation expense for awards with performance-based vesting conditions granted to consultants and non-employees for which satisfaction of the performance conditions is not solely within the control of the holder until the performance conditions have been met.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our February 11, 2016 initial public offering, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Accordingly, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and non-employees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the\nU.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nValuation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nWe have issued a freestanding warrant exercisable for shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock. These warrants were classified as a liability in the accompanying balance sheets prior to the completion of our IPO in February 2016, as the terms for liquidation of the underlying security were outside our control. The warrant was recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with any changes in fair value being recognized in other income (expense), net in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We ceased the remeasurement of the fair value of the convertible warrant liability upon the conversion of the warrant to a common stock warrant, which occurred upon the completion of our IPO on February 11, 2016. Subsequent to such conversion, the warrant is classified as a component of stockholders' equity and is no longer subject to remeasurement. These warrants were exercised in 2017 and none are outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of Derivative Liability\nWe identified an embedded derivative resulting from the cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement. Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying host instrument are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis, which incorporates assumptions and estimates to value the derivative instrument. We assess these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value of our common stock, expected term of the derivative instrument, expected volatility of the common stock price, risk-free interest rate, expected sales-based milestone payments, discount rate, probability of a change of control event, and the probability that the counterparty would elect to accept the alternative cash payment in lieu of its right to the future sales-based milestone payments. We determine the per share fair value of the underlying stock price by taking into consideration recent factors we deem relevant. We estimate the expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a one-year term. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a one-year term. We estimate the expected sales-based milestone payments based on four times the maximum research funding allowable under the CFFT collaboration agreement plus the expected achievement of certain milestones. We estimate the discount rate in the calculation of the present value of the expected future milestone payments based on expected returns of alternative investments of a similar type. We estimate the probability of a change of control event by taking into consideration recent developments.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company\u201d, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and\ncomparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering in February 2016 or until we no longer meet the other requirements for being an emerging growth company,\u201d whichever occurs first.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nRevenue was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.1 million was the result of a decrease of $5.2 million in revenue recognized from our now-terminated collaboration with Biogen and an increase of $2.1 million in revenue recognized from our collaboration with Astellas.\nUnder our Biogen collaboration agreement, we did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.2 million revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenue from Biogen was the result of the termination of the collaboration agreement which resulted in the recognition of all previously deferred revenue in December 2016.\nUnder our Astellas collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue from the Astellas collaboration was the result of additional reimbursement revenue earned in 2017. Payments received under the agreement are recognized as revenue over the research term, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nResearch and development expenses were $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $19.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in costs incurred in advancing the clinical trials of our CF program, as PTI-428 advanced into Phase 2 clinical trials, PTI-801 and PTI-808 initiated Phase 1 clinical trials, and we initiated combination trials. The overall increase in research and development expenses was also due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $4.4 million resulting from an average increase in the headcount of research and development employees from year to year, including an increase of $0.7 million in employee stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were essentially flat compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income\nWe recorded $0.6 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $0.4 million was due to interest earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments held during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments were initially purchased in September 2016.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded no interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe recorded $0.1 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other expense of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nRevenue was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $4.1 million was the result of an increase of $2.2 million in revenue recognized from our now-terminated collaboration with", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are an innovative, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics to treat cystic fibrosis, or CF, and other diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company focuses on identifying therapies that restore protein function. CF is a disease caused by defects in the function or abundance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. Our CF focused pipeline consists of novel CFTR modulators including correctors, potentiators and amplifiers. Upon discovery of amplifiers, a novel class of CFTR modulators, we have exploited its novel mechanism of action as a drug screening tool and have subsequently identified correctors and potentiators to be developed as part of combination therapies. Investigational agents representative of all three classes of CFTR modulators are currently in clinical development and include PTI-428, an amplifier, and PTI-801 a third generation corrector, both of which we believe are amenable for add-on therapy to standard-of-care CFTR modulator treatment and PTI-808, a potentiator intended to be developed as part of a dual combination with PTI-801 and a triple combination that also includes PTI-428 and PTI-801. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize our own therapies, including add-on and combination therapies for CF patients who have at least onedel mutation, representing the majority of the patient population.\nThere is presently no cure for CF. CF affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide with the vast majority of the diagnosed patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is a progressive disease and the most common fatal inherited disease among Caucasians. Without normal CFTR protein activity, thick mucus accumulates in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and causes many complications, including respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, and frequent hospitalizations. In 2016, the median age of death in the United States from CF was 30 years.\nThe approval of CFTR modulator based therapy, consisting of a potentiator and a combination of a potentiator and a corrector, has validated the clinical benefit of a small molecule pharmacological approach to improve CFTR function and has become a standard of care for eligible CF patients. These developments have spurred drug discovery and development initiatives that include a combinational approach of multiple modulators. To our knowledge there are only two pharmaceutical companies currently developing combined uses of three CFTR modulators whose goal is the restoration of CFTR protein activity in CF patients by using one potentiator and two corrector molecules. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or tezacaftor, are believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve a higher level of activity without repairing the actual protein mutation. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane.\nUnlike other triple combination drug discovery and development approaches for CF that are based on potentiators and correctors, our program includes PTI-428, an amplifier, a novel CFTR modulator with unique and distinguished molecular properties. PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking, function and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized unfolded form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Using industry-standard in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that co-administration of PTI-428 with correctors and potentiators significantly improves the in vitro CFTR protein activity achieved by these CFTR modulators alone.\nDue to the unique ability of amplifiers to selectively increase the amount of the unfolded form of CFTR protein and its synergistic mechanism of action with certain other types of CFTR modulators, we believe that PTI-428 could become the anchor therapeutic agent for combination therapies comprising multiple classes of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF. A triple combination regimen that includes PTI-428 with PTI-801, a corrector, and PTI-808, a potentiator, has been shown to restore in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal, in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells homozygous fordel.\nWith the recent advent of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care, which addresses only the symptoms of CF, to disease-modifying agents that target the genetic cause of the disease or the mutated CFTR protein. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize a proprietary combination therapy for patients with andel mutation of the CFTR gene, the most common CFTR gene mutation. In the United States, approximately 86% of all CF patients have andel mutation of the CFTR gene, of which approximately 53% are homozygous (having two copies of thedel mutation), and approximately 47% are heterozygous (having andel mutation and one other mutation).\nWe and others have analyzed published data by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, on its CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and the correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) and combinations thereof, which show a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity and lung function improvement. We have shown in vitro that PTI-428 increases the amount of available CFTR protein and, when combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles the CFTR protein activity in the cell compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor. In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial in CF patients and healthy volunteers in the first half of 2016. The Phase 1 trial in CF patients included single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. We reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker data from SAD and MAD cohorts in the PTI-428 Phase 1 clinical trial in CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) as their background, standard of care therapy, as well as a cohort of CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days who were not taking CFTR modulator based therapies.\nWe have completed a 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial for PTI-428 in CF patients randomized to receive either PTI-428 or placebo for 28 days in addition to Orkambi\u00ae as their background, standard of care therapy to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg of once-a-day PTI-428. In December of 2017, we announced the results of the study which showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi\u00ae demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p\u22640.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p\u22640.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing.\nIn CF subjects on Orkambi\u00ae therapy, it has been shown in two registrational Phase 3 studies that the magnitude of response to Orkambi varied according to patient lung function at screening suggesting that the overall efficacy captured in these studies was mainly driven by the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 below 70% (+3.3 percentage points) while the changes in the group with FEV1 \u226570% were not statistically significant. A similar analysis was performed in our 28-day study with PTI-428 and it showed an average +6.6 percentage points (p<0.05) increase in absolute ppFEV1 compared to placebo for patients who had lower baseline ppFEV1 value (<70%). The results of the subgroup analysis are consistent with Phase 3 data with Orkambi\u00ae, suggesting that PTI-428 potentially amplifies the Orkambi\u00ae effect in the responder population.\nAdditional endpoints in the study included measurement of changes in sweat chloride (secondary endpoint) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelia (exploratory endpoint). In this study, a positive increase in CFTR protein from baseline was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in an in vitro human bronchial cell (HBE) cell model. In contrast, changes in sweat chloride did not correlate with changes in lung function.\nIn the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and there were two adverse events, or AEs, that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi\u00ae only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously.\nIn March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for thedel mutation who are receiving Orkambi\u00ae as background therapy. The designation was based on the FDA's review of available clinical evidence, including the observed increase in FEV1 and CFTR protein levels in the 28-day study. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. The FDA grants orphan designation to promote the development of product candidates for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients annually. This designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of certain administrative filing fees.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-801, a corrector molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017 and is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017.\nWe have initiated a 14-day once-a-day dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi\u00ae therapy. In December of 2017, we reported initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and one placebo) of the first dose level tested. All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor. There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related. Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. This study, designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, is ongoing.\nOur IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 and is now active. PTI-808 has completed investigation in 48 healthy volunteers with up to 300 mg in single and multiple dose cohorts. PTI-808 was found to be generally well tolerated. One subject experienced a serious adverse event from a pre-existing condition of transverse myelitis. This serious adverse event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. All other adverse events that have been reported to date were of mild or moderate severity. Preliminary PK assessment of PTI-808 suggests that it could potentially be suitable for once daily dosing.\nCo-administration of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 has been completed in 20 healthy volunteer subjects. Safety and PK profiles achieved with seven days of once-a-day oral dosing of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 indicated these compounds were generally well-tolerated and could potentially be amenable for once a day dosing. No SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. The PK data demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.\nCombination study protocols for trials in CF patients have been reviewed by key patient advocacy and regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. In January of 2018, we announced that our triple combination clinical study protocol received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.\nIn 2018, we aim to (1) produce additional data from our 14-day study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi in the first half, (2) continue dosing CF patients in a double combination trial consisting of\nPTI-801 and PTI-808, and produce initial data by mid-year, (3) initiate a triple combination of our proprietary agents PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in the first half, and produce preliminary data in the second half and (4) initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in patients on background Symdeko in the second half with initial data in early 2019.\nWe have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, as well as our proprietary combinations. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for add-on therapies based on PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in regions where ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and ivacaftor and tezacaftor, as applicable) are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in those regions. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement.\nIn addition to our wholly owned CF programs, we have partnered with a major pharmaceutical company, Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, on our unfolded protein response, or UPR, program. The UPR program is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. In August 2016, we announced the achievement of a preclinical milestone by demonstrating that selective modulation of the UPR pathway is an effective disease-modifying approach in the treatment of multiple diseases with few or no therapies currently available.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, proceeds from our initial public offering in February 2016, proceeds from our follow-on public offerings in September 2016 and December 2017, and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements and a research grant.\nOn February 10, 2016, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $42.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upon the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, on February 11, 2016, all outstanding shares of the Company's convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 9,699,600 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,590,742 common shares were issued for payment of $36.0 million of accruing dividends due to the holders of Series A preferred stock.\nIn September 2016, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $13.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $69.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4.5 million and other offering expenses of $0.8 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nOn October 31, 2017, we determined to focus our resources on research and clinical development of our cystic fibrosis programs, as well as supporting our collaboration with Astellas. Accordingly, we reduced headcount dedicated to research from 46% of the total workforce to 34% through the elimination of 13 positions. As a result of this action, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, we estimated annualized savings of approximately $3.0 million, with one-time severance and related costs of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn December 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock and issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $42.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.8 million and other offering expenses of $0.3 million. The foregoing includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to\npurchase an additional 1,200,000 shares of our common stock within 30 days following the date of the final prospectus for the offering.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $59.4 million and $37.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $216.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u2022 expand and/or advance our add-on and proprietary combination therapy candidates, PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, into Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; \n \u2022 seek support and approval from our collaboration partners, the TDN and other interested parties; \n \u2022 hire personnel to support our product development, manufacturing, commercialization and administrative efforts; and \n \u2022 advance the research and development efforts of our CF and other product candidates, including, without limitation, back-up compounds. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs going forward associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of public or private equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nWe expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements, based upon our current operating plan, into early 2019. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Primarily all of our revenue to date has been derived from our collaboration agreements with Astellas and Biogen (and the Biogen agreement is now terminated).\nUnder the Astellas collaboration agreement, entered into in November 2014, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million, $3.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize revenue from all upfront payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the three and a half-year research term, which commenced in January 2015, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Astellas collaboration agreement totaled $1.1 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn May 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment, effective as of January 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. In connection with such amendment, in June 2016 we received a payment of $1.0 million to conduct certain experiments during the period from February 1, 2016 through July 31, 2016. During this period, we did not receive any other payment or reimbursement under the agreement. The payment is being recognized over the research term of the agreement with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned. In July 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment effective as of July 31, 2016, to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Astellas Pharma, Inc. as a result of achieving a pre-clinical milestone and are progressing to the optimization phase. The amendment provides for the Joint Research Committee to evaluate progress at various intervals throughout the optimization phase. In connection with the amendment, the Company received a $0.8 million non-substantive milestone payment which is being recognized, over the three and a half-year research term of the agreement, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term.\nUnder the Biogen collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.2 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not recognize revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the termination of the agreement effective December 6, 2016. Through this date, we recognized revenue from all upfront license payments, research funding payments, non-substantive milestone payments and reimbursements of third-party costs under this arrangement, together as a single unit, over the four-year research term, which commenced in December 2013, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research services being recognized at the time any non-substantive milestone payment or other consideration is earned. Amounts recorded as deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement totaled $5.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Upon termination of the agreement, we recognized the remaining $3.1 million of deferred revenue. We do not have any deferred revenue under the Biogen collaboration agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and we will not recognize any additional revenue under this terminated agreement in the future.\nWe expect that any future revenue recognized under the Astellas collaboration agreement will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the uncertain timing of future milestone payments and the uncertain quantity of our research services provided from quarter to quarter. Further, subject to the terms and conditions of our collaboration agreements, our collaborators have certain unilateral rights to discontinue their participation in the research activities and, as a result, future payments to us under the agreements. Additionally, we expect our revenue recognition in the statement of operations and our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet to change upon the adoption of new revenue accounting guidance, ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of 2018, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses, which include costs of research services incurred in connection with our collaboration agreements and research grant, consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, central laboratories, contractors and CROs in connection with our preclinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our platform technology and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources to manage our preclinical development activities and perform data analysis for such activities. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.\nThe table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing clinical trials and other preclinical development activities. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs for completing the clinical development of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, or any of our combination therapies, for the treatment of CF or the cost associated with the development of any of our other product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies; \n \u2022 successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u2022 the cooperation and approval we receive from third parties including clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, the TDN and CTN; \n \u2022 the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u2022 obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; \n \u2022 launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and \n \u2022 maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables, or others identified within this filing, with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or\nother testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, patent, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs and director expenses, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Prior to 2016, our interest income was not significant due to nominal cash balances and low interest earned on the cash balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on $15.0 million in convertible promissory notes we issued during 2015, all of which notes and accrued interest were converted into Series B preferred stock in September 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair values of our preferred stock warrant liability, our derivative liability and amortization/accretion on our short-term investments. We previously issued a warrant for the purchase of our Series A preferred stock that we believe is a financial instrument that may require a transfer of assets because of the redemption features of the underlying stock. Therefore, we had classified this warrant as a liability that we had remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, and we had recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our initial public offering in February 2016, the underlying convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock warrant became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The derivative liability relates to a cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement, which meets the definition of a derivative. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d) tax reform legislation. The legislation resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% down to a flat rate of 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination, reduction or limitation of certain domestic deductions and credits, limitation of the deduction for NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of NOL carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits, including the orphan drug tax credit.\nAs a result of the enacted tax law, the Company has revalued the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate. The revaluation resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $24.0 million with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance and therefore no net effect on the 2017 tax provision affecting the Company's statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $196.9 million and $182.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $6.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2026, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria.\nDeferred revenue not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is reported as non-current deferred revenue.\nWe will adopt new revenue accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which we expect to impact this policy, the amount and timing of our future revenue recognition, and the amount of revenue previously recognized in our published financial statements. For further discussion, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCollaborative Research and License Agreements\nThe terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The arrangement consideration from these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, reimbursement of certain third-party costs, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.\nWe evaluate multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue\nwill be recognized. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.\nThe consideration received under the arrangement that is fixed or determinable is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight- line basis over the period we are expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1) the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, with a cumulative catch-up being for the elapsed portion of the research term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of\nservice performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met. However, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock option awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option- pricing model.\nWe do not recognize compensation expense for awards with performance-based vesting conditions granted to consultants and non-employees for which satisfaction of the performance conditions is not solely within the control of the holder until the performance conditions have been met.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to our February 11, 2016 initial public offering, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Accordingly, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla\u201d options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and non-employees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the\nU.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nValuation of Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nWe have issued a freestanding warrant exercisable for shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock. These warrants were classified as a liability in the accompanying balance sheets prior to the completion of our IPO in February 2016, as the terms for liquidation of the underlying security were outside our control. The warrant was recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with any changes in fair value being recognized in other income (expense), net in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We ceased the remeasurement of the fair value of the convertible warrant liability upon the conversion of the warrant to a common stock warrant, which occurred upon the completion of our IPO on February 11, 2016. Subsequent to such conversion, the warrant is classified as a component of stockholders' equity and is no longer subject to remeasurement. These warrants were exercised in 2017 and none are outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of Derivative Liability\nWe identified an embedded derivative resulting from the cash settlement option associated with the change of control provision in our CFFT collaboration agreement. Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying host instrument are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. Therefore, we have classified this derivative as a liability that we remeasure to fair value at each reporting period, and we record the changes in the derivative liability as a component of other income (expense), net.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis, which incorporates assumptions and estimates to value the derivative instrument. We assess these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value of our common stock, expected term of the derivative instrument, expected volatility of the common stock price, risk-free interest rate, expected sales-based milestone payments, discount rate, probability of a change of control event, and the probability that the counterparty would elect to accept the alternative cash payment in lieu of its right to the future sales-based milestone payments. We determine the per share fair value of the underlying stock price by taking into consideration recent factors we deem relevant. We estimate the expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a one-year term. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a one-year term. We estimate the expected sales-based milestone payments based on four times the maximum research funding allowable under the CFFT collaboration agreement plus the expected achievement of certain milestones. We estimate the discount rate in the calculation of the present value of the expected future milestone payments based on expected returns of alternative investments of a similar type. We estimate the probability of a change of control event by taking into consideration recent developments.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company\u201d, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and\ncomparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering in February 2016 or until we no longer meet the other requirements for being an emerging growth company,\u201d whichever occurs first.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (220\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59,973\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (59,432\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.1 million was the result of a decrease of $5.2 million in revenue recognized from our now-terminated collaboration with Biogen and an increase of $2.1 million in revenue recognized from our collaboration with Astellas.\nUnder our Biogen collaboration agreement, we did not recognize any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.2 million revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenue from Biogen was the result of the termination of the collaboration agreement which resulted in the recognition of all previously deferred revenue in December 2016.\nUnder our Astellas collaboration agreement, we recognized revenue of $5.3 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue from the Astellas collaboration was the result of additional reimbursement revenue earned in 2017. Payments received under the agreement are recognized as revenue over the research term, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including stock-based\ncompensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $19.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $12.1 million in costs incurred in advancing the clinical trials of our CF program, as PTI-428 advanced into Phase 2 clinical trials, PTI-801 and PTI-808 initiated Phase 1 clinical trials, and we initiated combination trials. The overall increase in research and development expenses was also due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $4.4 million resulting from an average increase in the headcount of research and development employees from year to year, including an increase of $0.7 million in employee stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were essentially flat compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income\nWe recorded $0.6 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $0.4 million was due to interest earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments held during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our short-term investments were initially purchased in September 2016.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded no interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe recorded $0.1 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other expense of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,921\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (599\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,040\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,192\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
