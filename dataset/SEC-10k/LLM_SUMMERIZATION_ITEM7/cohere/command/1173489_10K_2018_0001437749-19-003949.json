This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth under Risk Factors,\u201d as well as those otherwise discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report. See Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data.\u201d\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, both appearing elsewhere in this annual report.\nHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, CEVA is the leading licensor of signal processing platforms and a primary player in artificial intelligence (AI) processors for a smarter, connected world. We partner with semiconductor companies and OEMs worldwide to create power-efficient, intelligent and connected devices for a range of end markets, including mobile, consumer, automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT).\nOur ultra-low-power hardware and software IPs address many of the most complex technologies for imaging and computer vision, neural networks, sound and long- and short-range wireless. Our portfolio includes comprehensive platforms for 5G baseband processing in handsets and base station RAN, highly integrated cellular IoT solutions, DSP platforms incorporating voice input algorithms and software for voice-enabled devices, DSP platforms for advanced imaging and computer vision in any camera-enabled device, and a family of self-contained AI processors that address a wide range of edge applications. For short-range wireless, we offer the industry's most widely adopted IPs for Bluetooth (low energy and dual mode) and Wi-Fi (4/5/6 up to 4x4).\nOur technologies are licensed to leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) companies throughout the world. These companies incorporate our IP into application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs\u201d) and application-specific standard products ( ASSPs\u201d) that they manufacture, market and sell to wireless, consumer, automotive and IoT companies. We believe that our licensing business is progressing well with strong interest, diverse customer base and a myriad of target markets. Our state-of-the-art technology has shipped in more than 10 billion chips to date for a wide range of diverse end markets. Every second, thirty devices sold worldwide are powered by CEVA.\nWe believe the adoption of our signal processing platforms and AI processors beyond our traditional cellular baseband market continues to progress. As a testament to this trend, during the fourth quarter and full year 2018, we concluded 13 and 48 licensing deals, respectively, all of which are for non-cellular baseband applications. Moreover, based on shipment data or our best estimates of the shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2018, shipments of CEVA-powered non-cellular baseband products reached an all-time quarterly record of 114 million units. This data is indicative of the continued traction our non-baseband customers are gaining with our signal processing IPs.\nWe believe the following key elements represent significant growth drivers for the company:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> CEVA is firmly established in the largest space in the semiconductor industry - baseband for mobile handsets. In particular, in LTE smartphone markets, we continue to maintain a strong presence. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, our customers shipped approximately 154 million LTE units. The growth over the same period in 2017 and over the first and second quarters of 2018 were primarily driven by the wide adoption of our advanced DSPs at the world's most successful smartphone OEM in its new flagship models.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The royalty we derive from high-end smartphones is higher on average than that of mid- and low-tier smartphones due to more DSP content in high end premier smartphones that bear a higher royalty average selling price ( ASP\u201d). As a result, in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we benefitted from an ASP uplift in LTE-based modems due to the wide adoption of our technology in a series of high end flagship smartphones that launched. Looking ahead, our advanced DSPs and 5G platform for mobile broadband put us in a strong position to power 5G modems for handsets, fixed wireless and other UE use cases. Incorporating a range of DSPs and processors, including an AI processor dedicated to improving 5G processing efficiency, we believe our CEVA-PentaG is the most advanced cellular baseband IP in the industry today.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our specialization and competitive edge in signal processing platforms for 5G base stations, handsets and NB-IoT put us in a strong position to capitalize on the emergence of 5G to address mass market adoption and benefit from new 5G usage models such as fixed wireless access, remote radio heads, cellular backhaul, small cells, and other machine type communications such as connected cars, smart cities and industrial markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our broad Bluetooth and Wi-Fi IPs allow us to expand further into IoT applications and substantially increase our overall addressable market.

Our addressable market size for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is expected to be more than 8.8 billion devices annually by 2022.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The growing market potential for voice assisted devices, as voice is becoming a primary user interface for IoT applications, including mobile, automotive and consumer devices, offers an additional growth segment for the company in voice-enabled devices such as smartphones, headsets, earbuds, smart speakers, smart home and automotive. To better address this market, we recently introduced our WhisPro speech recognition technology and our ClearVox voice input software that are offered in conjunction with our audio/voice DSPs. These highly-integrated platforms, plus our proven track record in audio/voice processing with more than 6 billion audio chips shipped to date, put us in a strong position to power audio and voice roadmaps across this new range of addressable end markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our CEVA-XM4 and CEVA-XM6 imaging and vision platforms and deep learning capabilities provide highly compelling offerings for any camera-enabled device such as smartphones, tablets, automotive safety (ADAS), autonomous driving (AD), drones, robotics, security and surveillance, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), drones, and signage. Per research from Yole D\u00e9veloppement, camera-enabled devices incorporating computer vision and AI are expected to exceed 1 billion units by 2022. We have already signed more than fifty licensing agreements for our imaging and vision DSPs across those markets, where our customers can add camera-related enhancements such as smarter autofocus, better picture using super resolution algorithms, and better image capture in low-light environments. Other customers can add video analytics support to enable new services like augmented reality, gesture recognition and advanced safety capabilities in cars. This transformation in vision processing and neural net software are opportunities for us to expand our footprint and content in smartphones, drones, consumer cameras, surveillance, automotive ADAS and industrial IoT applications.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Beyond vision, neural networks are increasingly being deployed for a wide range of markets in order to make devices smarter.\u201d These markets include IoT, smartphones, surveillance, automotive, robotics, medical and industrial. To address this significant and lucrative opportunity, we introduced NeuPro\u2122 - a family of AI processors for deep learning at the edge. These self-contained AI processors bring the power of deep learning to the device, without relying on connectivity to the cloud. We believe this market opportunity for AI at the edge is on top of our existing product lines and represents new licensing and royalty drivers for the company in the coming years. During 2018, we signed three leading customers for our NeuPro AI processors targeting the ADAS, surveillance, and consumer camera markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of our diversification strategy beyond baseband for handsets and our progress in addressing those new markets under the IoT umbrella, we expect significant growth in royalty revenues derived from non-handset baseband applications over the next few years due to a combination of higher unit shipments of Bluetooth and other connectivity products that bear lower ASPs, along with higher ASPs driven by base station and vision products.\nAt our first investor and analyst day held on January 14, 2019 in New York City, we presented our anticipated financial metrics for year 2022. We forecasted that our licensing revenue in 2022 will have grown approximately 10% to 20% from current levels, our royalty revenue will be approximately two times the current levels and our net income will be approximately three times the current levels.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> equity-based compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> impairment of marketable securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period. Material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management's estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions. Management's judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically.\nEffective as of January 1, 2018, we have followed the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The guidance provides a unified model to determine how revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nThe following is a description of principal activities from which we generate revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> identification of the contract with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> determination of the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, as detailed below, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nWe generate our revenues from (1) licensing intellectual property, which in certain circumstances is modified for customer-specific requirements, (2) royalty revenues and (3) other revenues, which include revenues from support, training and sale of development systems. We license our IP to semiconductor companies throughout the world. These semiconductor companies then manufacture, market and sell custom-designed chipsets to OEMs of a variety of consumer electronics products. We also license our technology directly to OEMs, which are considered end users.\nWe account for our license and related revenue in accordance with ASC 606. A license may be perpetual or time limited in its application. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from IP licenses at the time of delivery when the customer accepts control of the IP, as the IP is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that our IP license is distinct as a customer can benefit from the software on its own.\nMost of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Stand-alone selling prices of IP licenses are typically estimated using the residual approach. Stand-alone selling prices of services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nWhen contracts involve a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provide the customer with a significant benefit of financing, unless the financing period is under one year and only after the products or services were provided, which is a practical expediency permitted under ASC 606.\nRevenues from contracts that involve significant customization of our IP to customer-specific specifications are performance obligations we generally account for as performance obligations satisfied over time. Our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have an enforceable right to payment. We recognize revenue on such contracts using cost based input methods, which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on a ratio between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for the contract. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined, in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract.\nRevenues that are derived from the sale of a licensee's products that incorporate our IP are classified as royalty revenues. Royalty revenues are recognized during the quarter in which the sale of the product incorporating our IP occurs. Royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenues received by our licensees on sales of products incorporating our IP or on a per unit basis, as specified in the agreements with the licensees. We receive the actual sales data from our customers after the quarter ends and accounts for it as unbilled receivables. When we do not receive actual sales data from the customer prior to the finalization of its financial statements, royalty revenues are recognized based on our estimation of the customer's sales during the quarter. We may engage a third party to perform royalty audits of our licensees, and if these audits indicate any over- or under-reported royalties, we account for the results when the audits are resolved.\nIn addition to license fees, contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide for post contract support and training, which consists of telephone or e-mail support, correction of errors (bug fixing) and unspecified updates and upgrades. Fees for post contract support, which takes place after delivery to the customer, are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year. After the mandatory period, the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis. We consider the post contract support performance obligation as a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time, and as such, we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight-line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee, typically 12 months. Training services are considered performance obligations satisfied over-time, and as such, revenues from training services are recognized as the training is performed.\nRevenues from the sale of development systems are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers .\nWe capitalize sales commission as costs of obtaining a contract when they are incremental and, if they are expected to be recovered, amortized consistently with the pattern of transfer of the good or service to which the asset relates. If the expected amortization period is one year or less, the commission fee is expensed when incurred.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and other\u201d. There is a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for potential impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. In such a case, the second phase is then performed, and the reporting unit measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. For each of the three years for the period ended December 31, 2018, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes mainly in Israel, France, the U.S. and Ireland. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We recognize income taxes under the liability method. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income.\nAccounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry forwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 are appropriately accounted for, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding income taxes. We have filed or are in the process of filing local and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by the tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. We believe that we adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to tax audits and settlement. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statute of limitations on potential assessments expire.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as a number of foreign jurisdictions. In December 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform. The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. A year after enactment, some aspects of U.S. tax reform still remain unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance has been issued (by the Internal Revenue Services, and the U.S. Treasury Department), there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time. Also, a number of U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We adjusted our net operating losses to account for the additional transition tax expense of $3.5 million added to the provisional amounts of $2 million recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act, for a total transition tax expense of $5.5 million. As a result of utilizing our net operating losses, no tax expense was ultimately paid. We elected to account for GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Legislation and clarifying guidance are expected to continue to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and various states in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC No. 718, Stock Compensation\u201d which requires the recognition of compensation expenses based on estimated fair values for all equity-based awards made to employees and non-employee directors.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2017, at which time it changed our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. There was no material impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements. In addition, historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets and were classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of adoption during the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards as part of our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income during the reporting periods during which equity vesting occurs. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are presented as an operating activity in the statements of cash flows rather than financing activity. We elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits prospectively in accordance with ASU 2016-09 and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nWe estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation right ( SAR\u201d) awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of income. We recognize compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. Prior to January 1, 2017, we recognized compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures were based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures and the rate was adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any.\nWe recognize compensation expenses for the value of our restricted stock unit ( RSU\u201d) awards, based on the straight-line method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. The fair value of each RSU is the market value as determined by the closing price of the common stock on the day of grant.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation model for options and SARs granted. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected option and SAR term. We have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term. The Monte-Carlo model also considers the suboptimal exercise multiple which is based on the average exercise behavior of our employees over the past years, the contractual term of the options and SARs, and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder of the options and SARs in computing the value of the options and SARs. Although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity-based compensation expense are reasonable, actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.\nImpairment of Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist mainly of corporate bonds. We determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. In accordance with FASB ASC No. 320, Investment Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d we classify marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in financial income, net. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity, both of which, together with interest, are included in financial income, net. We have classified all marketable securities as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date, because it is probable that we will sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives.\nWe recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments in debt securities below the cost basis of such securities is judged to be other-than-temporary. The determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different from our estimates. Factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations and the potential recovery period . For securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, the amount of impairment is recognized in the statement of income and is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, no other-than temporary impairment were recorded related to our marketable securities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Leases\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will replace the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases.\u201d The updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements - Leases (Topic 842).\" This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, the prior comparative period's financials will remain the same as those previously presented. We have elected to apply the guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption and not restate comparative periods and elected the available practical expedients on adoption.\nWe currently estimate recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.5 million on our consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact on our statement of income.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Other accounting standards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which requires that expected credit losses relating to financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. ASU 2016-13 limits the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and also requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. The new standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt this standard and the potential effect of such adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the income tax effects of tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the qualitative impairment test is necessary. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments in this update should be adopted for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents line items from our consolidated

derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers. Sales to Spreadtrum represented 15%, 23% and 27% of our total revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Generally, the identity of our other customers representing 10% or more of our total revenues varies from period to period, especially with respect to our licensing customers as we generate licensing revenues generally from new customers on a quarterly basis. With respect to our royalty revenues, three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2018, and collectively represented 76% of our total royalty revenues for 2018. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2017, and collectively represented 70% of our total royalty revenues for 2017. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2016, and collectively represented 80% of our total royalty revenues for 2016. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customers is explainable in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry. The loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our near-term future operating results.\nThe following table sets forth the products and services as percentages of our total revenues in each of the periods set forth below:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DSP products (DSP cores and platforms):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baseband for handset and other devices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-baseband (audio, imaging and vision)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity products (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and SATA/SAS)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues for 2019 from the above products and services.\nLicensing and related revenue\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing and related revenue (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicensing and related revenues in 2017 and 2018 surpassed the $40 million level for the first time in CEVA's history. Historically, CEVA recorded levels of $20 million or $30 million per year. This new elevated level of licensing and related revenue is a direct outcome of our diversification strategy that was put in place in 2014, concurrently with the acquisition of RivieraWaves. The decrease in licensing and related revenues from 2017 to 2018 principally reflected a decrease in vision and base station related licensing deals, partially offset by higher revenues from licensing of connectivity IPs of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi related products. The increase in licensing and related revenues from 2016 to 2017 principally reflected strong demand throughout the year for our products, in particular vision, deep neural networks, 5G base stations, backhaul and cellular IoT, offset by lower handset baseband licensing deals.\nOur higher licensing and related revenue in recent years reflect organic growth and investments in our research and development efforts that have strengthened our successful diversification strategy to develop and license products outside our traditional handset baseband markets. A steady growth in licensees in diversified markets is the key driver for new royalty streams, in addition to incremental revenues from our existing royalty sources. At our investor and analyst day in January 2019, we disclosed that we have 40 royalty paying customers today and additionally, 60 customers are actively designing new chips incorporating our technologies, which we expect to gradually roll out for production over the coming years. We believe that this customer base will approximately double our annual royalty revenue in 2022. Our licensing business made solid progress in 2018, with 49 license agreements signed, including 16 first-time customers. These customers are targeting a range of large and diversified markets, including 5G, cellular IoT, AI, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. With more than 140 signed in the previous three years, we form the foundation necessary for significant market share expansion and royalty revenue growth in the coming years.\nLicensing and related revenue accounted for 51.9% of our total revenues for 2018, compared with 49.0% and 43.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRoyalty Revenues\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenues (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate royalty revenues from our customers who ship units of chips incorporating our technologies. Until the end of 2017, our royalties were invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606. Under the new standard, our royalty revenues represent what our customers shipped during any quarter in 2018, or our best estimates for such shipments. The royalty rate is based either on a certain percent of the chipset price or a fixed amount per chipset based on volume discounts.\nBased on internal data and Strategy Analytics' provisional worldwide shipment data, CEVA's worldwide market share of handset baseband chips that incorporate our technologies represented approximately 24%, 36% and 35% of the worldwide baseband volume in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and accounted for approximately 77%, 82% and 91% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur 2018 royalty business was impacted by headwinds in the handset market and the slower than originally anticipated expansion at our base station customers. Nevertheless, we continued to strengthen our footprint in our non-baseband markets, with shipments of more than 370 million devices, up 41% year over year. In particular, in the fast-growing Bluetooth space, we shipped more than 300 million devices in 2018. The increase in royalty revenues from 2016 to 2017 reflects higher non-handset baseband licensing revenues in recent years that contributed to higher-non handset baseband royalties in 2017, mainly from a new base station royalty payer, Bluetooth market expansion and vision based products, slightly offset by lower handset baseband royalties due to softness at low tier smartphone shipments.\nAs we enter 2019, we expect the elevated inventories in handsets to add to the usual seasonal weakness in our near-term royalties. With that said, we do expect continued expansion at our non-handset and base station customers, along with a recovery in handsets in the latter part of 2019. All in all, we are very excited by the market adoption of our leading-edge technologies in key growth areas, and believe we are on track to more than double our royalty revenue business in 2022.\nThe five largest royalty-paying customers accounted for 86% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, compared to 88% of our total royalty revenues for 2017 and 92% of our total royalty revenues for 2016.\nOur customers reported sales of 929 million chipsets incorporating our technologies in 2018, compared to 1,156 million in 2017 and 1,076 million in 2016. The decrease in units shipped in 2018 as compared to 2017 was attributable to a significant decrease in handset market volume shipments, partially offset by an increase in Bluetooth shipments. The increase in units shipped in 2017 as compared to 2016 was also attributable to a significant increase in Bluetooth shipments and first time ramp up volumes from our vision customers.\nGeographic Revenue Analysis\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East (EME) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific (APAC) (1) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) China\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) S.

The decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the United States from 2016 to 2017 reflected lower licensing and royalty revenues mainly due to less design starts and licensing activities, and a continued design-out of two of our handset baseband customers.\nThe increase in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the EME region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected higher royalty revenues due to a share gain at a large U.S. handset OEM coupled by higher ASP for LTE shipments, offset by lower licensing revenues. The slight increase in revenues in absolute dollars and the decrease in percentage in the EME region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected lower licensing revenues for base station applications offset by higher royalty revenues, mainly from handset baseband products.\nThe decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the APAC region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected significantly lower handset baseband royalties following a challenging year for the entire cellular industry, in particular in the first half of 2018. The increase in revenues in absolute dollars in the APAC region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected higher licensing activities associated with many of our newer non-handset baseband customers and technologies for base stations and vision, as well as higher royalties, mainly from a first time base station customer that ramped up production in 2017.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenues accounted for 10.2% of our total revenues for 2018, compared to 7.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 8.4% of our total revenues for 2016. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, and the amortization of intangible assets. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, higher third party IP costs (associated with the NB-IoT product line), higher payments to the Israeli Innovation Authority of the Ministry of Economy and Industry in Israel (the IIA\u201d) and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower customization work for our licensees.\nCost of revenues includes labor-related costs and, where applicable, costs related to overhead, subcontractors, materials, travel, royalty expenses payments to the IIA, amortization of acquired intangible assets (NB-IoT technologies) and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in cost of revenues for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $588,000, $459,000 and $246,000, respectively. Royalty expenses relate to royalties payable to the IIA that amount to 3%-3.5% of the actual sales of certain of our products, the development of which previously included grants from the IIA. The obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual sales of these products. Amortization of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies in the first quarter of 2018. Our amortization charges were $0.3 million for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the net amount of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies was $1.9 million.\nWe anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in 2019 as compared to prior years, partially due to higher expenses of approximately $1.7 million for engineering customization related expenses that will be allocated from our research and developments costs to cost of revenue on a 5G related license deal that was concluded in 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administration\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total operating expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and employee related costs, mainly due to higher headcount, and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses.

The net increase in research and development expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, mainly due to higher headcount associated with accelerated strategic research and development programs and collaborations with our customers to expedite their production ramp-ups, lower research grants received from the IIA and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses associated with our employee retention efforts. The average number of research and development personnel in 2018 was 238, compared to 217 in 2017 and 194 in 2016. The number of research and development personnel was 254 at December 31, 2018 as compared to 228 in 2017 and 199 in 2016.\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses cost will continue to increase in 2019. With our newly announced products and continued momentum with our existing licensing business, we will continue to innovate and reinforce our leadership, but with disciplined investments in research and developments costs. The increase will be approximately $4 million, mainly associated with investments in headcount, employee-related costs and EDA tools.\nResearch and development expenses, net of related government grants and French research tax benefits applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Imp\u00f4t Recherche ( CIR\u201d), were 61.3% of our total revenues for 2018, as compared with 46.2% for 2017 and 42.4% for 2016. We recorded research grants under funding programs of $3,352,000 in 2018, compared with $4,137,000 in 2017 and $6,410,000 in 2016. We recorded CIR benefits of $2,065,000, $1,555,000 and $1,485,000 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs, facilities expenses associated with research and development activities, project-related expenses connected with the development of our intellectual property which are expensed as incurred, and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in research and development expenses, net for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $5,141,000, $3,839,000 and $2,860,000, respectively. Research and development expenses are net of related government research grants and research tax benefits applicable to CIR. We view research and development as a principal strategic investment and have continued our commitment to invest heavily in this area, which represents the largest of our ongoing operating expenses. We will need to continue to invest in research and development and such expenses may increase in the future to keep pace with new trends in our industry.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expenses (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected lower salary and employee related costs. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 15.6% for 2018, as compared with 14.4% for 2017 and 15.9% for 2016. The total number of sales and marketing personnel was 32 in 2018, as compared with 36 in 2017 and 35 in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, travel and other costs associated with sales and marketing activities, as well as advertising, trade show participation, public relations and other marketing costs and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in sales and marketing expenses for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1,587,000, $1,428,000 and $922,000, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe slight decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected lower professional service fees, partially offset by higher salary and related employee costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher professional service fees and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 13.3% for 2018, as compared with 12.0% for 2017 and 11.8% for 2016. The total number of general and administrative personnel was 32 in 2018, as compared with 26 in 2017 and 23 in 2016. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of fees for directors, salaries for management and administrative employees, accounting and legal fees, expenses related to investor relations and facilities expenses associated with general and administrative activities and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in general and administrative expenses for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $3,051,000, $2,967,000 and $2,208,000, respectively.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nOur amortization charges were $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The charges were incurred in connection with the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of RivieraWaves in July 2014. As of December 31, 2018, the net amount of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of RivieraWaves was $0.8 million.\nFinancial Income, net\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> of which:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.02 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.24 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial income, net, consists of interest earned on investments, gains and losses from sale of marketable securities, accretion (amortization) of discount (premium) on marketable securities and foreign exchange movements.\nThe increase in interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities, net, for 2018 as compared to 2017 reflected higher yields. The increase in interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities, net, for 2017 as compared to 2016 reflected higher combined cash, bank deposits and marketable securities balances held and higher yields.\nWe review our monthly expected major non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non-U.S. dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations. This has resulted in a foreign exchange loss of $0.24 million, $0.02 million and $0.19 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRevaluation of investment in other company\nWe recorded a loss of $870 in 2018 related to revaluation of our investment in other company, in which we hold in cost.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded tax expenses of $0.7 million, $1.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The decrease in provision for income taxes in 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected lower income before taxes on income, partially offset by a tax benefit of $1.8 million in 2017 due to the release of a tax provision as a result of the completion of a tax audit in a certain foreign tax jurisdiction. The decrease in provision for income taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected a tax benefit of $1.8 million due to the release of a tax provision as a result of the completion of a tax audit in a certain foreign tax jurisdiction, partially offset by higher income before taxes on income and a one-time recording of a deferred tax asset due to a change in the estimation for taxable income for future years. We have significant operations in Israel and operations in France and the Republic of Ireland. A substantial portion of our taxable income is generated in Israel. Currently, our Israeli and Irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than U.S. tax rates.\nOur Irish subsidiary qualified for a 12.5% tax rate on its trade. Interest income generated by our Irish subsidiary is taxed at a rate of 25%.\nIn 2017, the French government passed a series of tax reforms allowing for a phased reduction in the corporate tax rate. In accordance with the tax reforms, our French subsidiary qualified in 2018 for a corporate tax rate of 28% for taxable profit up to \u20ac500,000 and the standard rate of 33.33% for taxable profit above \u20ac500,000. In 2019, the standard corporate income tax rate is reduced to 31%, with the first \u20ac500,000 of taxable profit still being subject to the reduced 28% rate. In 2020, a corporate income tax rate of 28% will become the new standard rate for all taxable profits. In 2021, the corporate income tax rate will be reduced to 26.5%. In 2022, the standard corporate income tax rate will be further reduced to 25%.\nOur Israeli subsidiary is entitled to various tax benefits by virtue of the Approved Enterprise\u201d and/or Benefited Enterprise\u201d status granted to its eight investment programs, as defined by the Israeli Investment Law. In accordance with the Investment Law, our Israeli subsidiary's first seven investment programs were subject to corporate tax rate of 23% in 2018, and our Israeli subsidiary's eighth investment programs was subject to corporate tax rate of 10% in 2018. However, our Israeli subsidiary is eligible for the erosion of tax basis with respect to its first seven investment programs, and this resulted in an increase in the taxable income attributable to the eighth investment program, which was subject to a reduced tax rate of 10% in 2018. The tax benefits under our Israeli subsidiary's active investment programs are scheduled to gradually expire starting in 2020.\nTo maintain our Israeli subsidiary's eligibility for the above tax benefits, it must continue to meet certain conditions under the Investment Law. Should our Israeli subsidiary fail to meet such conditions in the future, these benefits would be cancelled and it would be subject to corporate tax in Israel at the standard corporate rate and could be required to refund tax benefits already received, with interest and adjustments for inflation based on the Israeli consumer price index.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act provides for significant and wide-ranging changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Broadly, the implications most relevant to us include: a) a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, with various base erosion\u201d rules that may effectively limit the tax deductibility of certain payments made by our U.S. entities to our non-U.S. affiliates and additional limitations on deductions attributable to interest expense; and b) adopting elements of a territorial tax system. To transition into the territorial tax system, the Tax Act included a one-time tax on cumulative retained earnings of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries, at a rate of 15.5% for earnings represented by cash or cash equivalents, and 8.0% for the balance of such earnings. In connection with our completed analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, and after utilization of existing tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we did not incur a tax payment.\nIn January 2018, FASB released guidance on the accounting for taxes on the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either (i) accounting for deferred taxes relating to GILTI inclusions, or (ii) treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost, are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. We have elected to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense rather than provide U.S. deferred taxes on foreign temporary differences that are expected to generate GILTI income when they reverse in future years.\nFor more information about our provision for income taxes, see Note 13 to the attached Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $22.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $46.1 million in short term bank deposits, $77.5 million in marketable securities, and $21.9 million in long term bank deposits, totaling $167.8 million, as compared to $183.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected a repurchase of 655,876 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of approximately $20.0 million, offset by cash provided by operating activities.\nOut of total cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits and marketable securities of $167.8 million at year end 2018, $136.4 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to permanently reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign earnings to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. The determination of the amount of additional taxes related to the repatriation of these earnings is not practicable, as it may vary based on various factors such as the location of the cash and the effect of regulation in the various jurisdictions from which the cash would be repatriated.\nDuring 2018, we invested $41.3 million of cash in bank deposits and marketable securities with maturities up to 51 months from the balance sheet date. In addition, during the same period, bank deposits and marketable securities were sold or redeemed for cash amounting to $56.4 million. During 2017, we invested $101.9 million of cash in bank deposits and marketable securities with maturities up to 57 months from the balance sheet date. In addition, during the same period, bank deposits and marketable securities were sold or redeemed for cash amounting to $77.3 million. During 2016, we invested $85.0 million of cash in bank deposits and marketable securities with maturities up to 59 months from the balance sheet date. In addition, during the same period, bank deposits and marketable securities were sold or redeemed for cash amounting to $66.4 million. All of our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. The purchase and sale or redemption of available-for-sale marketable securities are considered part of investing cash flow. Available-for-sale marketable securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in the consolidated statements of income. We did not recognize any other-than-temporarily-impaired charges on marketable securities in 2018, 2017 and 2016. For more information about our marketable securities, see Notes 1 and 3 to the attached Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBank deposits are classified as short-term bank deposits and long-term bank deposits. Short-term bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than three months but no longer than one year from the balance sheet date, whereas long-term bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than one year as of the balance sheet date. Bank deposits are presented at their cost, including accrued interest, and purchases and sales are considered part of cash flows from investing activities.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $8.6 million and consisted of net income of $0.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $16.4 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $8.4 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $4.2 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $10.4 million of equity-based compensation expenses, $0.8 million of amortization of premiums on available-for-sale marketable securities and $0.9 million of revaluation of investment in other company in which we hold at cost. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase in trade receivables of $0.5 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.9 million (mainly as a result of an increase in French research tax credits which is generally refunded every three years), an increase in accrued interest on bank deposits of $0.6 million, an increase in deferred tax, net, of $2.2 million, a decrease in deferred revenues of $0.8 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other payables of $0.5 million, and a decrease in accrued payroll and related benefits of $0.5 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $24.5 million and consisted of net income of $17.0 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $13.1 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $3.3 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $8.7 million of equity-based compensation expenses and $1.2 million of amortization of premiums on available-for-sale marketable securities. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase in trade receivables of $1.4 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.5 million, an increase in deferred tax, net of $1.4 million, a decrease in deferred revenues of $1.9 million and a decrease in income tax payable of $1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other payables of $1.3 million and an increase in accrued payroll and related benefits of $1.8 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $14.5 million and consisted of net income of $13.1 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $10.0 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $8.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.6 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $6.2 million of equity-based compensation expenses and $1.1 million of amortization of premiums on available-for-sale marketable securities. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase in trade receivables of $11.0 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.6 million, and an increase in deferred tax, net, of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenues of $3.5 million and an increase in income tax payable of $0.7 million.\nCash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments. Our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll-related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses. Our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our accounts receivable, to some extent funding from the IIA and interest earned from our cash, deposits and marketable securities. The timing of receipts of accounts receivable from customers is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2018 was $9.8 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $28.8 million in 2017 and net cash used in investing activities of $21.0 million in 2016. We had a cash outflow of $19.7 million with respect to investments in marketable securities and a cash inflow of $23.5 million with respect to maturity, and sale, of marketable securities during 2018. Included in the cash inflow during 2018 was net proceeds of $11.3 million from bank deposits. We had a cash outflow of $54.9 million with respect to investments in marketable securities and a cash inflow of $32.8 million with respect to maturity, and sale, of marketable securities during 2017. Included in the cash outflow during 2017 was net investment of $2.6 million in bank deposits. We had a cash outflow of $43.5 million with respect to investments in marketable securities and a cash inflow of $28.8 million with respect to maturity and sale of marketable securities during 2016. Included in the cash outflow during 2016 was net investment of $3.9 million in bank deposits. Capital equipment purchases of computer hardware and software used in engineering development, furniture and fixtures amounted to approximately $3.3 million in 2018, $4.1 million in 2017 and $2.4 million in 2016. We had a cash outflow of $2.0 million in 2018 from the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $17.8 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $7.5 million in 2017 and net cash provided by financing activities of $6.2 million in 2016.\nIn August 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to one million shares of common stock which was further extended collectively by an additional five million shares in 2010, 2013 and 2014. In May 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 700,000 shares of common stock. In 2018, we repurchased 655,876 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $30.51 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million. In 2017, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. In 2016, we repurchased 180,013 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $18.98 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $3.4 million. As of December 31, 2018, 355,180 shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received $2.2 million, $7.5 million and $9.6 million, respectively, from the exercise of stock-based awards.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent, short-term bank deposits and marketable securities, along with cash from operations, will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate.\nIn addition, as part of our business strategy, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies and minority equity investments. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. See Risk Factors-We may seek to expand our business in ways that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses.\u201d for more detailed information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations - Leasehold properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations - design tools\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other purchase Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in Israel, Ireland, France, China, Japan and the United States. Purchase obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools. Other purchase obligations consist of capital and operating purchase order commitments. Other than set forth in the table above, we have no long-term debt or capital lease obligations.\nAt December 31, 2018, our income tax payable, net of withholding tax credits, included $2,739,000 related to uncertain tax positions. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2018, the amount of accrued severance pay was $9,632,000. Severance pay relates to accrued severance obligations to our Israeli employees as required under Israeli labor laws. These obligations are payable only upon termination, retirement or death of the respective employee. Of this amount, $606,000 is unfunded.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- The table is a summary of a dataset containing information about the

See Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data.\u201d\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, both appearing elsewhere in this annual report.\nHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, CEVA is the leading licensor of signal processing platforms and a primary player in artificial intelligence (AI) processors for a smarter, connected world. We partner with semiconductor companies and OEMs worldwide to create power-efficient, intelligent and connected devices for a range of end markets, including mobile, consumer, automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT).\nOur ultra-low-power hardware and software IPs address many of the most complex technologies for imaging and computer vision, neural networks, sound and long- and short-range wireless. Our portfolio includes comprehensive platforms for 5G baseband processing in handsets and base station RAN, highly integrated cellular IoT solutions, DSP platforms incorporating voice input algorithms and software for voice-enabled devices, DSP platforms for advanced imaging and computer vision in any camera-enabled device, and a family of self-contained AI processors that address a wide range of edge applications. For short-range wireless, we offer the industry's most widely adopted IPs for Bluetooth (low energy and dual mode) and Wi-Fi (4/5/6 up to 4x4).\nOur technologies are licensed to leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) companies throughout the world. These companies incorporate our IP into application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs\u201d) and application-specific standard products ( ASSPs\u201d) that they manufacture, market and sell to wireless, consumer, automotive and IoT companies. We believe that our licensing business is progressing well with strong interest, diverse customer base and a myriad of target markets. Our state-of-the-art technology has shipped in more than 10 billion chips to date for a wide range of diverse end markets. Every second, thirty devices sold worldwide are powered by CEVA.\nWe believe the adoption of our signal processing platforms and AI processors beyond our traditional cellular baseband market continues to progress. As a testament to this trend, during the fourth quarter and full year 2018, we concluded 13 and 48 licensing deals, respectively, all of which are for non-cellular baseband applications. Moreover, based on shipment data or our best estimates of the shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2018, shipments of CEVA-powered non-cellular baseband products reached an all-time quarterly record of 114 million units. This data is indicative of the continued traction our non-baseband customers are gaining with our signal processing IPs.\nWe believe the following key elements represent significant growth drivers for the company:\n \u25cf CEVA is firmly established in the largest space in the semiconductor industry - baseband for mobile handsets. In particular, in LTE smartphone markets, we continue to maintain a strong presence. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, our customers shipped approximately 154 million LTE units. The growth over the same period in 2017 and over the first and second quarters of 2018 were primarily driven by the wide adoption of our advanced DSPs at the world's most successful smartphone OEM in its new flagship models. \n \u25cf The royalty we derive from high-end smartphones is higher on average than that of mid- and low-tier smartphones due to more DSP content in high end premier smartphones that bear a higher royalty average selling price ( ASP\u201d). As a result, in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we benefitted from an ASP uplift in LTE-based modems due to the wide adoption of our technology in a series of high end flagship smartphones that launched. Looking ahead, our advanced DSPs and 5G platform for mobile broadband put us in a strong position to power 5G modems for handsets, fixed wireless and other UE use cases. Incorporating a range of DSPs and processors, including an AI processor dedicated to improving 5G processing efficiency, we believe our CEVA-PentaG is the most advanced cellular baseband IP in the industry today. \n \u25cf Our specialization and competitive edge in signal processing platforms for 5G base stations, handsets and NB-IoT put us in a strong position to capitalize on the emergence of 5G to address mass market adoption and benefit from new 5G usage models such as fixed wireless access, remote radio heads, cellular backhaul, small cells, and other machine type communications such as connected cars, smart cities and industrial markets. \n \u25cf Our broad Bluetooth and Wi-Fi IPs allow us to expand further into IoT applications and substantially increase our overall addressable market. In 2018, shipments of products incorporating our Bluetooth IP grew 50% year-over-year to reach 303 million devices. Our addressable market size for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is expected to be more than 8.8 billion devices annually by 2022. \n \u25cf The growing market potential for voice assisted devices, as voice is becoming a primary user interface for IoT applications, including mobile, automotive and consumer devices, offers an additional growth segment for the company in voice-enabled devices such as smartphones, headsets, earbuds, smart speakers, smart home and automotive. To better address this market, we recently introduced our WhisPro speech recognition technology and our ClearVox voice input software that are offered in conjunction with our audio/voice DSPs. These highly-integrated platforms, plus our proven track record in audio/voice processing with more than 6 billion audio chips shipped to date, put us in a strong position to power audio and voice roadmaps across this new range of addressable end markets. \n \u25cf Our CEVA-XM4 and CEVA-XM6 imaging and vision platforms and deep learning capabilities provide highly compelling offerings for any camera-enabled device such as smartphones, tablets, automotive safety (ADAS), autonomous driving (AD), drones, robotics, security and surveillance, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), drones, and signage. Per research from Yole D\u00e9veloppement, camera-enabled devices incorporating computer vision and AI are expected to exceed 1 billion units by 2022. We have already signed more than fifty licensing agreements for our imaging and vision DSPs across those markets, where our customers can add camera-related enhancements such as smarter autofocus, better picture using super resolution algorithms, and better image capture in low-light environments. Other customers can add video analytics support to enable new services like augmented reality, gesture recognition and advanced safety capabilities in cars. This transformation in vision processing and neural net software are opportunities for us to expand our footprint and content in smartphones, drones, consumer cameras, surveillance, automotive ADAS and industrial IoT applications. \n \u25cf Beyond vision, neural networks are increasingly being deployed for a wide range of markets in order to make devices smarter.\u201d These markets include IoT, smartphones, surveillance, automotive, robotics, medical and industrial. To address this significant and lucrative opportunity, we introduced NeuPro\u2122 - a family of AI processors for deep learning at the edge. These self-contained AI processors bring the power of deep learning to the device, without relying on connectivity to the cloud. We believe this market opportunity for AI at the edge is on top of our existing product lines and represents new licensing and royalty drivers for the company in the coming years. During 2018, we signed three leading customers for our NeuPro AI processors targeting the ADAS, surveillance, and consumer camera markets. \nAs a result of our diversification strategy beyond baseband for handsets and our progress in addressing those new markets under the IoT umbrella, we expect significant growth in royalty revenues derived from non-handset baseband applications over the next few years due to a combination of higher unit shipments of Bluetooth and other connectivity products that bear lower ASPs, along with higher ASPs driven by base station and vision products.\nAt our first investor and analyst day held on January 14, 2019 in New York City, we presented our anticipated financial metrics for year 2022. We forecasted that our licensing revenue in 2022 will have grown approximately 10% to 20% from current levels, our royalty revenue will be approximately two times the current levels and our net income will be approximately three times the current levels.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n \u25cf revenue recognition; \n \u25cf business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; \n \u25cf income taxes; \n \u25cf equity-based compensation; and \n \u25cf impairment of marketable securities; \nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period. Material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management's estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions. Management's judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically.\nEffective as of January 1, 2018, we have followed the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The guidance provides a unified model to determine how revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nThe following is a description of principal activities from which we generate revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n \u25cf identification of the contract with a customer; \n \u25cf identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u25cf determination of the transaction price; \n \u25cf allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u25cf recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, as detailed below, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nWe generate our revenues from (1) licensing intellectual property, which in certain circumstances is modified for customer-specific requirements, (2) royalty revenues and (3) other revenues, which include revenues from support, training and sale of development systems. We license our IP to semiconductor companies throughout the world. These semiconductor companies then manufacture, market and sell custom-designed chipsets to OEMs of a variety of consumer electronics products. We also license our technology directly to OEMs, which are considered end users.\nWe account for our license and related revenue in accordance with ASC 606. A license may be perpetual or time limited in its application. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from IP licenses at the time of delivery when the customer accepts control of the IP, as the IP is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that our IP license is distinct as a customer can benefit from the software on its own.\nMost of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Stand-alone selling prices of IP licenses are typically estimated using the residual approach. Stand-alone selling prices of services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nWhen contracts involve a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provide the customer with a significant benefit of financing, unless the financing period is under one year and only after the products or services were provided, which is a practical expediency permitted under ASC 606.\nRevenues from contracts that involve significant customization of our IP to customer-specific specifications are performance obligations we generally account for as performance obligations satisfied over time. Our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have an enforceable right to payment. We recognize revenue on such contracts using cost based input methods, which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on a ratio between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for the contract. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined, in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract.\nRevenues that are derived from the sale of a licensee's products that incorporate our IP are classified as royalty revenues. Royalty revenues are recognized during the quarter in which the sale of the product incorporating our IP occurs. Royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenues received by our licensees on sales of products incorporating our IP or on a per unit basis, as specified in the agreements with the licensees. We receive the actual sales data from our customers after the quarter ends and accounts for it as unbilled receivables. When we do not receive actual sales data from the customer prior to the finalization of its financial statements, royalty revenues are recognized based on our estimation of the customer's sales during the quarter. We may engage a third party to perform royalty audits of our licensees, and if these audits indicate any over- or under-reported royalties, we account for the results when the audits are resolved.\nIn addition to license fees, contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide for post contract support and training, which consists of telephone or e-mail support, correction of errors (bug fixing) and unspecified updates and upgrades. Fees for post contract support, which takes place after delivery to the customer, are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year. After the mandatory period, the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis. We consider the post contract support performance obligation as a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time, and as such, we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight-line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee, typically 12 months. Training services are considered performance obligations satisfied over-time, and as such, revenues from training services are recognized as the training is performed.\nRevenues from the sale of development systems are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers .\nWe capitalize sales commission as costs of obtaining a contract when they are incremental and, if they are expected to be recovered, amortized consistently with the pattern of transfer of the good or service to which the asset relates. If the expected amortization period is one year or less, the commission fee is expensed when incurred.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and other\u201d. There is a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for potential impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. In such a case, the second phase is then performed, and the reporting unit measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. For each of the three years for the period ended December 31, 2018, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes mainly in Israel, France, the U.S. and Ireland. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We recognize income taxes under the liability method. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income.\nAccounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry forwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 are appropriately accounted for, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding income taxes. We have filed or are in the process of filing local and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by the tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. We believe that we adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to tax audits and settlement. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statute of limitations on potential assessments expire.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as a number of foreign jurisdictions. In December 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform. The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. A year after enactment, some aspects of U.S. tax reform still remain unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance has been issued (by the Internal Revenue Services, and the U.S. Treasury Department), there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time. Also, a number of U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We adjusted our net operating losses to account for the additional transition tax expense of $3.5 million added to the provisional amounts of $2 million recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act, for a total transition tax expense of $5.5 million. As a result of utilizing our net operating losses, no tax expense was ultimately paid. We elected to account for GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Legislation and clarifying guidance are expected to continue to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and various states in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC No. 718, Stock Compensation\u201d which requires the recognition of compensation expenses based on estimated fair values for all equity-based awards made to employees and non-employee directors.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2017, at which time it changed our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. There was no material impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements. In addition, historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets and were classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of adoption during the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards as part of our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income during the reporting periods during which equity vesting occurs. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are presented as an operating activity in the statements of cash flows rather than financing activity. We elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits prospectively in accordance with ASU 2016-09 and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nWe estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation right ( SAR\u201d) awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of income. We recognize compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. Prior to January 1, 2017, we recognized compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures were based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures and the rate was adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any.\nWe recognize compensation expenses for the value of our restricted stock unit ( RSU\u201d) awards, based on the straight-line method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. The fair value of each RSU is the market value as determined by the closing price of the common stock on the day of grant.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation model for options and SARs granted. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected option and SAR term. We have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term. The Monte-Carlo model also considers the suboptimal exercise multiple which is based on the average exercise behavior of our employees over the past years, the contractual term of the options and SARs, and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder of the options and SARs in computing the value of the options and SARs. Although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity-based compensation expense are reasonable, actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.\nImpairment of Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist mainly of corporate bonds. We determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. In accordance with FASB ASC No. 320, Investment Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d we classify marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in financial income, net. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity, both of which, together with interest, are included in financial income, net. We have classified all marketable securities as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date, because it is probable that we will sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives.\nWe recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments in debt securities below the cost basis of such securities is judged to be other-than-temporary. The determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different from our estimates. Factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations and the potential recovery period . For securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, the amount of impairment is recognized in the statement of income and is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, no other-than temporary impairment were recorded related to our marketable securities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement\n (a) Leases \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will replace the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases.\u201d The updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements - Leases (Topic 842).\" This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, the prior comparative period's financials will remain the same as those previously presented. We have elected to apply the guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption and not restate comparative periods and elected the available practical expedients on adoption.\nWe currently estimate recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.5 million on our consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact on our statement of income.\n (b) Other accounting standards \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which requires that expected credit losses relating to financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. ASU 2016-13 limits the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and also requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. The new standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt this standard and the potential effect of such adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the income tax effects of tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the qualitative impairment test is necessary. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments in this update should be adopted for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents line items from our consolidated statements of income as percentages of our total revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nDiscussion and Analysis\nBelow we provide information on the significant line items in our consolidated statements of income for each of the past three fiscal years, including the percentage changes year-on-year, as well as an analysis of the principal drivers of change in these line items from year-to-year.\nRevenues\nTotal Revenues\n\nWe derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers. Sales to Spreadtrum represented 15%, 23% and 27% of our total revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Generally, the identity of our other customers representing 10% or more of our total revenues varies from period to period, especially with respect to our licensing customers as we generate licensing revenues generally from new customers on a quarterly basis. With respect to our royalty revenues, three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2018, and collectively represented 76% of our total royalty revenues for 2018. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2017, and collectively represented 70% of our total royalty revenues for 2017. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2016, and collectively represented 80% of our total royalty revenues for 2016. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customers is explainable in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry. The loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our near-term future operating results.\nThe following table sets forth the products and services as percentages of our total revenues in each of the periods set forth below:\n\nWe expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues for 2019 from the above products and services.\nLicensing and related revenue\n\nLicensing and related revenues in 2017 and 2018 surpassed the $40 million level for the first time in CEVA's history. Historically, CEVA recorded levels of $20 million or $30 million per year. This new elevated level of licensing and related revenue is a direct outcome of our diversification strategy that was put in place in 2014, concurrently with the acquisition of RivieraWaves. The decrease in licensing and related revenues from 2017 to 2018 principally reflected a decrease in vision and base station related licensing deals, partially offset by higher revenues from licensing of connectivity IPs of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi related products. The increase in licensing and related revenues from 2016 to 2017 principally reflected strong demand throughout the year for our products, in particular vision, deep neural networks, 5G base stations, backhaul and cellular IoT, offset by lower handset baseband licensing deals.\nOur higher licensing and related revenue in recent years reflect organic growth and investments in our research and development efforts that have strengthened our successful diversification strategy to develop and license products outside our traditional handset baseband markets. A steady growth in licensees in diversified markets is the key driver for new royalty streams, in addition to incremental revenues from our existing royalty sources. At our investor and analyst day in January 2019, we disclosed that we have 40 royalty paying customers today and additionally, 60 customers are actively designing new chips incorporating our technologies, which we expect to gradually roll out for production over the coming years. We believe that this customer base will approximately double our annual royalty revenue in 2022. Our licensing business made solid progress in 2018, with 49 license agreements signed, including 16 first-time customers. These customers are targeting a range of large and diversified markets, including 5G, cellular IoT, AI, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. With more than 140 signed in the previous three years, we form the foundation necessary for significant market share expansion and royalty revenue growth in the coming years.\nLicensing and related revenue accounted for 51.9% of our total revenues for 2018, compared with 49.0% and 43.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRoyalty Revenues\n\nWe generate royalty revenues from our customers who ship units of chips incorporating our technologies. Until the end of 2017, our royalties were invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606. Under the new standard, our royalty revenues represent what our customers shipped during any quarter in 2018, or our best estimates for such shipments. The royalty rate is based either on a certain percent of the chipset price or a fixed amount per chipset based on volume discounts.\nBased on internal data and Strategy Analytics' provisional worldwide shipment data, CEVA's worldwide market share of handset baseband chips that incorporate our technologies represented approximately 24%, 36% and 35% of the worldwide baseband volume in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and accounted for approximately 77%, 82% and 91% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur 2018 royalty business was impacted by headwinds in the handset market and the slower than originally anticipated expansion at our base station customers. Nevertheless, we continued to strengthen our footprint in our non-baseband markets, with shipments of more than 370 million devices, up 41% year over year. In particular, in the fast-growing Bluetooth space, we shipped more than 300 million devices in 2018. The increase in royalty revenues from 2016 to 2017 reflects higher non-handset baseband licensing revenues in recent years that contributed to higher-non handset baseband royalties in 2017, mainly from a new base station royalty payer, Bluetooth market expansion and vision based products, slightly offset by lower handset baseband royalties due to softness at low tier smartphone shipments.\nAs we enter 2019, we expect the elevated inventories in handsets to add to the usual seasonal weakness in our near-term royalties. With that said, we do expect continued expansion at our non-handset and base station customers, along with a recovery in handsets in the latter part of 2019. All in all, we are very excited by the market adoption of our leading-edge technologies in key growth areas, and believe we are on track to more than double our royalty revenue business in 2022.\nThe five largest royalty-paying customers accounted for 86% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, compared to 88% of our total royalty revenues for 2017 and 92% of our total royalty revenues for 2016.\nOur customers reported sales of 929 million chipsets incorporating our technologies in 2018, compared to 1,156 million in 2017 and 1,076 million in 2016. The decrease in units shipped in 2018 as compared to 2017 was attributable to a significant decrease in handset market volume shipments, partially offset by an increase in Bluetooth shipments. The increase in units shipped in 2017 as compared to 2016 was also attributable to a significant increase in Bluetooth shipments and first time ramp up volumes from our vision customers.\nGeographic Revenue Analysis\n\n*) Less than 10%\nDue to the nature of our license agreements and the associated potential large individual contract amounts, the geographic spilt of revenues both in absolute dollars and percentage terms generally varies from period to period.\nThe increase in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the United States from 2017 to 2018 reflected higher licensing and royalty revenues mainly due to more connectivity design starts, licensing activities and royalty contribution. The decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the United States from 2016 to 2017 reflected lower licensing and royalty revenues mainly due to less design starts and licensing activities, and a continued design-out of two of our handset baseband customers.\nThe increase in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the EME region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected higher royalty revenues due to a share gain at a large U.S. handset OEM coupled by higher ASP for LTE shipments, offset by lower licensing revenues. The slight increase in revenues in absolute dollars and the decrease in percentage in the EME region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected lower licensing revenues for base station applications offset by higher royalty revenues, mainly from handset baseband products.\nThe decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the APAC region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected significantly lower handset baseband royalties following a challenging year for the entire cellular industry, in particular in the first half of 2018. The increase in revenues in absolute dollars in the APAC region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected higher licensing activities associated with many of our newer non-handset baseband customers and technologies for base stations and vision, as well as higher royalties, mainly from a first time base station customer that ramped up production in 2017.\nCost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues accounted for 10.2% of our total revenues for 2018, compared to 7.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 8.4% of our total revenues for 2016. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, and the amortization of intangible assets. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, higher third party IP costs (associated with the NB-IoT product line), higher payments to the Israeli Innovation Authority of the Ministry of Economy and Industry in Israel (the IIA\u201d) and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower customization work for our licensees.\nCost of revenues includes labor-related costs and, where applicable, costs related to overhead, subcontractors, materials, travel, royalty expenses payments to the IIA, amortization of acquired intangible assets (NB-IoT technologies) and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in cost of revenues for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $588,000, $459,000 and $246,000, respectively. Royalty expenses relate to royalties payable to the IIA that amount to 3%-3.5% of the actual sales of certain of our products, the development of which previously included grants from the IIA. The obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual sales of these products. Amortization of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies in the first quarter of 2018. Our amortization charges were $0.3 million for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the net amount of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies was $1.9 million.\nWe anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in 2019 as compared to prior years, partially due to higher expenses of approximately $1.7 million for engineering customization related expenses that will be allocated from our research and developments costs to cost of revenue on a 5G related license deal that was concluded in 2018.\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe increase in total operating expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and employee related costs, mainly due to higher headcount, and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. The increase in total operating expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected lower research grants received from the IIA, higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses and higher salary and related costs, mainly due to higher headcount associated with accelerated strategic research and development programs and collaborations with our customers to expedite their production ramps.\nResearch and Development Expenses, Net\n\nThe net increase in research and development expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and employee related costs, mainly due to higher headcount, higher project-related expenses, lower research grants received from the IIA and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. The net increase in research and development expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, mainly due to higher headcount associated with accelerated strategic research and development programs and collaborations with our customers to expedite their production ramp-ups, lower research grants received from the IIA and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses associated with our employee retention efforts. The average number of research and development personnel in 2018 was 238, compared to 217 in 2017 and 194 in 2016. The number of research and development personnel was 254 at December 31, 2018 as compared to 228 in 2017 and 199 in 2016.\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses cost will continue to increase in 2019. With our newly announced products and continued momentum with our existing licensing business, we will continue to innovate and reinforce our leadership, but with disciplined investments in research and developments costs. The increase will be approximately $4 million, mainly associated with investments in headcount, employee-related costs and EDA tools.\nResearch and development expenses, net of related government grants and French research tax benefits applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Imp\u00f4t Recherche ( CIR\u201d), were 61.3% of our total revenues for 2018, as compared with 46.2% for 2017 and 42.4% for 2016. We recorded research grants under funding programs of $3,352,000 in 2018, compared with $4,137,000 in 2017 and $6,410,000 in 2016. We recorded CIR benefits of $2,065,000, $1,555,000 and $1,485,000 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs, facilities expenses associated with research and development activities, project-related expenses connected with the development of our intellectual property which are expensed as incurred, and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in research and development expenses, net for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $5,141,000, $3,839,000 and $2,860,000, respectively. Research and development expenses are net of related government research grants and research tax benefits applicable to CIR. We view research and development as a principal strategic investment and have continued our commitment to invest heavily in this area, which represents the largest of our ongoing operating expenses. We will need to continue to invest in research and development and such expenses may increase in the future to keep pace with new trends in our industry.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expenses (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report.

The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, both appearing elsewhere in this annual report.\nHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, CEVA is the leading licensor of signal processing platforms and a primary player in artificial intelligence (AI) processors for a smarter, connected world. We partner with semiconductor companies and OEMs worldwide to create power-efficient, intelligent and connected devices for a range of end markets, including mobile, consumer, automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT).\nOur ultra-low-power hardware and software IPs address many of the most complex technologies for imaging and computer vision, neural networks, sound and long- and short-range wireless. Our portfolio includes comprehensive platforms for 5G baseband processing in handsets and base station RAN, highly integrated cellular IoT solutions, DSP platforms incorporating voice input algorithms and software for voice-enabled devices, DSP platforms for advanced imaging and computer vision in any camera-enabled device, and a family of self-contained AI processors that address a wide range of edge applications. For short-range wireless, we offer the industry's most widely adopted IPs for Bluetooth (low energy and dual mode) and Wi-Fi (4/5/6 up to 4x4).\nOur technologies are licensed to leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) companies throughout the world. These companies incorporate our IP into application-specific integrated circuits ( ASICs\u201d) and application-specific standard products ( ASSPs\u201d) that they manufacture, market and sell to wireless, consumer, automotive and IoT companies. We believe that our licensing business is progressing well with strong interest, diverse customer base and a myriad of target markets. Our state-of-the-art technology has shipped in more than 10 billion chips to date for a wide range of diverse end markets. Every second, thirty devices sold worldwide are powered by CEVA.\nWe believe the adoption of our signal processing platforms and AI processors beyond our traditional cellular baseband market continues to progress. As a testament to this trend, during the fourth quarter and full year 2018, we concluded 13 and 48 licensing deals, respectively, all of which are for non-cellular baseband applications. Moreover, based on shipment data or our best estimates of the shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2018, shipments of CEVA-powered non-cellular baseband products reached an all-time quarterly record of 114 million units. This data is indicative of the continued traction our non-baseband customers are gaining with our signal processing IPs.\nWe believe the following key elements represent significant growth drivers for the company:\n \u25cf CEVA is firmly established in the largest space in the semiconductor industry - baseband for mobile handsets. In particular, in LTE smartphone markets, we continue to maintain a strong presence. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, our customers shipped approximately 154 million LTE units. The growth over the same period in 2017 and over the first and second quarters of 2018 were primarily driven by the wide adoption of our advanced DSPs at the world's most successful smartphone OEM in its new flagship models. \n \u25cf The royalty we derive from high-end smartphones is higher on average than that of mid- and low-tier smartphones due to more DSP content in high end premier smartphones that bear a higher royalty average selling price ( ASP\u201d). As a result, in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we benefitted from an ASP uplift in LTE-based modems due to the wide adoption of our technology in a series of high end flagship smartphones that launched. Looking ahead, our advanced DSPs and 5G platform for mobile broadband put us in a strong position to power 5G modems for handsets, fixed wireless and other UE use cases. Incorporating a range of DSPs and processors, including an AI processor dedicated to improving 5G processing efficiency, we believe our CEVA-PentaG is the most advanced cellular baseband IP in the industry today. \n \u25cf Our specialization and competitive edge in signal processing platforms for 5G base stations, handsets and NB-IoT put us in a strong position to capitalize on the emergence of 5G to address mass market adoption and benefit from new 5G usage models such as fixed wireless access, remote radio heads, cellular backhaul, small cells, and other machine type communications such as connected cars, smart cities and industrial markets. \n \u25cf Our broad Bluetooth and Wi-Fi IPs allow us to expand further into IoT applications and substantially increase our overall addressable market. In 2018, shipments of products incorporating our Bluetooth IP grew 50% year-over-year to reach 303 million devices. Our addressable market size for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is expected to be more than 8.8 billion devices annually by 2022. \n \u25cf The growing market potential for voice assisted devices, as voice is becoming a primary user interface for IoT applications, including mobile, automotive and consumer devices, offers an additional growth segment for the company in voice-enabled devices such as smartphones, headsets, earbuds, smart speakers, smart home and automotive. To better address this market, we recently introduced our WhisPro speech recognition technology and our ClearVox voice input software that are offered in conjunction with our audio/voice DSPs. These highly-integrated platforms, plus our proven track record in audio/voice processing with more than 6 billion audio chips shipped to date, put us in a strong position to power audio and voice roadmaps across this new range of addressable end markets. \n \u25cf Our CEVA-XM4 and CEVA-XM6 imaging and vision platforms and deep learning capabilities provide highly compelling offerings for any camera-enabled device such as smartphones, tablets, automotive safety (ADAS), autonomous driving (AD), drones, robotics, security and surveillance, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), drones, and signage. Per research from Yole D\u00e9veloppement, camera-enabled devices incorporating computer vision and AI are expected to exceed 1 billion units by 2022. We have already signed more than fifty licensing agreements for our imaging and vision DSPs across those markets, where our customers can add camera-related enhancements such as smarter autofocus, better picture using super resolution algorithms, and better image capture in low-light environments. Other customers can add video analytics support to enable new services like augmented reality, gesture recognition and advanced safety capabilities in cars. This transformation in vision processing and neural net software are opportunities for us to expand our footprint and content in smartphones, drones, consumer cameras, surveillance, automotive ADAS and industrial IoT applications. \n \u25cf Beyond vision, neural networks are increasingly being deployed for a wide range of markets in order to make devices smarter.\u201d These markets include IoT, smartphones, surveillance, automotive, robotics, medical and industrial. To address this significant and lucrative opportunity, we introduced NeuPro\u2122 - a family of AI processors for deep learning at the edge. These self-contained AI processors bring the power of deep learning to the device, without relying on connectivity to the cloud. We believe this market opportunity for AI at the edge is on top of our existing product lines and represents new licensing and royalty drivers for the company in the coming years. During 2018, we signed three leading customers for our NeuPro AI processors targeting the ADAS, surveillance, and consumer camera markets. \nAs a result of our diversification strategy beyond baseband for handsets and our progress in addressing those new markets under the IoT umbrella, we expect significant growth in royalty revenues derived from non-handset baseband applications over the next few years due to a combination of higher unit shipments of Bluetooth and other connectivity products that bear lower ASPs, along with higher ASPs driven by base station and vision products.\nAt our first investor and analyst day held on January 14, 2019 in New York City, we presented our anticipated financial metrics for year 2022. We forecasted that our licensing revenue in 2022 will have grown approximately 10% to 20% from current levels, our royalty revenue will be approximately two times the current levels and our net income will be approximately three times the current levels.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n \u25cf revenue recognition; \n \u25cf business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; \n \u25cf income taxes; \n \u25cf equity-based compensation; and \n \u25cf impairment of marketable securities; \nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period. Material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management's estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions. Management's judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically.\nEffective as of January 1, 2018, we have followed the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The guidance provides a unified model to determine how revenue is recognized. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nThe following is a description of principal activities from which we generate revenue. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n \u25cf identification of the contract with a customer; \n \u25cf identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u25cf determination of the transaction price; \n \u25cf allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u25cf recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, as detailed below, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nWe generate our revenues from (1) licensing intellectual property, which in certain circumstances is modified for customer-specific requirements, (2) royalty revenues and (3) other revenues, which include revenues from support, training and sale of development systems. We license our IP to semiconductor companies throughout the world. These semiconductor companies then manufacture, market and sell custom-designed chipsets to OEMs of a variety of consumer electronics products. We also license our technology directly to OEMs, which are considered end users.\nWe account for our license and related revenue in accordance with ASC 606. A license may be perpetual or time limited in its application. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue from IP licenses at the time of delivery when the customer accepts control of the IP, as the IP is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that our IP license is distinct as a customer can benefit from the software on its own.\nMost of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Stand-alone selling prices of IP licenses are typically estimated using the residual approach. Stand-alone selling prices of services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.\nWhen contracts involve a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provide the customer with a significant benefit of financing, unless the financing period is under one year and only after the products or services were provided, which is a practical expediency permitted under ASC 606.\nRevenues from contracts that involve significant customization of our IP to customer-specific specifications are performance obligations we generally account for as performance obligations satisfied over time. Our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have an enforceable right to payment. We recognize revenue on such contracts using cost based input methods, which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on a ratio between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for the contract. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined, in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract.\nRevenues that are derived from the sale of a licensee's products that incorporate our IP are classified as royalty revenues. Royalty revenues are recognized during the quarter in which the sale of the product incorporating our IP occurs. Royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenues received by our licensees on sales of products incorporating our IP or on a per unit basis, as specified in the agreements with the licensees. We receive the actual sales data from our customers after the quarter ends and accounts for it as unbilled receivables. When we do not receive actual sales data from the customer prior to the finalization of its financial statements, royalty revenues are recognized based on our estimation of the customer's sales during the quarter. We may engage a third party to perform royalty audits of our licensees, and if these audits indicate any over- or under-reported royalties, we account for the results when the audits are resolved.\nIn addition to license fees, contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide for post contract support and training, which consists of telephone or e-mail support, correction of errors (bug fixing) and unspecified updates and upgrades. Fees for post contract support, which takes place after delivery to the customer, are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year. After the mandatory period, the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis. We consider the post contract support performance obligation as a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time, and as such, we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight-line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee, typically 12 months. Training services are considered performance obligations satisfied over-time, and as such, revenues from training services are recognized as the training is performed.\nRevenues from the sale of development systems are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customers .\nWe capitalize sales commission as costs of obtaining a contract when they are incremental and, if they are expected to be recovered, amortized consistently with the pattern of transfer of the good or service to which the asset relates. If the expected amortization period is one year or less, the commission fee is expensed when incurred.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and other\u201d. There is a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for potential impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. In such a case, the second phase is then performed, and the reporting unit measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. For each of the three years for the period ended December 31, 2018, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes mainly in Israel, France, the U.S. and Ireland. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We recognize income taxes under the liability method. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To make this judgment, we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income.\nAccounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry forwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 are appropriately accounted for, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding income taxes. We have filed or are in the process of filing local and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by the tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. We believe that we adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to tax audits and settlement. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statute of limitations on potential assessments expire.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as a number of foreign jurisdictions. In December 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform. The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. A year after enactment, some aspects of U.S. tax reform still remain unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance has been issued (by the Internal Revenue Services, and the U.S. Treasury Department), there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time. Also, a number of U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We adjusted our net operating losses to account for the additional transition tax expense of $3.5 million added to the provisional amounts of $2 million recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act, for a total transition tax expense of $5.5 million. As a result of utilizing our net operating losses, no tax expense was ultimately paid. We elected to account for GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Legislation and clarifying guidance are expected to continue to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and various states in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC No. 718, Stock Compensation\u201d which requires the recognition of compensation expenses based on estimated fair values for all equity-based awards made to employees and non-employee directors.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2017, at which time it changed our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. There was no material impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements. In addition, historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets and were classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of adoption during the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from our equity awards as part of our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income during the reporting periods during which equity vesting occurs. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are presented as an operating activity in the statements of cash flows rather than financing activity. We elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits prospectively in accordance with ASU 2016-09 and prior periods have not been adjusted.\nWe estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation right ( SAR\u201d) awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of income. We recognize compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. Prior to January 1, 2017, we recognized compensation expenses for the value of our options and SARs, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures were based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures and the rate was adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any.\nWe recognize compensation expenses for the value of our restricted stock unit ( RSU\u201d) awards, based on the straight-line method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. The fair value of each RSU is the market value as determined by the closing price of the common stock on the day of grant.\nWe use the Monte-Carlo simulation model for options and SARs granted. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected option and SAR term. We have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term. The Monte-Carlo model also considers the suboptimal exercise multiple which is based on the average exercise behavior of our employees over the past years, the contractual term of the options and SARs, and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder of the options and SARs in computing the value of the options and SARs. Although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity-based compensation expense are reasonable, actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.\nImpairment of Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist mainly of corporate bonds. We determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. In accordance with FASB ASC No. 320, Investment Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d we classify marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in financial income, net. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity, both of which, together with interest, are included in financial income, net. We have classified all marketable securities as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date, because it is probable that we will sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives.\nWe recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments in debt securities below the cost basis of such securities is judged to be other-than-temporary. The determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different from our estimates. Factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations and the potential recovery period . For securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, the amount of impairment is recognized in the statement of income and is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, no other-than temporary impairment were recorded related to our marketable securities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement\n (a) Leases \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will replace the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases.\u201d The updated standard aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements - Leases (Topic 842).\" This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, the prior comparative period's financials will remain the same as those previously presented. We have elected to apply the guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption and not restate comparative periods and elected the available practical expedients on adoption.\nWe currently estimate recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.5 million on our consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact on our statement of income.\n (b) Other accounting standards \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which requires that expected credit losses relating to financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. ASU 2016-13 limits the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and also requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. The new standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt this standard and the potential effect of such adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, the income tax effects of tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the qualitative impairment test is necessary. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle should be disclosed upon transition. The amendments in this update should be adopted for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on our consolidated financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents line items from our consolidated

derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers. Sales to Spreadtrum represented 15%, 23% and 27% of our total revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Generally, the identity of our other customers representing 10% or more of our total revenues varies from period to period, especially with respect to our licensing customers as we generate licensing revenues generally from new customers on a quarterly basis. With respect to our royalty revenues, three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2018, and collectively represented 76% of our total royalty revenues for 2018. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2017, and collectively represented 70% of our total royalty revenues for 2017. Two royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2016, and collectively represented 80% of our total royalty revenues for 2016. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customers is explainable in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry. The loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our near-term future operating results.\nThe following table sets forth the products and services as percentages of our total revenues in each of the periods set forth below:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DSP products (DSP cores and platforms):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baseband for handset and other devices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-baseband (audio, imaging and vision)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connectivity products (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and SATA/SAS)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues for 2019 from the above products and services.\nLicensing and related revenue\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing and related revenue (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicensing and related revenues in 2017 and 2018 surpassed the $40 million level for the first time in CEVA's history. Historically, CEVA recorded levels of $20 million or $30 million per year. This new elevated level of licensing and related revenue is a direct outcome of our diversification strategy that was put in place in 2014, concurrently with the acquisition of RivieraWaves. The decrease in licensing and related revenues from 2017 to 2018 principally reflected a decrease in vision and base station related licensing deals, partially offset by higher revenues from licensing of connectivity IPs of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi related products. The increase in licensing and related revenues from 2016 to 2017 principally reflected strong demand throughout the year for our products, in particular vision, deep neural networks, 5G base stations, backhaul and cellular IoT, offset by lower handset baseband licensing deals.\nOur higher licensing and related revenue in recent years reflect organic growth and investments in our research and development efforts that have strengthened our successful diversification strategy to develop and license products outside our traditional handset baseband markets. A steady growth in licensees in diversified markets is the key driver for new royalty streams, in addition to incremental revenues from our existing royalty sources. At our investor and analyst day in January 2019, we disclosed that we have 40 royalty paying customers today and additionally, 60 customers are actively designing new chips incorporating our technologies, which we expect to gradually roll out for production over the coming years. We believe that this customer base will approximately double our annual royalty revenue in 2022. Our licensing business made solid progress in 2018, with 49 license agreements signed, including 16 first-time customers. These customers are targeting a range of large and diversified markets, including 5G, cellular IoT, AI, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. With more than 140 signed in the previous three years, we form the foundation necessary for significant market share expansion and royalty revenue growth in the coming years.\nLicensing and related revenue accounted for 51.9% of our total revenues for 2018, compared with 49.0% and 43.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRoyalty Revenues\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenues (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate royalty revenues from our customers who ship units of chips incorporating our technologies. Until the end of 2017, our royalties were invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606. Under the new standard, our royalty revenues represent what our customers shipped during any quarter in 2018, or our best estimates for such shipments. The royalty rate is based either on a certain percent of the chipset price or a fixed amount per chipset based on volume discounts.\nBased on internal data and Strategy Analytics' provisional worldwide shipment data, CEVA's worldwide market share of handset baseband chips that incorporate our technologies represented approximately 24%, 36% and 35% of the worldwide baseband volume in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and accounted for approximately 77%, 82% and 91% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur 2018 royalty business was impacted by headwinds in the handset market and the slower than originally anticipated expansion at our base station customers. Nevertheless, we continued to strengthen our footprint in our non-baseband markets, with shipments of more than 370 million devices, up 41% year over year. In particular, in the fast-growing Bluetooth space, we shipped more than 300 million devices in 2018. The increase in royalty revenues from 2016 to 2017 reflects higher non-handset baseband licensing revenues in recent years that contributed to higher-non handset baseband royalties in 2017, mainly from a new base station royalty payer, Bluetooth market expansion and vision based products, slightly offset by lower handset baseband royalties due to softness at low tier smartphone shipments.\nAs we enter 2019, we expect the elevated inventories in handsets to add to the usual seasonal weakness in our near-term royalties. With that said, we do expect continued expansion at our non-handset and base station customers, along with a recovery in handsets in the latter part of 2019. All in all, we are very excited by the market adoption of our leading-edge technologies in key growth areas, and believe we are on track to more than double our royalty revenue business in 2022.\nThe five largest royalty-paying customers accounted for 86% of our total royalty revenues for 2018, compared to 88% of our total royalty revenues for 2017 and 92% of our total royalty revenues for 2016.\nOur customers reported sales of 929 million chipsets incorporating our technologies in 2018, compared to 1,156 million in 2017 and 1,076 million in 2016. The decrease in units shipped in 2018 as compared to 2017 was attributable to a significant decrease in handset market volume shipments, partially offset by an increase in Bluetooth shipments. The increase in units shipped in 2017 as compared to 2016 was also attributable to a significant increase in Bluetooth shipments and first time ramp up volumes from our vision customers.\nGeographic Revenue Analysis\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe, Middle East (EME) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia Pacific (APAC) (1) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) China\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) S.

The decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the United States from 2016 to 2017 reflected lower licensing and royalty revenues mainly due to less design starts and licensing activities, and a continued design-out of two of our handset baseband customers.\nThe increase in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the EME region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected higher royalty revenues due to a share gain at a large U.S. handset OEM coupled by higher ASP for LTE shipments, offset by lower licensing revenues. The slight increase in revenues in absolute dollars and the decrease in percentage in the EME region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected lower licensing revenues for base station applications offset by higher royalty revenues, mainly from handset baseband products.\nThe decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage in the APAC region from 2017 to 2018 primarily reflected significantly lower handset baseband royalties following a challenging year for the entire cellular industry, in particular in the first half of 2018. The increase in revenues in absolute dollars in the APAC region from 2016 to 2017 primarily reflected higher licensing activities associated with many of our newer non-handset baseband customers and technologies for base stations and vision, as well as higher royalties, mainly from a first time base station customer that ramped up production in 2017.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenues accounted for 10.2% of our total revenues for 2018, compared to 7.9% of our total revenues for 2017 and 8.4% of our total revenues for 2016. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, and the amortization of intangible assets. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, higher third party IP costs (associated with the NB-IoT product line), higher payments to the Israeli Innovation Authority of the Ministry of Economy and Industry in Israel (the IIA\u201d) and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower customization work for our licensees.\nCost of revenues includes labor-related costs and, where applicable, costs related to overhead, subcontractors, materials, travel, royalty expenses payments to the IIA, amortization of acquired intangible assets (NB-IoT technologies) and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in cost of revenues for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $588,000, $459,000 and $246,000, respectively. Royalty expenses relate to royalties payable to the IIA that amount to 3%-3.5% of the actual sales of certain of our products, the development of which previously included grants from the IIA. The obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual sales of these products. Amortization of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies in the first quarter of 2018. Our amortization charges were $0.3 million for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the net amount of intangible assets related to the purchase of a license of NB-IoT technologies was $1.9 million.\nWe anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in 2019 as compared to prior years, partially due to higher expenses of approximately $1.7 million for engineering customization related expenses that will be allocated from our research and developments costs to cost of revenue on a 5G related license deal that was concluded in 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administration\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change year-on-year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total operating expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 principally reflected higher salary and employee related costs, mainly due to higher headcount, and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses.

The net increase in research and development expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected higher salary and related costs, mainly due to higher headcount associated with accelerated strategic research and development programs and collaborations with our customers to expedite their production ramp-ups, lower research grants received from the IIA and higher non-cash equity-based compensation expenses associated with our employee retention efforts. The average number of research and development personnel in 2018 was 238, compared to 217 in 2017 and 194 in 2016. The number of research and development personnel was 254 at December 31, 2018 as compared to 228 in 2017 and 199 in 2016.\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses cost will continue to increase in 2019. With our newly announced products and continued momentum with our existing licensing business, we will continue to innovate and reinforce our leadership, but with disciplined investments in research and developments costs. The increase will be approximately $4 million, mainly associated with investments in headcount, employee-related costs and EDA tools.\nResearch and development expenses, net of related government grants and French research tax benefits applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Imp\u00f4t Recherche ( CIR\u201d), were 61.3% of our total revenues for 2018, as compared with 46.2% for 2017 and 42.4% for 2016. We recorded research grants under funding programs of $3,352,000 in 2018, compared with $4,137,000 in 2017 and $6,410,000 in 2016. We recorded CIR benefits of $2,065,000, $1,555,000 and $1,485,000 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs, facilities expenses associated with research and development activities, project-related expenses connected with the development of our intellectual property which are expensed as incurred, and non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expenses included in research and development expenses, net for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $5,141,000, $3,839,000 and $2,860,000, respectively. Research and development expenses are net of related government research grants and research tax benefits applicable to CIR. We view research and development as a principal strategic investment and have continued our commitment to invest heavily in this area, which represents the largest of our ongoing operating expenses. We will need to continue to invest in research and development and such expenses may increase in the future to keep pace with new trends in our industry.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expenses (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td>"}
