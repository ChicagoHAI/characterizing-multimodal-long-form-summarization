Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of BankUnited, Inc. and its subsidiary (the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\") and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying footnotes and supplemental financial data included herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled \"Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\" We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Response\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governmental authorities implemented a number of measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19 such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activities. While many of these restrictions are beginning to ease and economic activity has started to resume, the pandemic and these precautionary measures have negatively impacted the global and domestic economies, including in the Company's primary market areas. Certain sectors to which the\nCompany has credit exposure, such as travel and hospitality and retail have been particularly impacted. The response of the U.S. Government to the economic impact of the crisis was swift and broad-based. The government has taken a series of actions to support individuals, households and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic including enactment and subsequent extension of the CARES Act. The Federal Reserve also enacted a suite of facilities using its emergency lending powers designed to support liquidity and the flow of credit. Banking regulators reduced reserve requirements and enacted rules designed to support financial institutions in their efforts to work with customers during this time. While development of vaccines and improvements in treatments for the virus are positive signs and economic indicators have shown improvement over the latter half of 2020, there remains a high level of uncertainty about the future trajectory of the virus and its ultimate impact on the economy and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA summary of the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our Company and of our expectations about how our Company may be impacted in the future follows. These matters are discussed in further detail throughout this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations and financial condition at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Deterioration in economic conditions led to a higher provision for credit losses and ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on future credit loss expense and future levels of the ACL, but they may be more volatile and may change materially from current levels. Future levels of the ACL could be significantly impacted, in either direction, by changes in the economic outlook and by the evolving impact of COVID-19 on individual borrowers in the portfolio.\n\u2022Levels of criticized and classified assets have increased, largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact or potential impact on our borrowers. Additionally, a significant number of borrowers requested and were granted relief in the form of temporary payment deferrals or modifications. Risk ratings were re-evaluated for a substantial portion of the commercial portfolio during 2020, with a particular focus on portfolio segments we identified for enhanced monitoring and loans for which we granted temporary payment deferrals or modifications in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, non-performing assets had increased to $247.6 million from $208.7 million at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to predict whether or to what extent levels of non-performing assets and delinquencies will further increase as a result of the pandemic, although they may do so. Similarly, charge-offs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year and may increase further. These impacts may manifest in a delayed fashion due to temporary payment deferrals and modifications and various forms of government assistance that our borrowers may receive.\n\u2022The level of commercial loan origination activity, outside of our participation in the PPP, was lower in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nVolatility in our share price increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020 and in June 2020 we issued $300 million in subordinated debt to strengthen our capital position during this challenging economic environment. In January 2021 our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of our suspended share repurchase program.\nAlthough we took significant measures to prepare for possible disruptions in liquidity, we have not experienced such disruptions to date and continue to have sufficient levels of available liquidity.\nThe pandemic has impacted our operations. Currently, the substantial majority of our non-branch employees are working remotely. We did not experience any significant operational difficulties, technology failures or outages, or customer service disruptions in our transition to a remote work environment. 86% of our branches remain open to serve customers via drive-through or lobby appointments, in some cases operating with reduced hours. Generally, branch locations without drive-through facilities are temporarily closed. We have focused on ensuring that our technology systems and internal controls continue to operate effectively in a remote work environment. We have put mechanisms in place to allow us to evaluate all significant modifications to processes and procedures to insure continued effectiveness of our control environment. We have not identified any instances in which our control environment has failed to operate effectively.\nCustomer demand for our products and services, particularly lending products, has been and may continue to be negatively affected by the impact of the pandemic on their businesses or by social distancing measures. Potential borrowers impacted by the pandemic may no longer meet our underwriting criteria. Loan production in many portfolio segments may continue to be muted, at least over the first half of 2021. While we currently expect loan production to begin to grow by the second half of 2021, our ability to increase production will depend on the future trajectory of the pandemic and on the pace and timing of economic recovery.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have prioritized risk management and implemented a number of measures to support our customers, employees and communities. Specifically, we have:\n\u2022Activated and continue to operate under our business continuity plan under the leadership of executive management.\n\u2022Enhanced liquidity monitoring and management protocols.\n\u2022Maintained a regular cadence of Board of Directors update calls.\n\u2022Enhanced the level and frequency of pro-active outreach to borrowers and our portfolio management activities.\n\u2022Segregated certain segments of the loan portfolio for enhanced monitoring.\n\u2022Enhanced our workout and recovery staffing and processes.\n\u2022Enhanced our stress testing framework. Results of internal stress testing indicate that we have sufficient capital to withstand an increase in credit losses materially beyond levels currently expected, and to withstand a severe downturn.\n\u2022Proactively reached out to our critical third party service providers and evaluated their ability to continue to provide support in the current environment. We have experienced no significant service disruptions.\n\u2022Expanded certain employee benefits and launched a number of programs to keep our employees healthy and engaged.\n\u2022Enhanced personal protective measures for employees working at our corporate locations and begun planning for the eventual return to office of a larger percentage of our workforce, when conditions permit.\n\u2022Supported our clients through participating in the Small Business Administration's PPP, the Federal Reserve's MSLF program and granting payment deferrals, loan modifications and fee waivers on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022Temporarily halted new residential foreclosure actions.\n\u2022Disbursed over 150 grants to nonprofit organizations across our footprint, including an end of year donation of $100,000 to local food banks.\n\u2022Continued helping to meet the various needs of our community partners through over 1,500 employee \"virtual\" volunteer hours during the pandemic.\nWe remain confident in our long-term underlying strength and stability, and our ability to navigate these challenging conditions.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020 for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.\nPerformance Highlights\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we consider the level of and trends in net interest income, the net interest margin, the cost of deposits, levels and composition of non-interest income and non-interest expense, performance ratios such as the return on average equity and return on average assets and asset quality ratios, including the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, non-performing assets to total assets, trends in criticized and classified assets and portfolio delinquency and charge-off trends. We consider growth in earning assets and deposits, particularly non-interest bearing deposits, trends in funding mix and cost of funds. We analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions.\nPerformance highlights include:\n\u2022Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $197.9 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $313.1 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the return on average stockholders' equity was 6.9% and the return on average assets was 0.57%. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the application of CECL, including the impact of COVID-19 on the provision for credit losses.\n\u2022PPNR improved to $427.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $412.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $751.8 million, essentially flat to the prior year. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the ACL was $257 million, or 1.08% of loans compared to $109 million or 0.47% of loans at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss model, of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses and the ACL resulted from the application of the CECL methodology and the impact on expected credit losses of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The average cost of total deposits decreased to 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.63% for 2019. On a spot basis, the average APY on total deposits declined to 0.36% at December 31, 2020 from 1.42% at December 31, 2019. This decline in the cost of deposits reflects both our ongoing strategy to increase non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits and to reduce rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, as well as declines in market interest rates generally.\n\u2022Total deposits increased by $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $2.7 billion or 88% was non-interest bearing demand deposits. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 63% in 2020, to 25% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. The following charts illustrate the composition of deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022Interest earning assets grew by $2.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Loans grew by $711 million; we saw growth in PPP loans and the residential and mortgage warehouse portfolio sub-segments while other portfolio sub-segments declined. Investment securities grew by $1.4 billion as liquidity was deployed into the securities portfolio in a challenging credit environment.\n\u2022Loans on deferral totaled $207 million or less than 1% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Loans modified under the CARES Act totaled $587 million at December 31, 2020. In the aggregate, this represents $794 million or 3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, down from $3.6 billion or 15% of total loans that were granted an initial 90 day deferral as reported at the end of the second quarter. See section entitled \"Asset Quality-Payment Deferrals and Modifications\" for further details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% subordinated notes, augmenting Tier 2 capital.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $101 million, at a weighted average price of $30.36. The Company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program on March 16, 2020. On January 20, 2021, the Company's Board\nof Directors reinstated the share repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase up to approximately $44.9 million in shares of its outstanding common stock remains under the program.\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2020, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by $0.02 to $0.23 per share, reflecting a 10% increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and has maintained that quarterly dividend level throughout 2020.\n\u2022Book value per common share grew to $32.05 at December 31, 2020 from $31.33 at December 31, 2019 while tangible book value per common share increased to $31.22 from $30.52 over the same period.\n\u2022The Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded all regulatory \"well capitalized\" guidelines. The charts below present the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios compared to regulatory guidelines at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nBankUnited, Inc.\nBankUnited, N.A.:\nStrategic Priorities\nManagement has identified the following strategic priorities for our Company:\n\u2022Maximizing risk adjusted returns through a combination of sustainable, diversified and prudently managed organic growth and capital optimization.\n\u2022Growing core deposit relationships.\n\u2022Building a foundational and scalable small business and middle-market franchise.\n\u2022Emphasizing growth in areas where our delivery model is a differentiator.\n\u2022Continuing to execute on our BankUnited 2.0 revenue generating initiatives.\n\u2022Investing in digital capabilities, automation and data analytics.\n\u2022Maintaining an efficient, effective and scalable support model through operational excellence.\n\u2022Monitoring the M&A landscape while growing organically.\nSome of the challenges confronting our Company, which may also impact the banking industry more broadly, include:\n\u2022The current interest rate environment, characterized by generally low interest rates, and relatively tight spreads, may impact our ability to achieve margin expansion.\n\u2022The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis on the economy, our borrowers, our employees and the work environment and demand for our products and services.\n\u2022Regulatory changes and other policy implications that may follow the recent change in the political landscape.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve a heightened level of management judgment due to the complexity, subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nACL\nThe ACL represents management's estimate of current expected credit losses, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, on our loan portfolio and the amount of credit loss impairment on our AFS securities portfolio. Determining the amount of the ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires extensive judgment and estimation. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the ACL include:\n\u2022our evaluation of current conditions;\n\u2022our determination of a reasonable and supportable economic forecast;\n\u2022our evaluation of historical loss experience;\n\u2022our evaluation of changes in composition and characteristic of the loan portfolio, including internal risk ratings;\n\u2022our estimate of expected prepayments;\n\u2022the value of underlying collateral, which may impact loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions for collateral-dependent, criticized and classified loans;\n\u2022our selection and evaluation of qualitative factors;\n\u2022the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from PCD loans; and\n\u2022our estimate of expected cash flows on AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the ACL.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings. Net interest income is impacted by the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources, movements in market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, levels of non-performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors.\nThe mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand, market and competitive conditions in our primary lending markets, by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets and liquidity considerations. The mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by the Company's liquidity profile, management's assessment of the desire for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth expectations, our ability to attract and retain core deposit relationships, competition for deposits in the Company's markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.\nThe following table presents, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of taxable equivalent interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Non-accrual and restructured loans are included in the average balances presented in this table; however, interest income foregone on non-accrual loans is not included. Interest income, yields, spread and margin have been calculated on a tax-equivalent basis for loans and investment securities that are exempt from federal income taxes, at a federal tax rate of 21% (dollars in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was $769.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $773.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.0 million. The decrease in net interest income was comprised of decreases in tax-equivalent interest income and in interest expense of $217.3 million and $213.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tax-equivalent interest income was driven primarily by decreases in interest income from loans and investment securities of $119.0 million and $87.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases resulted from declines in market interest rates including the impact of repayment of assets originated in a higher rate environment, partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets. The decline in interest expense on deposits was the largest component of the overall decline in interest expense and reflected decreases in the level of market interest rates as well as the impact of our strategy focused on improving the deposit mix and reducing the rates paid on deposits.\nThe net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline in the yield on interest earning assets outpaced the reduction in cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year.\nOffsetting factors contributing to the decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 included:\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities decreased to 2.25% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted from the impact of purchases of lower-yielding securities, prepayments of higher yielding mortgage-backed securities and decreases in coupon interest rates on existing floating rate assets.\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on loans decreased to 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 4.43% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to this decrease included the decline in benchmark interest rates which impacted the rates earned on both existing floating rate assets and new production, the addition of lower yielding PPP loans, and the runoff of loans originated in a higher rate environment..\n\u2022The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to 1.00% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline reflected continued initiatives taken to lower rates paid on deposits in response to declines in general market interest rates and the re-pricing of term deposits. We expect the cost of interest bearing deposits to continue to decline.\n\u2022The average rate paid on FHLB and PPPLF borrowings declined to 1.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.36% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting declines in market interest rates and the impact of PPPLF borrowings priced at rates lower than the average paid on FHLB advances.\n\u2022The increase in average non-interest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of average total deposits positively impacted the cost of total deposits and the net interest margin.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings required to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost at the balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is impacted by changes in current economic conditions as well as in management's reasonable and supportable economic forecast, loan originations and runoff, changes in portfolio mix, risk rating migration and portfolio seasoning, changes in specific reserves, changes in expected prepayment speeds and other assumptions. The provision for credit losses also includes amounts related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, accrued interest receivable and AFS debt securities.\nThe following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to funded portion of loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to off-balance sheet credit exposures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,572) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to accrued interest receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses - AFS debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,431 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was determined using the CECL methodology and included management's estimate of the expected negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss methodology of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from both the adoption of the CECL methodology and the impact of COVID-19.\nThe evolving COVID-19 situation may lead to increased volatility in the provision for credit losses and if economic conditions or forecasts deteriorate further as a result of COVID-19, the provision for credit losses and the ACL will likely increase.\nThe determination of the amount of the ACL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d below and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the ACL.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents a comparison of the categories of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit service charges and fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of covered loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed portions of SBA loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GNMA early buyout loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of loans, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on investment securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains on sale of securities AFS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,944) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on investment securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposit service charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by fee waivers and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19.\nThe increase in gain on sale of GNMA early buyout loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from an increase in the volume of activity.\nThe decrease in gains on guaranteed portions of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was a result of declining origination volume of SBA loans as resources were re-directed to the PPP. The gain on sale of other loans in 2019 was primarily related to a gain on sale of Pinnacle loans totaling $2.4 million.\nThe decrease in income from lease financing for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributed to the increase in operating lease equipment off-lease and re-leasing of assets at lower rates.\nThe most significant factor leading to the decrease in other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was lower revenue from interest rate derivative contracts with our commercial borrowers.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FDIC indemnification asset </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and telecommunications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,136 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of operating lease equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>457,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FDIC indemnification </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(261,763) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of operating lease equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,493) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,025) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,796) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs incurred directly related to implementation of BankUnited 2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,802) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,899) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,758) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring operating expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>419,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>436,853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Recurring operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure. See section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measurements to their comparable GAAP financial measurements.\nEmployee compensation and benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits declined by $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative. Lower variable compensation costs and the impact of a declining stock price on liability-classified awards also contributed to reduced expense levels.\nOccupancy and equipment\nOccupancy and equipment decreased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases were a result of cost reductions stemming from our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nDeposit insurance expense\nDeposit insurance expense increased by $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in the assessment rate.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees decreased by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the consulting services in 2019 related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nTechnology and telecommunications\nTechnology and telecommunications increased by $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is reflective of investments in digital and data analytics capabilities and in the infrastructure to support cloud migration as well as some costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther non-interest expense\nThe most significant components of other non-interest expense are advertising, promotion and business development, costs related to lending activities, loan servicing and deposit generation, insurance, expenses related to workouts and foreclosures, regulatory examination assessments, travel and general office expense. Decreases are related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative, and in some cases, reduced levels of activity stemming from the COVID pandemic.\nExpenses related directly to COVID-19 for year ended December 31, 2020 included technology and consulting costs related to our participation in the PPP; laptops and other equipment to facilitate employees working remotely; costs related to cleaning, sanitizing and personal protective equipment; other facilities expenses related to preparation for an eventual return of more employees to our offices; and an accrual for rollover vacation days provided to employees.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $51.5 million and $90.9 million, respectively. The Company's effective income tax rate was 20.7% and 22.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about income taxes.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion to $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $31.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by an $833 million increase in the average balance of outstanding loans, related in part to PPP loans originated in 2020. Average interest bearing liabilities declined by $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, while average non-interest bearing deposits increased by $1.8 billion to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTotal deposits increased by $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, while total borrowings declined by $1.0 billion. Investment securities increased by $1.4 billion and total loans increased by $711 million. Investment securities represented 26% of total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019. This is reflective of the deployment of liquidity into the securities portfolio in the challenging lending environment predicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table

strategy has focused on insuring adequate liquidity, maintaining a suitable balance of high credit quality, diverse assets, managing interest rate risk, and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters. We have sought to maintain liquidity by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities including U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency and sponsored enterprise securities. Investment grade municipal securities provide liquidity and attractive tax-equivalent yields. We have also invested in highly rated structured products, including private-label commercial and residential MBS, collateralized loan obligations, single family rental real estate-backed securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities that, while somewhat less liquid, provide us with attractive yields. Relatively short effective portfolio duration helps mitigate interest rate risk. Based on the Company's assumptions, the estimated weighted average life of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 4.8 years. The effective duration of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 1.5 years. The model results are based on assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nThe investment securities available for sale portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $85.6 million at December 31, 2020, with aggregate fair value equal to 101% of amortized cost. The portfolio has recovered in value from a net realized loss position of $249.8 million at March 31, 2020 that resulted from uncertainty and volatility in the markets immediately following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unrealized losses at March 31, 2020 were primarily concentrated in the CLO and Private Label CMBS asset classes. Net unrealized gains at December 31, 2020 included $117.1 million of gross unrealized gains and $31.4 million of gross unrealized losses. Investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020 had an aggregate fair value of $3.3 billion. The majority of the unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 related to the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments. The ratings distribution of our AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 is depicted in the chart below:\nWe evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investments in unrealized loss positions. This evaluation considers, but is not necessarily limited to, the following factors, the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security:\n\u2022Whether we intend to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022Whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022The extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost;\n\u2022Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area;\n\u2022Changes in the financial condition of the issuer or underlying loan obligors;\n\u2022The payment structure and remaining payment terms of the security, including levels of subordination or over-collateralization;\n\u2022Failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments;\n\u2022Changes in credit ratings;\n\u2022Relevant market data;\n\u2022Estimated prepayments, defaults, and the value and performance of underlying collateral at the individual security level.\nAn ACL of $0.4 million was recorded related to one private label CMBS security during the year ended December 31, 2020. This security is not projected to sustain credit losses and management does not intend to sell the security at the balance sheet date. However, due to negative underlying collateral performance trends the security is being closely monitored and management may determine not to hold the security until full recovery of its amortized cost basis. No securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not intend to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions at December 31, 2020. Based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nThe timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government. As such, there is an assumption of zero credit loss and the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.\nNone of our private label securities in unrealized loss positions had missed principal or interest payments or had been downgraded by a NRSRO at December 31, 2020. The Company performed an analysis comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of impaired securities. This analysis was based on a scenario that we believe to be generally more severe than our reasonable and supportable economic forecast at December 31, 2020, and incorporated assumptions about voluntary prepayment rates, collateral defaults, delinquencies, severity and other relevant factors. Our analysis also considered the structural characteristics of each security and the level of credit enhancement provided by that structure. Based on the results of this analysis, none of the private label AFS securities in unrealized loss positions were projected to sustain credit losses at December 31, 2020. Further information about the portfolio segments evidencing the largest unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments, follows.\nFor private label CMBS, our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, voluntary prepayment rates, loss severity, delinquencies and recovery lag. In developing those assumptions, we took into account collateral quality and type, loan size, loan purpose and other qualitative factors. We also regularly monitor collateral watchlists, bankruptcy data, special servicing trends, delinquency and other economic data which would indicate further stress in the sector.\nFor CLOs, our analysis of cash flows expected to be collected incorporated assumptions about collateral default rates, loss severity, and delinquencies, calibrated to take into account idiosyncratic risks associated with the underlying collateral. In developing those assumptions, we took into account each sector's performance pre, during and post the 2008 financial crisis. We regularly engage with bond managers to monitor trends in underlying collateral including potential downgrades and subsequent cash flow diversions, liquidity, ratings migration, and any other relevant developments.\nThe following table presents the distribution of third-party ratings and subordination levels compared to average stress scenario losses based on our credit loss impairment analysis of the private label CMBS and CLOs at December 31, 2020:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Subordination </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Stress Scenario Loss </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private label CMBS </td> <td>AAA </td> <td> </td> <td>89.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>96.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>AA </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>38.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>92.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CLOs </td> <td>AAA </td> <td> </td> <td>83.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>AA </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>46.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further discussion of our analysis of impaired investment securities AFS for credit loss impairment see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe use third-party pricing services to assist us in estimating the fair value of investment securities. We perform a variety of procedures to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used by the pricing services including obtaining and reviewing written documentation of the methods and assumptions employed, conducting interviews with valuation desk personnel and reviewing model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary. Our classification of prices within the fair value hierarchy is based on an evaluation of the nature of the significant assumptions impacting the valuation of each type of security in the portfolio. We have established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by our treasury front office of all prices provided on a monthly basis. Any price evidencing unexpected month over month fluctuations or deviations from our expectations based on recent observed trading activity and other information available in the marketplace that would impact the value of the security is challenged. Responses to the price challenges, which generally include specific information about inputs and assumptions incorporated in the valuation and their sources, are reviewed in detail. If considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies, a price will be obtained from additional independent valuation sources. We do not typically adjust the prices provided, other than through this established challenge process. Our primary pricing services utilize observable inputs when available, and employ unobservable inputs and proprietary models only when observable inputs are not available. As a matter of course, the services validate prices by comparison to recent trading activity whenever such activity exists. Quotes obtained from the pricing services are typically non-binding.\nWe also have a quarterly price validation process to assess the propriety of the pricing methodologies utilized by our primary pricing services by independently verifying the prices of a sample of securities in the portfolio. Sample sizes vary based on the type of security being priced, with higher sample sizes applied to more difficult to value security types. Verification procedures may consist of obtaining prices from an additional outside source. We have established acceptable percentage deviations from the price provided by the initial pricing source. If deviations fall outside the established parameters, we will obtain and evaluate more detailed information about the assumptions and inputs used by each pricing source or, if considered necessary, employ an additional valuation source to price the security in question. Pricing issues identified through this evaluation are addressed with the applicable pricing service and methodologies or inputs are revised as determined necessary. Depending on the results of the validation process, sample sizes may be extended for particular classes of securities. Results of the validation process are reviewed by the treasury front office and by senior management.\nThe majority of our investment securities are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified within level 1 of the hierarchy. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on markets, and on our ability to price securities in our portfolio. While, particularly at the onset of the pandemic, we observed increased volatility and dislocation, we believe the fiscal and monetary response to the crisis has been effective in supporting liquidity and stabilizing markets. To date, circumstances have not led to a change in the categorization of our fair value estimates within the fair value hierarchy.\nFor additional discussion of the fair values of investment securities, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table shows the weighted average prospective yields, categorized by scheduled maturity, for AFS investment securities as of December 31, 2020.

Loan growth for the year was driven by $782 million in PPP loans and a $491 million increase in mortgage warehouse outstandings, due to growth in commitments and increased utilization, as well as growth in GNMA early buyout loans. Growth in these portfolio sub-segments was offset by net runoff in other commercial and commercial real estate segments. The decline in multi-family balances was driven primarily by\ncontinued runoff of the New York portfolio. Residential and other consumer loans grew by $687 million due to growth of $723 million in GNMA early buyout loans. The residential portfolio excluding GNMA early buyout loans experienced a net decline of approximately $35 million driven by higher prepayment speeds in the current rate environment.\nResidential mortgages and other consumer loans\nThe following table shows the composition of residential and other consumer loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 single family residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,922,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,953,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government insured residential </td> <td>1,419,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>698,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer loans </td> <td>6,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,348,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,661,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 1-4 single family residential loan portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans, is primarily comprised of loans purchased through established correspondent channels. 1-4 single family residential mortgage loans are primarily closed-end, first lien jumbo mortgages for the purchase or re-finance of owner occupied property. The loans have terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. At December 31, 2020, $541 million or 11% were secured by investor-owned properties.\nThe Company acquires non-performing FHA and VA insured mortgages from third party servicers who have exercised their right to purchase these loans out of GNMA securitizations (collectively, \"government insured pool buyout loans\" or \"buyout loans\"). Buyout loans that re-perform, either through modification or self-cure, may be eligible for re-securitization. The Company and the servicer share in the economics of the sale of these loans into new securitizations. The balance of buyout loans totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company is not the servicer of these loans.\nThe following charts present the distribution of the 1-4 single family residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nSee Note 4 to the

COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers' financial condition or property values.\nThe Company's commercial real estate underwriting standards generally provide for loan terms of five to seven years, with amortization schedules of no more than thirty years. LTV ratios are typically limited to no more than 75%. Construction and\nland loans, included by property type in the table above, represented only 1.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Construction loans are generally made for projects expected to stabilize within eighteen months of completion in sub-markets with strong fundamentals and, to a lesser extent, for-sale residential projects to experienced developers with a strong cushion between market prices and loan basis. 74% of the commercial real estate portfolio, including 79% and 55% of the retail and hotel segments, respectively, had LTVs less than 65% at December 31, 2020.\nIncluded in the table above are approximately $264 million of mixed-use properties in New York, consisting of $194 million categorized as multi-family, $51 million categorized as retail and $19 million categorized as office.\nThe New York legislature has enacted a number of rent regulation reform measures that generally have the impact of limiting landlords' ability to increase rents on stabilized units and to convert stabilized units to market rate units. The New York multi-family portfolio included $866 million of loans collateralized by properties with some or all of the units subject to rent regulation at December 31, 2020, substantially all of which were stabilized properties.\nThe following tables present the distribution of stabilized rent-regulated multi-family loans, by DSCR and LTV at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DSCR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 1.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,974 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.11 - 1.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,825 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.25 - 1.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.51 or greater </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>217,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>845,491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LTV </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than 50% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50% - 65% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>66% - 75% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than 75% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>845,491 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe LTVs in the table above are based on the most recent appraisal obtained, which may not be fully reflective of changes in valuations that may result from the impact of the rent regulation reforms, or of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loans with DSCR less than 1.11 may be those with temporary vacancies, those for which expenses, particularly real estate taxes, have increased more rapidly than rents, or those with rent reductions.\nCommercial and industrial loans are typically made to small, middle market and larger corporate businesses and not-for-profit entities and include equipment loans, secured and unsecured working capital facilities, formula-based loans, trade finance, SBA product offerings and business acquisition finance credit facilities. These loans may be structured as term loans, typically with maturities of five to seven years, or revolving lines of credit which may have multi-year maturities. The Bank also provides financing to state and local governmental entities generally within our geographic markets. Commercial loans included shared national credits totaling $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, the majority of which were relationship based loans to borrowers in Florida and New York. The Bank makes loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate that typically have risk profiles more closely aligned with that of commercial and industrial loans than with other types of commercial real estate loans.\nThe following table presents the exposure in the commercial and industrial portfolio, including $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, by industry at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and Insurance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,054,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Educational Services </td> <td>654,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Trade </td> <td>652,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation and Warehousing </td> <td>471,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health Care and Social Assistance </td> <td>442,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing </td> <td>342,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information </td> <td>330,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate and Rental and Leasing </td> <td>309,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accommodation and Food Services </td> <td>299,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Trade </td> <td>297,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services </td> <td>273,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td>251,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Administration </td> <td>238,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Services (except Public Administration) </td> <td>229,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative and Support and Waste Management </td> <td>199,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation </td> <td>186,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilities </td> <td>173,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>40,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,448,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThrough its commercial lending subsidiaries, Pinnacle and Bridge, the Bank provides equipment and franchise financing on a national basis using both loan and lease structures. Pinnacle provides essential-use equipment financing to state and local governmental entities directly and through vendor programs and alliances. Pinnacle offers a full array of financing structures including equipment lease purchase agreements and direct (private placement) bond re-fundings and loan agreements. Bridge has two operating divisions. The franchise finance division offers franchise acquisition, expansion and equipment financing, typically to experienced operators in well-established concepts. The franchise finance portfolio is made up primarily of quick service restaurant and fitness concepts comprising 60% and 33% of the portfolio, respectively. The equipment finance division provides primarily transportation equipment financing through a variety of loan and lease structures. The Bank also engages in mortgage warehouse lending on a national basis.\nThe Company originated over 3,500 SBA PPP loans totaling $876 million during the second quarter 2020. These loans bear interest at 1% and are guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA. They have terms of 2 years, and are eligible for earlier forgiveness under the terms of the PPP in prescribed circumstances. During the fourth quarter 2020, the Company began processing forgiveness applications with the SBA, resulting in a $48 million reduction in PPP loans. The Company recognized $1.3 million of interest income related to accelerated amortization of origination fees for PPP loans that were partially or fully forgiven during the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2020, $12 million of PPP origination fees remain to be recognized in income. The Company expects PPP forgiveness to continue during the first and second quarters of 2021. We will be participating in the PPP Second Draw Program to provide funding to eligible businesses who were given PPP First Draw loans.\nGeographic Concentrations\nThe Company's commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are concentrated in Florida and the Tri-state area. 53% and 39% of commercial real estate loans were secured by collateral located in Florida and the Tri-state area, respectively; while 38% and 24% of all other commercial loans were to borrowers in Florida and the Tri-state area, respectively.\nThe following table presents the five states with the largest concentration of commercial loans and leases originated through Bridge, Pinnacle and our mortgage warehouse finance unit at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>578,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NY Tri State Area </td> <td>545,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>337,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida </td> <td>330,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>389,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ohio </td> <td>194,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>34,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia </td> <td>186,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>133,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Others </td> <td>1,525,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,809,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,392,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,283,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio by category, excluding government insured residential loans.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have further enhanced our workout and recovery staffing and processes. Loan performance is monitored by our credit administration, portfolio management and workout and recovery departments. Generally, commercial relationships with balances in excess of defined thresholds are re-evaluated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. The defined thresholds range from $1 million to $3 million. Homogenous groups of smaller balance commercial loans may be monitored collectively. The credit quality and risk rating of commercial loans as well as our underwriting and portfolio management practices are regularly reviewed by our internal credit review department.\nWe believe internal risk rating is the best indicator of the credit quality of commercial loans. The Company utilizes a 16 grade internal asset risk classification system as part of its efforts to monitor and maintain commercial asset quality. The special mention rating is considered a transitional rating for loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that could result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date if not checked or corrected and that deserve management's close attention. These borrowers may exhibit declining cash flows or revenues or increasing leverage. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard. These borrowers may exhibit payment defaults, inadequate cash flows, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, exhausted interest reserves, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts or past due real estate taxes. Loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable, but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off, are assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful. During 2020, risk ratings were re-evaluated for a substantial portion of the commercial portfolio, with a particular\nfocus on portfolio segments we identified for enhanced monitoring and loans for which we granted temporary payment deferrals or modifications in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's commercial credit exposure, based on internal risk rating, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Commercial Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Commercial Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Commercial Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Commercial Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pass </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,832,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,321,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,169,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,054,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special mention </td> <td>711,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>951,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,338,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>72,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Substandard accruing </td> <td>1,758,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,376,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>560,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>180,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Substandard non-accruing </td> <td>203,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>187,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>187,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>185,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Doubtful </td> <td>11,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,517,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,838,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,257,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,493,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur internal risk ratings at December 31, 2020 were heavily influenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures and restrictions employed to contain the spread of the virus on the economy, our borrowers and the sectors in which they operate. Management has taken what we believe to be a proactive and objective approach to risk rating the commercial loan portfolio since the onset of the pandemic. The increase in levels of criticized and classified loans and migration within the criticized and classified categories over the course of 2020 is directly related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant uncertainty remains around the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, the roll-out of vaccines and related economic and social impacts. If economic conditions or the circumstances of individual borrowers deteriorate further, the amount of criticized and classified assets could continue to increase. It is also possible that an increasing trend in non-accrual loans may emerge in the future as temporary payment deferrals and modifications granted to some borrowers expire. If, on the other hand, the pace of economic recovery continues or accelerates over the course of 2021, we may see declines in the level of criticized and classified assets.\nThe following table provides additional information about special mention and substandard accruing loans, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands).

The deferred payments along with interest accrued during the deferral period are generally due and payable on the maturity date. CARES Act modifications represent longer-term modifications and most commonly have taken the form of 9 to 12 month interest only periods. The majority of loan modifications or deferrals and payment deferrals that took place after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been categorized as TDRs, in accordance with interagency and authoritative guidance and the provisions of the CARES Act.\nThe following table presents additional information, as of December 31, 2020, about loan portfolio sub-segments that, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, were identified for enhanced monitoring (dollars in thousands):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Performing </td> <td> </td> <td>Special Mention </td> <td> </td> <td>Substandard Accruing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail - CRE </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,368,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail - C&I </td> <td>297,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge - franchise finance </td> <td>549,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td>621,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Airlines and aviation authorities </td> <td>119,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cruise line </td> <td>70,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,029,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,083,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, 79% of commercial loans on deferral or modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 55% of criticized and classified assets were in the above portfolio sub-segments.\nRetail Exposure in the CRE Portfolio\nThe predominant collateral types supporting this sub-segment include both anchored and unanchored suburban and urban retail properties, some single tenant properties as well as some mixed-use properties in New York City with a significant retail component. We have no significant large shopping mall or \"big box\" exposure. The weighted average LTV for this sub-segment is 61% and 79% has LTVs less than 65%, based on the most recently available information.\nRetail Exposure in the C&I Portfolio\nThis is a well-diversified sub-segment by industry. The largest exposure is to gas stations, generally with convenience stores, representing $87 million, or 29% of the sub-segment. 68% of loans in this sub-segment are collateralized by owner-occupied real estate.\nBridge - Franchise Finance\nThe following table presents the franchise portfolio by concept at December 31, 2020:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Bridge -Franchise Finance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restaurant concepts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Burger King </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dunkin' Donuts </td> <td>28,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Popeyes </td> <td>27,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jimmy John's </td> <td>19,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domino's </td> <td>18,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>169,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>326,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-restaurant concepts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Planet Fitness </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Orange Theory Fitness </td> <td>85,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>40,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>223,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>549,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHotel\nMany hotels are experiencing significant disruption in revenue due to social distancing measures arising from the pandemic. The weighted average LTV for this sub-segment is 65% and 55% has LTVs less than 65%, based on the most recent information available. The majority of our hotel exposure is in Florida at 74%, followed by 16% in New York. This sub-segment includes $62 million in SBA loans. All but one of our hotel collateral properties have now re-opened for business.\nAirlines and Aviation Authorities\nThese borrowers have directly benefited from government relief programs enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Lease Equipment, net\nSix operating leases with a carrying value of assets under lease totaling $40 million, all of which were exposures to the energy industry, were internally risk rated substandard at December 31, 2020. On a quarterly basis, management performs an impairment analysis on assets with indicators of potential impairment. Potential impairment indicators include evidence of changes in residual value, macro-economic conditions, an extended period of time off-lease, criticized or classified status, or management's intention to sell the asset at an amount potentially below its carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,impairment charges recognized related to operating lease equipment were not material.\nThe primary risks inherent in the equipment leasing business are asset risk resulting from ownership of the equipment on lease and credit risk. Asset risk arises from fluctuations in supply and demand for the underlying leased equipment. The equipment is leased to commercial end users with original lease terms generally ranging from three to ten years. We are exposed to the risk that, at the end of the lease term, the value of the asset will be lower than expected, potentially resulting in reduced future lease income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value. Asset risk may also lead to changes in depreciation as a result of changes in the residual values of the leased assets or through impairment of asset carrying values.\nAsset risk is evaluated and managed by a dedicated internal staff of asset managers, managed by seasoned equipment finance professionals with a broad depth and breadth of experience in the leasing business. Additionally, we have partnered with an industry leading, experienced service provider who provides fleet management and servicing relating to the railcar fleet, including lease administration and reporting, a Regulation Y compliant full service maintenance program and railcar re-marketing. Risk is managed by setting appropriate residual values at inception and systematic reviews of residual values based on independent appraisals, performed at least annually. Additionally, our internal management team and our external service provider closely follow the rail markets, monitoring traffic flows, supply and demand trends and the impact of new technologies and regulatory requirements. Demand for railcars is sensitive to shifts in general and industry specific economic and market trends and shifts in trade flows from specific events such as natural or man-made disasters, including events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We seek to mitigate these risks by leasing to a stable end user base, by maintaining a relatively young\nand diversified fleet of assets that are expected to maintain stronger and more stable utilization rates despite impacts from unexpected events or cyclical trends and by staggering lease maturities. We regularly monitor the impact of oil prices on the estimated residual value of rail cars being used in the petroleum/natural gas extraction sector.\nCredit risk in the leased equipment portfolio results from the potential default of lessees, possibly driven by obligor specific or industry-wide conditions, and is economically less significant than asset risk, because in the operating lease business, there is no extension of credit to the obligor. Instead, the lessor deploys a portion of the useful life of the asset. Credit losses, if any, will manifest through reduced rental income due to missed payments, time off lease, or lower rental payments due either to a restructuring or re-leasing of the asset to another obligor. Credit risk in the operating lease portfolio is managed and monitored utilizing credit administration infrastructure, processes and procedures similar to those used to manage and monitor credit risk in the commercial loan portfolio. We also mitigate credit risk in this portfolio by leasing to high credit quality obligors.\nBridge had exposure to the energy industry of $329 million at December 31, 2020. The majority of the energy exposure was in the operating lease equipment portfolio where energy exposure totaled $279 million. The remaining energy exposure, totaling approximately $50 million was comprised of loans and direct or sales type finance leases.\nResidential and Other Consumer Loans\nOur residential mortgage portfolio, excluding GNMA buyout loans, consists primarily of loans purchased through established correspondent channels. Most of our purchases are of performing jumbo mortgage loans which have FICO scores above 700, primarily are owner-occupied and full documentation, and have a current LTV of 80% or less although loans with LTVs higher than 80% may be extended to selected credit-worthy borrowers. We perform due diligence on the purchased loans for credit, compliance, counterparty, payment history and property valuation.\nWe have a dedicated residential credit risk management function, and the residential portfolio is monitored by our internal credit review function. Residential mortgage loans and consumer loans are not individually risk rated. Delinquency status is the primary measure we use to monitor the credit quality of these loans. We also consider original LTV and most recently available FICO score to be significant indicators of credit quality for the 1-4 single family residential portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans.\nThe following charts present information about the 1-4 single family residential portfolio, excluding government insured loans, by FICO distribution, LTV distribution and vintage at December 31, 2020:\nFICO scores are generally updated at least annually, and were most recently updated in the third quarter of 2020. LTVs are typically based on valuation at origination since we do not routinely update residential appraisals.\nAt December 31, 2020, the majority of the 1-4 single family residential loan portfolio, excluding government insured residential loans, was owner-occupied, with 81% primary residence, 8% second homes and 11% investment properties.\n1-4 single family residential loans, excluding government insured residential loans, past due more than 30 days totaled $66 million at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of these loans 90 days or more past due was $9.2 million and $11.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Delinquency statistics as of December 31, 2020 may not be fully reflective of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residential borrowers due to payment deferral programs. Loans on deferral that are in compliance with the terms of the deferral program are not reported as delinquent.\nAt December 31, 2020, $525 million of residential loans, excluding government insured loans, had been granted an initial short term payment deferral. At December 31, 2020, $156 million or 2% of the 1-4 single family residential loans, excluding government insured residential loans, were under short-term deferral or modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table presents information about residential loans granted payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as of December 31, 2020, excluding government insured residential loans (dollars in thousands):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Loans That Have Rolled Off of Short-Term Deferral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans Still Under Short-Term Deferral </td> <td> </td> <td>Paying as Agreed </td> <td> </td> <td>Not Resumed Regular Payments </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans Initially Granted Short-Term Deferral(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans Rolled Off Short-Term Deferral </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans Rolled Off Short-Term Deferral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ </td> <td>144,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>362,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes $23 million of loans continuing to make payments\nFor residential borrowers, relief has typically initially taken the form of 90 day payment deferrals, with deferred payments due at the end of the 90 day period. At the end of the initial 90 day deferral period, residential borrowers may either (i) make all payments due, (ii) be granted an additional deferral period or (iii) enter into a modification or repayment plan.\nNote 4 to the consolidated financial statements presents additional information about key credit quality indicators and delinquency status of the loan portfolio.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets generally consist of (i) non-accrual loans, including loans that have been modified in TDRs or CARES Act modifications and placed on non-accrual status, (ii) accruing loans that are more than 90 days contractually past due as to interest or principal, excluding PCD loans for which management has a reasonable basis for an expectation about future cash flows and government insured residential loans, and (iii) OREO and repossessed assets.\nThe following table and charts summarize the Company's non-performing loans and non-performing assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential and other consumer: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-4 single family residential </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer loans\n</td> <td>1,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total residential and other consumer loans </td> <td>28,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family </td> <td>24,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-owner occupied commercial real estate\n</td> <td>64,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and land </td> <td>4,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner occupied commercial real estate </td> <td>23,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial </td> <td>54,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge - franchise finance </td> <td>45,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,631 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge - equipment finance </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial loans </td> <td>215,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-perfoming loans </td> <td>244,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,788 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO and repossessed assets </td> <td>3,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing loans to total loans (1)\n</td> <td>1.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets to total assets (1)\n</td> <td>0.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACL to total loans </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACL to non-performing loans </td> <td>105.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53.07 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs to average loans\n</td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Non-performing loans and assets include the guaranteed portion of non-accrual SBA loans totaling $51.3 million or 0.22% of total loans and 0.15% of total assets, at December 31, 2020; compared to $45.7 million or 0.20% of total loans and 0.14% of total assets, at December 31, 2019.\nThe following chart presents trends in non-performing loans and non-performing assets:\nThe following chart presents trends in non-performing loans by portfolio sub-segment (in millions):\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-performing asset levels may be delayed in the near-term due to government assistance and loan deferral programs.\nContractually delinquent government insured residential loans are excluded from non-performing loans as defined in the table above due to their government guarantee. The carrying value of such loans contractually delinquent by more than 90 days\nwas $562 million and $529 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Increases in the ratios of the ACL to total loans and the ACL to non-performing loans at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 are attributable to the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020 and the impact on the provision for credit losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 of changes in economic conditions, our economic forecast and borrower financial performance related to COVID-19.\nCommercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when (i) management has determined that full repayment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt, or (ii) the loan is past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Residential and consumer loans, other than government insured pool buyout loans, are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income. Commercial loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due principal and interest has been collected and full repayment of remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured. Residential loans are generally returned to accrual status when less than 90 days past due. Past due status of loans is determined based on the contractual next payment due date. Loans less than 30 days past due are reported as current.\nTDRs\nA loan modification is considered a TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise grant. These concessions may take the form of temporarily or permanently reduced interest rates, payment abatement periods, restructuring of payment terms, extensions of maturity at below market terms, or in some cases, partial forgiveness of principal. Included in TDRs are residential loans to borrowers who have not reaffirmed their debt discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nUnder recently issued inter-agency and authoritative guidance and consistent with the CARES Act, short-term (generally periods of six months or less) deferrals or modifications related to COVID-19 will typically not be categorized as TDRs. Additionally, section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act on December 27, 2020, effectively suspended the guidance related to TDRs codified in ASC 310-40 until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or sixty days after the date of the suspension of the declared state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the COVID-19 related deferrals the Company has granted to date that fall under these provisions have not been categorized as TDRs. See the sections entitled \"Asset Quality - Commercial Loans - Payment Deferrals\" and \"Asset Quality - Residential and Other Consumer Loans\" for further discussion.\nThe following table summarizes loans that had been modified in TDRs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Number of TDRs </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Related Specific Allowance </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of TDRs </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized Cost </td> <td> </td> <td>Related Specific Allowance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential and other consumer (1)\n</td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes 326 government insured residential loans modified in TDRs totaling $52.8 million at December 31, 2020; and 346 government insured residential loans modified in TDRs totaling $53.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about TDRs.\nLoss Mitigation Strategies\nCriticized or classified commercial loans in excess of certain thresholds are reviewed quarterly by the Criticized Asset Committee, which evaluates the appropriate strategy for collection to mitigate the amount of credit losses and considers the appropriate risk rating for these loans. Criticized asset reports for each relationship are presented by the assigned relationship manager and credit officer to the Criticized Asset Committee until such time as the relationships are returned to a satisfactory credit risk rating or otherwise resolved. The Criticized Asset Committee may require the transfer of a loan to our workout and recovery department, which is tasked to effectively manage the loan with the goal of minimizing losses and expenses associated with restructure, collection and/or liquidation of collateral. Commercial loans with a risk rating of substandard, loans on non-accrual status, loans modified as TDRs or CARES Act modifications and assets classified as OREO or repossessed assets are usually transferred to workout and recovery. Oversight of the workout and recovery department is provided by the Criticized Asset Committee.\nOur servicers evaluate each residential loan in default to determine the most effective loss mitigation strategy, which may be modification, short sale, or foreclosure, and pursue the alternative most suitable to the consumer and to mitigate losses to the bank. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended new residential foreclosure actions.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential economic impact to our customers, we implemented a short-term program that complies with interagency guidance and the CARES Act under which we have provided temporary relief, and in some cases longer term modifications, on a case by case basis to borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 who were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. See the sections entitled \"Asset Quality - Commercial Loans - Payment Deferrals\" and \"Asset Quality - Residential and Other Consumer Loans\" for further details about COVID-19 related payment deferrals. Under the inter-agency guidance and consistent with the CARES Act, deferrals or modifications related to COVID-19 will generally not be categorized as TDRs. Loans subject to these temporary deferrals or modifications, if in compliance with the contractual terms of the deferral or modification agreements, will typically not be reported as past due or classified as non-accrual during the deferral period.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL is management's estimate of the amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, at the balance sheet date. This estimate encompasses information about historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Determining the amount of the ACL is complex and requires extensive judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain. There remains a high level of uncertainty around the impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on the economy broadly, and on our borrowers specifically. In light of this uncertainty, we believe it is possible that the ACL estimate could change, potentially materially, in future periods. Changes in the ACL may result from changes in current economic conditions, our economic forecast, and in loan portfolio composition, as well as circumstances not currently known to us that may impact the financial condition and operations of our borrowers, among other factors.\nFor the substantial majority of the loan portfolio, expected losses are estimated using econometric models that employ a factor based methodology to estimate PD and LGD, determined based on pool level characteristics. Projected PDs and LGDs are applied to estimated exposure at default to generate estimates of expected loss. Qualitative adjustments may also be applied to incorporate factors that management does not believe have been adequately considered in the quantitative estimate. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans such as collateral dependent loans and TDRs, expected credit losses are estimated on an individual basis. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information about our ACL methodology and related accounting policies.\nThe following table provides an analysis of the ACL, provision for credit losses related to the funded portion of loans and net charge-offs by loan segment for the periods indicated (in thousands). For the years ended December 31, 2020, the ACL was estimated using the CECL methodology. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, an incurred loss methodology was used.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

contributing to the change in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020 are depicted in the chart below (in millions):\nChanges in the ACL upon initial adoption of ASU 2016-13\nASU 2016-13 was adopted effective January 1, 2020, increasing the ACL by $27.3 million. Overall, the change in methodology resulted in increased reserves due to the transition to a lifetime expected loss model from an incurred loss model. However, as noted in the table above, there are certain portfolio segments, most notably CRE, where the reserve decreased. This was mainly driven by the use of quantitative models to estimate the ACL using a methodology tailored more specifically to loans in the Company's portfolio under CECL, instead of the peer group historical loss rates utilized under the prior incurred loss model. Certain qualitative factors were also removed, as their impact was captured in the quantitative estimate under CECL.\nChanges in the ACL subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-13\nThe increase in the ACL from the date of adoption of CECL to December 31, 2020 is a direct result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on current and forecasted economic conditions and on our borrowers specifically, as evidenced in risk rating migration of the portfolio.\nIn the aggregate, the ACL for the CRE portfolio sub-segment, including multi-family, non-owner occupied CRE and construction and land, increased by $88.0 million since the adoption of ASU 2016-13, from 0.22% to 1.52% of loans, and the ACL on the franchise portfolio increased by $27.3 million, from 1.44% of loans to 6.62% of loans. These increases were driven primarily by changes in the economic forecast and risk rating migration reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACL for owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, in the aggregate, increased by $7.4 million since the adoption of ASU 2016-13, while the ACL as a percentage of this segment decreased from 1.12% to 1.07%. This decrease was driven primarily by a larger concentration in loan classes that carry zero or nominal reserves such as PPP and mortgage warehouse loans. The ACL for the residential portfolio segment decreased by $0.5 million since the adoption of ASU 2016-13, from 0.34% to 0.29% of loans in the segment. This decrease was impacted by the increase in government insured residential loans, that carry zero reserves, and updates to certain assumptions.\nThe econometric models we use to estimate expected credit losses ingest a wide array of national, regional and MSA level economic variables and data points. Variables with the most significant impact on the commercial real estate model include unemployment, the CRE property forecast by property type, 10 year treasury yield, Baa corporate yield and real GDP growth. Those with the most significant impact on the commercial model results include a stock market volatility index, the S&P 500 index, unemployment and a variety of interest rates and spreads while those with the most significant impact on the residential model include HPI, unemployment, real GDP growth, and a 30 year mortgage rate.\nSome of the data points informing the reasonable and supportable economic forecast used in estimating the ACL at December 31, 2020 were:\n\u2022National unemployment at 6.7% for the first quarter of 2021, stable through the end of 2021, and declining to 5.4% by the end of 2022;\n\u2022Annualized growth in GDP at 4% for the first quarter of 2021, increasing to 4.1% by the end of 2021, and 4.7% by the end of 2022;\n\u2022VIX trending down to stabilized levels through the forecast horizon; and\n\u2022S&P 500 stable near 3,500 through the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor additional information about the ACL, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDeposits\nA further breakdown of deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is shown below:\nThe total amount of estimated uninsured deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $17.4 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively. Time deposit accounts with balances of $250,000 or more totaled $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Additionally, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about derivative instruments the Company uses to manage interest rate risk.\nCapital Resources\nPursuant to the FDIA, the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tier system for measuring the capital adequacy of the financial institutions they supervise. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, BankUnited and the Company had capital levels that exceeded both the regulatory well-capitalized guidelines and all internal capital ratio targets. The Company has elected the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios.\nWe believe we are well positioned, from a capital perspective, to withstand a severe downturn in the economy. In light of the COVID-19 crisis, uncertainty around its ultimate impact on the economy and, by extension, on our financial condition and results of operations, we have enhanced our stress testing framework. We have increased both the frequency of stress testing and the spectrum of scenarios utilized. One exercise we completed was to stress our March 31, 2020 loan portfolio using both the 2018 DFAST severely adverse scenario and the 2020 DFAST severely adverse scenario. The results of each of these stress tests projected regulatory capital ratios in excess of all well capitalized thresholds.\nWe have an active shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that allows the Company to periodically offer and sell in one or more offerings, individually or in any combination, our common stock, preferred stock and other non-equity securities. The shelf registration provides us with flexibility in issuing capital instruments and enables us to more readily access the capital markets as needed to pursue future growth opportunities and to ensure continued compliance with regulatory capital requirements. Our ability to issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration is subject to market conditions. We demonstrated our ability to successfully access the capital markets during a period of stress when, in the second quarter of 2020, we augmented our regulatory Tier 2 capital with a $300 million issuance of subordinated notes.\nIn 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $101 million, at a weighted average price of $30.36 per share. The Company temporarily suspended the share repurchase program on March 16, 2020; and on January 20, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors reinstated the share repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase up to approximately $44.9 million in shares of its outstanding common stock remained under the share repurchase program at the date of the reinstatement. Any repurchases under the program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in open market or private transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, the economic environment and level of economic uncertainty including as related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's capital position and amount of retained earnings, regulatory requirements, stress testing results, and other considerations. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity involves our ability to generate adequate funds to support planned interest earning asset growth, meet deposit withdrawal and credit line usage requests, maintain reserve requirements, conduct routine operations, pay dividends, service outstanding debt and meet other contractual obligations.\nBankUnited's ongoing liquidity needs have been and continue to be met primarily by cash flows from operations, deposit growth, the investment portfolio and FHLB advances. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was $864 million, $636 million, and $824 million respectively.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to dislocation and volatility in funding and capital markets and evoked widespread concerns about the ongoing functioning of those markets, the availability of liquidity and the economy generally. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate to a target level of 0 - 0.25% and has maintained it at that level to date, actively adjusted the size of its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations, reduced reserve requirements to zero and the cost of discount window borrowings, encouraged banks to utilize the discount window and committed to purchasing large amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and MBS. The U.S. government has announced an unprecedented variety of additional stimulus and measures to support markets, the flow of credit, and systemic liquidity. These include the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Municipal Liquidity Facility, the Main Street New Loan Facility, the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility, Paycheck Protection Program loans, the PPPLF, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. These actions appear to have been effective in stabilizing market liquidity.\nIn response to the onset of COVID-19 and potential concerns that might arise about the stability of liquidity, we initially took a number of precautionary measures to ensure adequacy of liquidity. We took steps to optimize available same day liquidity. We increased the level of cash held on balance sheet, to be prepared to meet potential increased demand for deposit withdrawals and line usage, which to date have not materialized. While we took proactive steps to be prepared for disruptions in liquidity, the COVID-19 pandemic has not been a liquidity event; we have not experienced unusual volatility or stress on our liquidity position to date.\nAvailable liquidity includes cash, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, Federal Funds lines of credit and unpledged agency securities. Additional sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, wholesale deposits, and cash flow from the Bank's amortizing securities and loan portfolios. In the near-term, cash flows from the loan portfolio may be reduced as a result of temporary payment deferrals granted to borrowers. This has not to date and we do not currently expect it to materially impact our liquidity position. Management also has the ability to exert substantial control over the rate and timing of loan production, and resultant requirements for liquidity to fund new loans. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced unusual deposit outflows or volatility; we have, in fact experienced growth in deposits. Credit line usage, which we have monitored regularly since the onset of COVID-19, never significantly exceeded and is currently below our trailing three year average. Our available liquidity may also change as the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank reprice our collateral in the normal course of business based on ongoing quarterly valuations. Based on our internal analysis, we do not expect the impact to be material to our overall liquidity position.\nThe ALCO policy has established several measures of liquidity which are typically monitored monthly by the ALCO and quarterly by the Board of Directors. In light of the COVID-19 situation, we have enhanced the frequency and extent of liquidity monitoring and reporting.\nThe ALCO policy establishes limits for the ratio of available liquidity to volatile liabilities, the ratio of wholesale funding to total assets, the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits and a government backed securities holding ratio, measured as the ratio of U.S. Government backed securities to total securities. At December 31, 2020 BankUnited was in compliance with all of these ALCO policy limits.\nAn additional primary measure of liquidity monitored by management is the 30-day total liquidity ratio, defined as (a) the sum of cash and cash equivalents, pledgeable securities and a measure of funds expected to be generated by operations over the next 30 days; divided by (b) the sum of potential deposit runoff, liabilities maturing within the 30 day time frame and a measure of funds expected to be used in operations over the next 30 days. ALCO policy thresholds stipulate that BankUnited's liquidity is considered acceptable if the 30-day total liquidity ratio exceeds 100%. At December 31, 2020, BankUnited's 30-day total liquidity ratio was 234%. Management also monitors a one-year liquidity ratio, defined as (a) cash and cash equivalents, pledgeable securities, unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB, and loans and non-agency securities maturing within one year; divided by (b) forecasted deposit outflows and borrowings maturing within one year. This ratio allows management to monitor liquidity over a longer time horizon. The acceptable threshold established by the ALCO for this liquidity measure is 100%. At December 31, 2020, BankUnited's one-year liquidity ratio was 312%. Additional measures of liquidity regularly monitored by\nthe ALCO include the ratio of FHLB advances to total funding, concentrations of large deposits, a measure of on balance sheet available liquidity and the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits, which is reflective of the quality and cost, rather than the quantity, of available liquidity. The Company also has a comprehensive contingency liquidity funding plan and conducts a quarterly liquidity stress test, the results of which are reported to the risk committee of the Board of Directors.\nAs a holding company, BankUnited, Inc. is a corporation separate and apart from its banking subsidiary, and therefore, provides for its own liquidity. BankUnited, Inc.'s main sources of funds include management fees and dividends from the Bank, access to capital markets and its own securities portfolio. There are regulatory limitations that may affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to BankUnited, Inc. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing near-term cash obligations.\nWe expect that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied over the next 12 months through the sources of funds described above.\nInterest Rate Risk\nA principal component of the Company's risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, or market risk, is interest rate risk, including the risk that assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree. A primary objective of the Company's asset/liability management activities is to maximize net interest income, while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk. The ALCO is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk, and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with these policies. The thresholds established by the ALCO are approved at least annually by the Board of Directors or its Risk Committee.\nManagement believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of interest rate risk. Income simulation analysis is designed to capture not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice, but also the probability that they will do so. Income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items, and projects their behavior over an extended period of time. Finally, income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates, but also of proposed strategies for responding to them.\nThe income simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over twelve and twenty-four month periods in a most likely rate scenario based on consensus forward interest rate curves versus net interest income in alternative rate scenarios. Management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to changes in the interest rate environment, the economic climate and observed customer behavior. Currently, we are modeling instantaneous rate shocks of plus 100, plus 200, plus 300 and plus 400 basis point shifts as well as a variety of yield curve slope, negative rate and dynamic balance sheet scenarios. We continually evaluate the scenarios being modeled with a view toward adapting them to changing economic conditions, expectations and trends.\nThe Company's ALCO policy provides that net interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if decreases in forecast net interest income in specified parallel rate shock scenarios, generally by policy plus and minus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points, are within specified percentages of forecast net interest income in the most likely rate scenario over the next twelve months and in the second year. At December 31, 2020, the most likely rate scenario assumes that all indices are floored at 0%. We did not apply the falling rate scenarios at December 31, 2020 due to the low level of current interest rates. The following table illustrates the thresholds set forth in the ALCO policy and the impact on forecasted net interest income in the indicated simulated scenarios at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 300 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Thresholds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Model Results at December 31, 2020 - increase:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Model Results at December 31, 2019 - increase (decrease): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In year 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement also simulates changes in EVE in various interest rate environments. The ALCO policy has established parameters of acceptable risk that are defined in terms of the percentage change in EVE from a base scenario under eight rate scenarios, derived by implementing immediate parallel movements of plus and down 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current rates. We did not simulate decreases in interest rates at December 31, 2020 due to the currently low level of market interest rates. The following table illustrates the acceptable thresholds as established by ALCO and the modeled change in EVE in the indicated scenarios at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 300 </td> <td> </td> <td>Plus 400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy Thresholds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Model Results at December 31, 2020 - increase (decrease):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Model Results at December 31, 2019 - decrease: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese measures fall within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the thresholds established in the ALCO policy.\nMany assumptions were used by the Company to calculate the impact of changes in interest rates, including the change in rates. Actual results may not be similar to the Company's projections due to several factors including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions, changes in depositor behavior and loan prepayment speeds and the shape of the yield curve. Actual results may also differ due to the Company's actions, if any, in response to changing rates and conditions.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nInterest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow or fair value hedging instruments are one of the tools we use to manage interest rate risk. These derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to changes in interest cash flows on variable rate borrowings and to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings, in each case caused by fluctuations in benchmark interest rates, as well as to manage duration of liabilities. The fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges is included in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings, as is the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. At December 31, 2020, outstanding interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of $2.9 billion and outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges had an aggregate notional amount of $250 million. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges included in other assets and other liabilities was $0.5 million and $6.0 million respectively.\nInterest rate swaps and caps not designated as hedges had an aggregate notional amount of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps and caps included in other assets was $123.3 million and the aggregate fair value included in other liabilities was $38.5 million. These interest rate swaps and caps were entered into as accommodations to certain of our commercial borrowers. To mitigate interest rate risk associated with these derivatives, the Company enters into offsetting derivative positions with primary dealers.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to our customers, including commitments to fund loans or lines of credit and commercial and standby letters of credit. The credit risk associated with these commitments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and they are subject to our normal credit policies and approval processes. While these commitments represent contractual cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon\nFor more information on commitments, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table contains supplemental information regarding our significant outstanding contractual obligations, including interest to be paid on FHLB advances, long-term borrowings and time deposits, as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Certificates of deposits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,820,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,668,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FHLB Advances </td> <td>3,137,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,033,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> 4.875% Senior Notes due 2025 </td> <td>497,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> 5.125% Senior Notes due 2030 </td> <td>446,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>369,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating lease obligations </td> <td>116,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Finance lease obligations </td> <td>45,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,242,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,095,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>502,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>532,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nPPNR is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is relevant to understanding the performance of the Company attributable to elements other than the provision for credit losses and the ability of the Company to generate earnings sufficient to cover estimated credit losses, particularly in view of the adoption of the CECL accounting methodology, which may impact comparability of operating results to prior periods. This measure also provides a meaningful basis for comparison to other financial institutions and is a measure frequently cited and requested by investors.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of BankUnited, Inc. and its subsidiary (the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\") and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying footnotes and supplemental financial data included herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled \"Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\" We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Response\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governmental authorities implemented a number of measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19 such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activities. While many of these restrictions are beginning to ease and economic activity has started to resume, the pandemic and these precautionary measures have negatively impacted the global and domestic economies, including in the Company's primary market areas. Certain sectors to which the\nCompany has credit exposure, such as travel and hospitality and retail have been particularly impacted. The response of the U.S. Government to the economic impact of the crisis was swift and broad-based. The government has taken a series of actions to support individuals, households and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic including enactment and subsequent extension of the CARES Act. The Federal Reserve also enacted a suite of facilities using its emergency lending powers designed to support liquidity and the flow of credit. Banking regulators reduced reserve requirements and enacted rules designed to support financial institutions in their efforts to work with customers during this time. While development of vaccines and improvements in treatments for the virus are positive signs and economic indicators have shown improvement over the latter half of 2020, there remains a high level of uncertainty about the future trajectory of the virus and its ultimate impact on the economy and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA summary of the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our Company and of our expectations about how our Company may be impacted in the future follows. These matters are discussed in further detail throughout this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations and financial condition at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Deterioration in economic conditions led to a higher provision for credit losses and ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on future credit loss expense and future levels of the ACL, but they may be more volatile and may change materially from current levels. Future levels of the ACL could be significantly impacted, in either direction, by changes in the economic outlook and by the evolving impact of COVID-19 on individual borrowers in the portfolio.\n\u2022Levels of criticized and classified assets have increased, largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact or potential impact on our borrowers. Additionally, a significant number of borrowers requested and were granted relief in the form of temporary payment deferrals or modifications. Risk ratings were re-evaluated for a substantial portion of the commercial portfolio during 2020, with a particular focus on portfolio segments we identified for enhanced monitoring and loans for which we granted temporary payment deferrals or modifications in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, non-performing assets had increased to $247.6 million from $208.7 million at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to predict whether or to what extent levels of non-performing assets and delinquencies will further increase as a result of the pandemic, although they may do so. Similarly, charge-offs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year and may increase further. These impacts may manifest in a delayed fashion due to temporary payment deferrals and modifications and various forms of government assistance that our borrowers may receive.\n\u2022The level of commercial loan origination activity, outside of our participation in the PPP, was lower in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nVolatility in our share price increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020 and in June 2020 we issued $300 million in subordinated debt to strengthen our capital position during this challenging economic environment. In January 2021 our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of our suspended share repurchase program.\nAlthough we took significant measures to prepare for possible disruptions in liquidity, we have not experienced such disruptions to date and continue to have sufficient levels of available liquidity.\nThe pandemic has impacted our operations. Currently, the substantial majority of our non-branch employees are working remotely. We did not experience any significant operational difficulties, technology failures or outages, or customer service disruptions in our transition to a remote work environment. 86% of our branches remain open to serve customers via drive-through or lobby appointments, in some cases operating with reduced hours. Generally, branch locations without drive-through facilities are temporarily closed. We have focused on ensuring that our technology systems and internal controls continue to operate effectively in a remote work environment. We have put mechanisms in place to allow us to evaluate all significant modifications to processes and procedures to insure continued effectiveness of our control environment. We have not identified any instances in which our control environment has failed to operate effectively.\nCustomer demand for our products and services, particularly lending products, has been and may continue to be negatively affected by the impact of the pandemic on their businesses or by social distancing measures. Potential borrowers impacted by the pandemic may no longer meet our underwriting criteria. Loan production in many portfolio segments may continue to be muted, at least over the first half of 2021. While we currently expect loan production to begin to grow by the second half of 2021, our ability to increase production will depend on the future trajectory of the pandemic and on the pace and timing of economic recovery.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have prioritized risk management and implemented a number of measures to support our customers, employees and communities. Specifically, we have:\n\u2022Activated and continue to operate under our business continuity plan under the leadership of executive management.\n\u2022Enhanced liquidity monitoring and management protocols.\n\u2022Maintained a regular cadence of Board of Directors update calls.\n\u2022Enhanced the level and frequency of pro-active outreach to borrowers and our portfolio management activities.\n\u2022Segregated certain segments of the loan portfolio for enhanced monitoring.\n\u2022Enhanced our workout and recovery staffing and processes.\n\u2022Enhanced our stress testing framework. Results of internal stress testing indicate that we have sufficient capital to withstand an increase in credit losses materially beyond levels currently expected, and to withstand a severe downturn.\n\u2022Proactively reached out to our critical third party service providers and evaluated their ability to continue to provide support in the current environment. We have experienced no significant service disruptions.\n\u2022Expanded certain employee benefits and launched a number of programs to keep our employees healthy and engaged.\n\u2022Enhanced personal protective measures for employees working at our corporate locations and begun planning for the eventual return to office of a larger percentage of our workforce, when conditions permit.\n\u2022Supported our clients through participating in the Small Business Administration's PPP, the Federal Reserve's MSLF program and granting payment deferrals, loan modifications and fee waivers on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022Temporarily halted new residential foreclosure actions.\n\u2022Disbursed over 150 grants to nonprofit organizations across our footprint, including an end of year donation of $100,000 to local food banks.\n\u2022Continued helping to meet the various needs of our community partners through over 1,500 employee \"virtual\" volunteer hours during the pandemic.\nWe remain confident in our long-term underlying strength and stability, and our ability to navigate these challenging conditions.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020 for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.\nPerformance Highlights\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we consider the level of and trends in net interest income, the net interest margin, the cost of deposits, levels and composition of non-interest income and non-interest expense, performance ratios such as the return on average equity and return on average assets and asset quality ratios, including the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, non-performing assets to total assets, trends in criticized and classified assets and portfolio delinquency and charge-off trends. We consider growth in earning assets and deposits, particularly non-interest bearing deposits, trends in funding mix and cost of funds. We analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions.\nPerformance highlights include:\n\u2022Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $197.9 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $313.1 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the return on average stockholders' equity was 6.9% and the return on average assets was 0.57%. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the application of CECL, including the impact of COVID-19 on the provision for credit losses.\n\u2022PPNR improved to $427.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $412.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $751.8 million, essentially flat to the prior year. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the ACL was $257 million, or 1.08% of loans compared to $109 million or 0.47% of loans at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss model, of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses and the ACL resulted from the application of the CECL methodology and the impact on expected credit losses of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The average cost of total deposits decreased to 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.63% for 2019. On a spot basis, the average APY on total deposits declined to 0.36% at December 31, 2020 from 1.42% at December 31, 2019. This decline in the cost of deposits reflects both our ongoing strategy to increase non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits and to reduce rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, as well as declines in market interest rates generally.\n\u2022Total deposits increased by $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $2.7 billion or 88% was non-interest bearing demand deposits. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 63% in 2020, to 25% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. The following charts illustrate the composition of deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022Interest earning assets grew by $2.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Loans grew by $711 million; we saw growth in PPP loans and the residential and mortgage warehouse portfolio sub-segments while other portfolio sub-segments declined. Investment securities grew by $1.4 billion as liquidity was deployed into the securities portfolio in a challenging credit environment.\n\u2022Loans on deferral totaled $207 million or less than 1% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Loans modified under the CARES Act totaled $587 million at December 31, 2020. In the aggregate, this represents $794 million or 3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, down from $3.6 billion or 15% of total loans that were granted an initial 90 day deferral as reported at the end of the second quarter. See section entitled \"Asset Quality-Payment Deferrals and Modifications\" for further details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% subordinated notes, augmenting Tier 2 capital.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $101 million, at a weighted average price of $30.36. The Company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program on March 16, 2020. On January 20, 2021, the Company's Board\nof Directors reinstated the share repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase up to approximately $44.9 million in shares of its outstanding common stock remains under the program.\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2020, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by $0.02 to $0.23 per share, reflecting a 10% increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and has maintained that quarterly dividend level throughout 2020.\n\u2022Book value per common share grew to $32.05 at December 31, 2020 from $31.33 at December 31, 2019 while tangible book value per common share increased to $31.22 from $30.52 over the same period.\n\u2022The Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded all regulatory \"well capitalized\" guidelines. The charts below present the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios compared to regulatory guidelines at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nBankUnited, Inc.\nBankUnited, N.A.:\nStrategic Priorities\nManagement has identified the following strategic priorities for our Company:\n\u2022Maximizing risk adjusted returns through a combination of sustainable, diversified and prudently managed organic growth and capital optimization.\n\u2022Growing core deposit relationships.\n\u2022Building a foundational and scalable small business and middle-market franchise.\n\u2022Emphasizing growth in areas where our delivery model is a differentiator.\n\u2022Continuing to execute on our BankUnited 2.0 revenue generating initiatives.\n\u2022Investing in digital capabilities, automation and data analytics.\n\u2022Maintaining an efficient, effective and scalable support model through operational excellence.\n\u2022Monitoring the M&A landscape while growing organically.\nSome of the challenges confronting our Company, which may also impact the banking industry more broadly, include:\n\u2022The current interest rate environment, characterized by generally low interest rates, and relatively tight spreads, may impact our ability to achieve margin expansion.\n\u2022The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis on the economy, our borrowers, our employees and the work environment and demand for our products and services.\n\u2022Regulatory changes and other policy implications that may follow the recent change in the political landscape.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve a heightened level of management judgment due to the complexity, subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nACL\nThe ACL represents management's estimate of current expected credit losses, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, on our loan portfolio and the amount of credit loss impairment on our AFS securities portfolio. Determining the amount of the ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires extensive judgment and estimation. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the ACL include:\n\u2022our evaluation of current conditions;\n\u2022our determination of a reasonable and supportable economic forecast;\n\u2022our evaluation of historical loss experience;\n\u2022our evaluation of changes in composition and characteristic of the loan portfolio, including internal risk ratings;\n\u2022our estimate of expected prepayments;\n\u2022the value of underlying collateral, which may impact loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions for collateral-dependent, criticized and classified loans;\n\u2022our selection and evaluation of qualitative factors;\n\u2022the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from PCD loans; and\n\u2022our estimate of expected cash flows on AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the ACL.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings. Net interest income is impacted by the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources, movements in market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, levels of non-performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors.\nThe mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand, market and competitive conditions in our primary lending markets, by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets and liquidity considerations. The mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by the Company's liquidity profile, management's assessment of the desire for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth expectations, our ability to attract and retain core deposit relationships, competition for deposits in the Company's markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.\nThe following table presents, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of taxable equivalent interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Non-accrual and restructured loans are included in the average balances presented in this table; however, interest income foregone on non-accrual loans is not included. Interest income, yields, spread and margin have been calculated on a tax-equivalent basis for loans and investment securities that are exempt from federal income taxes, at a federal tax rate of 21% (dollars in thousands):\n\n \n(1)On a tax-equivalent basis where applicable. The tax-equivalent adjustment for tax-exempt loans was $14.9 million, $16.7 million, and $17.5 million and the tax-equivalent adjustment for tax-exempt investment securities was $3.1 million, $4.3 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2) At fair value except for securities held to maturity.\nIncreases and decreases in interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in\naverage rate by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume (in thousands):\n\nNet interest income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was $769.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $773.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.0 million. The decrease in net interest income was comprised of decreases in tax-equivalent interest income and in interest expense of $217.3 million and $213.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tax-equivalent interest income was driven primarily by decreases in interest income from loans and investment securities of $119.0 million and $87.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases resulted from declines in market interest rates including the impact of repayment of assets originated in a higher rate environment, partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets. The decline in interest expense on deposits was the largest component of the overall decline in interest expense and reflected decreases in the level of market interest rates as well as the impact of our strategy focused on improving the deposit mix and reducing the rates paid on deposits.\nThe net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline in the yield on interest earning assets outpaced the reduction in cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year.\nOffsetting factors contributing to the decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 included:\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities decreased to 2.25% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted from the impact of purchases of lower-yielding securities, prepayments of higher yielding mortgage-backed securities and decreases in coupon interest rates on existing floating rate assets.\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on loans decreased to 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 4.43% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to this decrease included the decline in benchmark interest rates which impacted the rates earned on both existing floating rate assets and new production, the addition of lower yielding PPP loans, and the runoff of loans originated in a higher rate environment..\n\u2022The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to 1.00% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline reflected continued initiatives taken to lower rates paid on deposits in response to declines in general market interest rates and the re-pricing of term deposits. We expect the cost of interest bearing deposits to continue to decline.\n\u2022The average rate paid on FHLB and PPPLF borrowings declined to 1.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.36% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting declines in market interest rates and the impact of PPPLF borrowings priced at rates lower than the average paid on FHLB advances.\n\u2022The increase in average non-interest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of average total deposits positively impacted the cost of total deposits and the net interest margin.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings required to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost at the balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is impacted by changes in current economic conditions as well as in management's reasonable and supportable economic forecast, loan originations and runoff, changes in portfolio mix, risk rating migration and portfolio seasoning, changes in specific reserves, changes in expected prepayment speeds and other assumptions. The provision for credit losses also includes amounts related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, accrued interest receivable and AFS debt securities.\nThe following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was determined using the CECL methodology and included management's estimate of the expected negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss methodology of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from both the adoption of the CECL methodology and the impact of COVID-19.\nThe evolving COVID-19 situation may lead to increased volatility in the provision for credit losses and if economic conditions or forecasts deteriorate further as a result of COVID-19, the provision for credit losses and the ACL will likely increase.\nThe determination of the amount of the ACL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d below and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the ACL.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents a comparison of the categories of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nDeposit service charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by fee waivers and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19.\nThe increase in gain on sale of GNMA early buyout loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from an increase in the volume of activity.\nThe decrease in gains on guaranteed portions of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was a result of declining origination volume of SBA loans as resources were re-directed to the PPP. The gain on sale of other loans in 2019 was primarily related to a gain on sale of Pinnacle loans totaling $2.4 million.\nThe decrease in income from lease financing for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributed to the increase in operating lease equipment off-lease and re-leasing of assets at lower rates.\nThe most significant factor leading to the decrease in other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was lower revenue from interest rate derivative contracts with our commercial borrowers.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n\n \n(1)Recurring operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure. See section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measurements to their comparable GAAP financial measurements.\nEmployee compensation and benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits declined by $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative. Lower variable compensation costs and the impact of a declining stock price on liability-classified awards also contributed to reduced expense levels.\nOccupancy and equipment\nOccupancy and equipment decreased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases were a result of cost reductions stemming from our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nDeposit insurance expense\nDeposit insurance expense increased by $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in the assessment rate.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees decreased by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the consulting services in 2019 related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nTechnology and telecommunications\nTechnology and telecommunications increased by $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is reflective of investments in digital and data analytics capabilities and in the infrastructure to support cloud migration as well as some costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther non-interest expense\nThe most significant components of other non-interest expense are advertising, promotion and business development, costs related to lending activities, loan servicing and deposit generation, insurance, expenses related to workouts and foreclosures, regulatory examination assessments, travel and general office expense. Decreases are related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative, and in some cases, reduced levels of activity stemming from the COVID pandemic.\nExpenses related directly to COVID-19 for year ended December 31, 2020 included technology and consulting costs related to our participation in the PPP; laptops and other equipment to facilitate employees working remotely; costs related to cleaning, sanitizing and personal protective equipment; other facilities expenses related to preparation for an eventual return of more employees to our offices; and an accrual for rollover vacation days provided to employees.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $51.5 million and $90.9 million, respectively. The Company's effective income tax rate was 20.7% and 22.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about income taxes.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion to $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $31.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by an $833 million increase in the average balance of outstanding loans, related in part to PPP loans originated in 2020. Average interest bearing liabilities declined by $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, while average non-interest bearing deposits increased by $1.8 billion to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTotal deposits increased by $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, while total borrowings declined by $1.0 billion. Investment securities increased by $1.4 billion and total loans increased by $711 million. Investment securities represented 26% of total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019. This is reflective of the deployment of liquidity into the securities portfolio in the challenging lending environment predicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table shows the amortized cost and carrying value, which, with the exception of investment securities held to maturity, is fair value, of investment securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n \n(1)Amortized cost is net of ACL totaling $0.4 million at December 31, 2020.\nOur investment strategy has focused on insuring adequate liquidity, maintaining a suitable balance of high credit quality, diverse assets, managing interest rate risk, and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters. We have sought to maintain liquidity by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities including U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency and sponsored enterprise securities. Investment grade municipal securities provide liquidity and attractive tax-equivalent yields. We have also invested in highly rated structured products, including private-label commercial and residential MBS, collateralized loan obligations, single family rental real estate-backed securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities that, while somewhat less liquid, provide us with attractive yields. Relatively short effective portfolio duration helps mitigate interest rate risk. Based on the Company's assumptions, the estimated weighted average life of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 4.8 years. The effective duration of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 1.5 years. The model results are based on assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nThe investment securities available for sale portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $85.6 million at December 31, 2020, with aggregate fair value equal to 101% of amortized cost. The portfolio has recovered in value from a net realized loss position of $249.8 million at March 31, 2020 that resulted from uncertainty and volatility in the markets immediately following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unrealized losses at March 31, 2020 were primarily concentrated in the CLO and Private Label CMBS asset classes. Net unrealized gains at December 31, 2020 included $117.1 million of gross unrealized gains and $31.4 million of gross unrealized losses. Investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020 had an aggregate fair value of $3.3 billion. The majority of the unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 related to the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments. The ratings distribution of our AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 is depicted in the chart below:\nWe evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investments in unrealized loss positions. This evaluation considers, but is not necessarily limited to, the following factors, the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security:\n\u2022Whether we intend to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022Whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022The extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost;\n\u2022Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area;\n\u2022Changes in the financial condition of the issuer or underlying loan obligors;\n\u2022The payment structure and remaining payment terms of the security, including levels of subordination or over-collateralization;\n\u2022Failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments;\n\u2022Changes in credit ratings;\n\u2022Relevant market data;\n\u2022Estimated prepayments, defaults, and the value and performance of underlying collateral at the individual security level.\nAn ACL of $0.4 million was recorded related to one private label CMBS security during the year ended December 31, 2020. This security is not projected to sustain credit losses and management does not intend to sell the security at the balance sheet date. However, due to negative underlying collateral performance trends the security is being closely monitored and management may determine not to hold the security until full recovery of its amortized cost basis. No securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not intend to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions at December 31, 2020. Based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nThe timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government. As such, there is an assumption of zero credit loss and the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.\nNone of our private label securities in unrealized loss positions had missed principal or interest payments or had been downgraded by a NRSRO at December 31, 2020. The Company performed an analysis comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of impaired securities. This analysis was based on a scenario that we believe to be generally more severe than our reasonable and supportable economic forecast at December 31, 2020, and incorporated assumptions about voluntary prepayment rates, collateral defaults, delinquencies, severity and other relevant factors. Our analysis also considered the structural characteristics of each security and the level of credit enhancement provided by that structure. Based on the results of this analysis, none of the private label AFS securities in unrealized loss positions were projected to sustain credit losses at December 31, 2020. Further information about the portfolio segments evidencing the largest unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments, follows.\nFor private label CMBS, our analysis of cash", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of BankUnited, Inc. and its subsidiary (the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\") and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying footnotes and supplemental financial data included herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled \"Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\" We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Response\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governmental authorities implemented a number of measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19 such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activities. While many of these restrictions are beginning to ease and economic activity has started to resume, the pandemic and these precautionary measures have negatively impacted the global and domestic economies, including in the Company's primary market areas. Certain sectors to which the\nCompany has credit exposure, such as travel and hospitality and retail have been particularly impacted. The response of the U.S. Government to the economic impact of the crisis was swift and broad-based. The government has taken a series of actions to support individuals, households and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic including enactment and subsequent extension of the CARES Act. The Federal Reserve also enacted a suite of facilities using its emergency lending powers designed to support liquidity and the flow of credit. Banking regulators reduced reserve requirements and enacted rules designed to support financial institutions in their efforts to work with customers during this time. While development of vaccines and improvements in treatments for the virus are positive signs and economic indicators have shown improvement over the latter half of 2020, there remains a high level of uncertainty about the future trajectory of the virus and its ultimate impact on the economy and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA summary of the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our Company and of our expectations about how our Company may be impacted in the future follows. These matters are discussed in further detail throughout this Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations and financial condition at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Deterioration in economic conditions led to a higher provision for credit losses and ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on future credit loss expense and future levels of the ACL, but they may be more volatile and may change materially from current levels. Future levels of the ACL could be significantly impacted, in either direction, by changes in the economic outlook and by the evolving impact of COVID-19 on individual borrowers in the portfolio.\n\u2022Levels of criticized and classified assets have increased, largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact or potential impact on our borrowers. Additionally, a significant number of borrowers requested and were granted relief in the form of temporary payment deferrals or modifications. Risk ratings were re-evaluated for a substantial portion of the commercial portfolio during 2020, with a particular focus on portfolio segments we identified for enhanced monitoring and loans for which we granted temporary payment deferrals or modifications in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, non-performing assets had increased to $247.6 million from $208.7 million at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to predict whether or to what extent levels of non-performing assets and delinquencies will further increase as a result of the pandemic, although they may do so. Similarly, charge-offs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year and may increase further. These impacts may manifest in a delayed fashion due to temporary payment deferrals and modifications and various forms of government assistance that our borrowers may receive.\n\u2022The level of commercial loan origination activity, outside of our participation in the PPP, was lower in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nVolatility in our share price increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020 and in June 2020 we issued $300 million in subordinated debt to strengthen our capital position during this challenging economic environment. In January 2021 our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of our suspended share repurchase program.\nAlthough we took significant measures to prepare for possible disruptions in liquidity, we have not experienced such disruptions to date and continue to have sufficient levels of available liquidity.\nThe pandemic has impacted our operations. Currently, the substantial majority of our non-branch employees are working remotely. We did not experience any significant operational difficulties, technology failures or outages, or customer service disruptions in our transition to a remote work environment. 86% of our branches remain open to serve customers via drive-through or lobby appointments, in some cases operating with reduced hours. Generally, branch locations without drive-through facilities are temporarily closed. We have focused on ensuring that our technology systems and internal controls continue to operate effectively in a remote work environment. We have put mechanisms in place to allow us to evaluate all significant modifications to processes and procedures to insure continued effectiveness of our control environment. We have not identified any instances in which our control environment has failed to operate effectively.\nCustomer demand for our products and services, particularly lending products, has been and may continue to be negatively affected by the impact of the pandemic on their businesses or by social distancing measures. Potential borrowers impacted by the pandemic may no longer meet our underwriting criteria. Loan production in many portfolio segments may continue to be muted, at least over the first half of 2021. While we currently expect loan production to begin to grow by the second half of 2021, our ability to increase production will depend on the future trajectory of the pandemic and on the pace and timing of economic recovery.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have prioritized risk management and implemented a number of measures to support our customers, employees and communities. Specifically, we have:\n\u2022Activated and continue to operate under our business continuity plan under the leadership of executive management.\n\u2022Enhanced liquidity monitoring and management protocols.\n\u2022Maintained a regular cadence of Board of Directors update calls.\n\u2022Enhanced the level and frequency of pro-active outreach to borrowers and our portfolio management activities.\n\u2022Segregated certain segments of the loan portfolio for enhanced monitoring.\n\u2022Enhanced our workout and recovery staffing and processes.\n\u2022Enhanced our stress testing framework. Results of internal stress testing indicate that we have sufficient capital to withstand an increase in credit losses materially beyond levels currently expected, and to withstand a severe downturn.\n\u2022Proactively reached out to our critical third party service providers and evaluated their ability to continue to provide support in the current environment. We have experienced no significant service disruptions.\n\u2022Expanded certain employee benefits and launched a number of programs to keep our employees healthy and engaged.\n\u2022Enhanced personal protective measures for employees working at our corporate locations and begun planning for the eventual return to office of a larger percentage of our workforce, when conditions permit.\n\u2022Supported our clients through participating in the Small Business Administration's PPP, the Federal Reserve's MSLF program and granting payment deferrals, loan modifications and fee waivers on a case-by-case basis.\n\u2022Temporarily halted new residential foreclosure actions.\n\u2022Disbursed over 150 grants to nonprofit organizations across our footprint, including an end of year donation of $100,000 to local food banks.\n\u2022Continued helping to meet the various needs of our community partners through over 1,500 employee \"virtual\" volunteer hours during the pandemic.\nWe remain confident in our long-term underlying strength and stability, and our ability to navigate these challenging conditions.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020 for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.\nPerformance Highlights\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we consider the level of and trends in net interest income, the net interest margin, the cost of deposits, levels and composition of non-interest income and non-interest expense, performance ratios such as the return on average equity and return on average assets and asset quality ratios, including the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans, non-performing assets to total assets, trends in criticized and classified assets and portfolio delinquency and charge-off trends. We consider growth in earning assets and deposits, particularly non-interest bearing deposits, trends in funding mix and cost of funds. We analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions.\nPerformance highlights include:\n\u2022Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $197.9 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $313.1 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the return on average stockholders' equity was 6.9% and the return on average assets was 0.57%. Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the application of CECL, including the impact of COVID-19 on the provision for credit losses.\n\u2022PPNR improved to $427.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $412.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $751.8 million, essentially flat to the prior year. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $178.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the ACL was $257 million, or 1.08% of loans compared to $109 million or 0.47% of loans at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss model, of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses and the ACL resulted from the application of the CECL methodology and the impact on expected credit losses of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The average cost of total deposits decreased to 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.63% for 2019. On a spot basis, the average APY on total deposits declined to 0.36% at December 31, 2020 from 1.42% at December 31, 2019. This decline in the cost of deposits reflects both our ongoing strategy to increase non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits and to reduce rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, as well as declines in market interest rates generally.\n\u2022Total deposits increased by $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $2.7 billion or 88% was non-interest bearing demand deposits. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 63% in 2020, to 25% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. The following charts illustrate the composition of deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022Interest earning assets grew by $2.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Loans grew by $711 million; we saw growth in PPP loans and the residential and mortgage warehouse portfolio sub-segments while other portfolio sub-segments declined. Investment securities grew by $1.4 billion as liquidity was deployed into the securities portfolio in a challenging credit environment.\n\u2022Loans on deferral totaled $207 million or less than 1% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Loans modified under the CARES Act totaled $587 million at December 31, 2020. In the aggregate, this represents $794 million or 3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, down from $3.6 billion or 15% of total loans that were granted an initial 90 day deferral as reported at the end of the second quarter. See section entitled \"Asset Quality-Payment Deferrals and Modifications\" for further details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% subordinated notes, augmenting Tier 2 capital.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $101 million, at a weighted average price of $30.36. The Company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program on March 16, 2020. On January 20, 2021, the Company's Board\nof Directors reinstated the share repurchase program. Authorization to repurchase up to approximately $44.9 million in shares of its outstanding common stock remains under the program.\n\u2022In the first quarter of 2020, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by $0.02 to $0.23 per share, reflecting a 10% increase from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and has maintained that quarterly dividend level throughout 2020.\n\u2022Book value per common share grew to $32.05 at December 31, 2020 from $31.33 at December 31, 2019 while tangible book value per common share increased to $31.22 from $30.52 over the same period.\n\u2022The Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded all regulatory \"well capitalized\" guidelines. The charts below present the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios compared to regulatory guidelines at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nBankUnited, Inc.\nBankUnited, N.A.:\nStrategic Priorities\nManagement has identified the following strategic priorities for our Company:\n\u2022Maximizing risk adjusted returns through a combination of sustainable, diversified and prudently managed organic growth and capital optimization.\n\u2022Growing core deposit relationships.\n\u2022Building a foundational and scalable small business and middle-market franchise.\n\u2022Emphasizing growth in areas where our delivery model is a differentiator.\n\u2022Continuing to execute on our BankUnited 2.0 revenue generating initiatives.\n\u2022Investing in digital capabilities, automation and data analytics.\n\u2022Maintaining an efficient, effective and scalable support model through operational excellence.\n\u2022Monitoring the M&A landscape while growing organically.\nSome of the challenges confronting our Company, which may also impact the banking industry more broadly, include:\n\u2022The current interest rate environment, characterized by generally low interest rates, and relatively tight spreads, may impact our ability to achieve margin expansion.\n\u2022The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis on the economy, our borrowers, our employees and the work environment and demand for our products and services.\n\u2022Regulatory changes and other policy implications that may follow the recent change in the political landscape.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAccounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve a heightened level of management judgment due to the complexity, subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nACL\nThe ACL represents management's estimate of current expected credit losses, or the amount of amortized cost basis not expected to be collected, on our loan portfolio and the amount of credit loss impairment on our AFS securities portfolio. Determining the amount of the ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires extensive judgment and estimation. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the ACL include:\n\u2022our evaluation of current conditions;\n\u2022our determination of a reasonable and supportable economic forecast;\n\u2022our evaluation of historical loss experience;\n\u2022our evaluation of changes in composition and characteristic of the loan portfolio, including internal risk ratings;\n\u2022our estimate of expected prepayments;\n\u2022the value of underlying collateral, which may impact loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions for collateral-dependent, criticized and classified loans;\n\u2022our selection and evaluation of qualitative factors;\n\u2022the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from PCD loans; and\n\u2022our estimate of expected cash flows on AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions.\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the ACL.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings. Net interest income is impacted by the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources, movements in market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, levels of non-performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors.\nThe mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand, market and competitive conditions in our primary lending markets, by management's continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets and liquidity considerations. The mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by the Company's liquidity profile, management's assessment of the desire for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth expectations, our ability to attract and retain core deposit relationships, competition for deposits in the Company's markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds.\nThe following table presents, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of taxable equivalent interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Non-accrual and restructured loans are included in the average balances presented in this table; however, interest income foregone on non-accrual loans is not included. Interest income, yields, spread and margin have been calculated on a tax-equivalent basis for loans and investment securities that are exempt from federal income taxes, at a federal tax rate of 21% (dollars in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

income, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was $769.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $773.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.0 million. The decrease in net interest income was comprised of decreases in tax-equivalent interest income and in interest expense of $217.3 million and $213.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in tax-equivalent interest income was driven primarily by decreases in interest income from loans and investment securities of $119.0 million and $87.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases resulted from declines in market interest rates including the impact of repayment of assets originated in a higher rate environment, partially offset by increases in average interest earning assets. The decline in interest expense on deposits was the largest component of the overall decline in interest expense and reflected decreases in the level of market interest rates as well as the impact of our strategy focused on improving the deposit mix and reducing the rates paid on deposits.\nThe net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline in the yield on interest earning assets outpaced the reduction in cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year.\nOffsetting factors contributing to the decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 included:\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities decreased to 2.25% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted from the impact of purchases of lower-yielding securities, prepayments of higher yielding mortgage-backed securities and decreases in coupon interest rates on existing floating rate assets.\n\u2022The tax-equivalent yield on loans decreased to 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 4.43% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Factors contributing to this decrease included the decline in benchmark interest rates which impacted the rates earned on both existing floating rate assets and new production, the addition of lower yielding PPP loans, and the runoff of loans originated in a higher rate environment..\n\u2022The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to 1.00% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline reflected continued initiatives taken to lower rates paid on deposits in response to declines in general market interest rates and the re-pricing of term deposits. We expect the cost of interest bearing deposits to continue to decline.\n\u2022The average rate paid on FHLB and PPPLF borrowings declined to 1.99% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.36% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting declines in market interest rates and the impact of PPPLF borrowings priced at rates lower than the average paid on FHLB advances.\n\u2022The increase in average non-interest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of average total deposits positively impacted the cost of total deposits and the net interest margin.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is a charge to earnings required to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost at the balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is impacted by changes in current economic conditions as well as in management's reasonable and supportable economic forecast, loan originations and runoff, changes in portfolio mix, risk rating migration and portfolio seasoning, changes in specific reserves, changes in expected prepayment speeds and other assumptions. The provision for credit losses also includes amounts related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, accrued interest receivable and AFS debt securities.\nThe following table presents the components of the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to funded portion of loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to off-balance sheet credit exposures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,572) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount related to accrued interest receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for credit losses - AFS debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total provision for credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,431 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was determined using the CECL methodology and included management's estimate of the expected negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses, under the incurred loss methodology of $8.9 million. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from both the adoption of the CECL methodology and the impact of COVID-19.\nThe evolving COVID-19 situation may lead to increased volatility in the provision for credit losses and if economic conditions or forecasts deteriorate further as a result of COVID-19, the provision for credit losses and the ACL will likely increase.\nThe determination of the amount of the ACL is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d below and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the ACL.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table presents a comparison of the categories of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit service charges and fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,412 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of covered loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed portions of SBA loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GNMA early buyout loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of loans, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on investment securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains on sale of securities AFS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,944) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on investment securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposit service charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by fee waivers and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19.\nThe increase in gain on sale of GNMA early buyout loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from an increase in the volume of activity.\nThe decrease in gains on guaranteed portions of SBA loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 was a result of declining origination volume of SBA loans as resources were re-directed to the PPP. The gain on sale of other loans in 2019 was primarily related to a gain on sale of Pinnacle loans totaling $2.4 million.\nThe decrease in income from lease financing for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributed to the increase in operating lease equipment off-lease and re-leasing of assets at lower rates.\nThe most significant factor leading to the decrease in other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was lower revenue from interest rate derivative contracts with our commercial borrowers.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FDIC indemnification asset </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>261,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and telecommunications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,136 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of operating lease equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>457,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>487,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740,540 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of FDIC indemnification </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(261,763) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of operating lease equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,493) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,025) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,796) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs incurred directly related to implementation of BankUnited 2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,802) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,899) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,758) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring operating expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>419,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>436,853 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1)Recurring operating expenses is a non-GAAP measure. See section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measurements to their comparable GAAP financial measurements.\nEmployee compensation and benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits declined by $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative. Lower variable compensation costs and the impact of a declining stock price on liability-classified awards also contributed to reduced expense levels.\nOccupancy and equipment\nOccupancy and equipment decreased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decreases were a result of cost reductions stemming from our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nDeposit insurance expense\nDeposit insurance expense increased by $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in the assessment rate.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees decreased by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the consulting services in 2019 related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative.\nTechnology and telecommunications\nTechnology and telecommunications increased by $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is reflective of investments in digital and data analytics capabilities and in the infrastructure to support cloud migration as well as some costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther non-interest expense\nThe most significant components of other non-interest expense are advertising, promotion and business development, costs related to lending activities, loan servicing and deposit generation, insurance, expenses related to workouts and foreclosures, regulatory examination assessments, travel and general office expense. Decreases are related to our BankUnited 2.0 initiative, and in some cases, reduced levels of activity stemming from the COVID pandemic.\nExpenses related directly to COVID-19 for year ended December 31, 2020 included technology and consulting costs related to our participation in the PPP; laptops and other equipment to facilitate employees working remotely; costs related to cleaning, sanitizing and personal protective equipment; other facilities expenses related to preparation for an eventual return of more employees to our offices; and an accrual for rollover vacation days provided to employees.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $51.5 million and $90.9 million, respectively. The Company's effective income tax rate was 20.7% and 22.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about income taxes.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $1.5 billion to $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $31.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by an $833 million increase in the average balance of outstanding loans, related in part to PPP loans originated in 2020. Average interest bearing liabilities declined by $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, while average non-interest bearing deposits increased by $1.8 billion to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTotal deposits increased by $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, while total borrowings declined by $1.0 billion. Investment securities increased by $1.4 billion and total loans increased by $711 million. Investment securities represented 26% of total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019. This is reflective of the deployment of liquidity into the securities portfolio in the challenging lending environment predicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvestment Securities\nThe following table

ACL totaling $0.4 million at December 31, 2020.\nOur investment strategy has focused on insuring adequate liquidity, maintaining a suitable balance of high credit quality, diverse assets, managing interest rate risk, and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters. We have sought to maintain liquidity by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities including U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency and sponsored enterprise securities. Investment grade municipal securities provide liquidity and attractive tax-equivalent yields. We have also invested in highly rated structured products, including private-label commercial and residential MBS, collateralized loan obligations, single family rental real estate-backed securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities that, while somewhat less liquid, provide us with attractive yields. Relatively short effective portfolio duration helps mitigate interest rate risk. Based on the Company's assumptions, the estimated weighted average life of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 4.8 years. The effective duration of the investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 1.5 years. The model results are based on assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nThe investment securities available for sale portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $85.6 million at December 31, 2020, with aggregate fair value equal to 101% of amortized cost. The portfolio has recovered in value from a net realized loss position of $249.8 million at March 31, 2020 that resulted from uncertainty and volatility in the markets immediately following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unrealized losses at March 31, 2020 were primarily concentrated in the CLO and Private Label CMBS asset classes. Net unrealized gains at December 31, 2020 included $117.1 million of gross unrealized gains and $31.4 million of gross unrealized losses. Investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020 had an aggregate fair value of $3.3 billion. The majority of the unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 related to the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments. The ratings distribution of our AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 is depicted in the chart below:\nWe evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investments in unrealized loss positions. This evaluation considers, but is not necessarily limited to, the following factors, the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security:\n\u2022Whether we intend to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022Whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n\u2022The extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost;\n\u2022Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area;\n\u2022Changes in the financial condition of the issuer or underlying loan obligors;\n\u2022The payment structure and remaining payment terms of the security, including levels of subordination or over-collateralization;\n\u2022Failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments;\n\u2022Changes in credit ratings;\n\u2022Relevant market data;\n\u2022Estimated prepayments, defaults, and the value and performance of underlying collateral at the individual security level.\nAn ACL of $0.4 million was recorded related to one private label CMBS security during the year ended December 31, 2020. This security is not projected to sustain credit losses and management does not intend to sell the security at the balance sheet date. However, due to negative underlying collateral performance trends the security is being closely monitored and management may determine not to hold the security until full recovery of its amortized cost basis. No securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not intend to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions at December 31, 2020. Based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nThe timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government. As such, there is an assumption of zero credit loss and the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.\nNone of our private label securities in unrealized loss positions had missed principal or interest payments or had been downgraded by a NRSRO at December 31, 2020. The Company performed an analysis comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of impaired securities. This analysis was based on a scenario that we believe to be generally more severe than our reasonable and supportable economic forecast at December 31, 2020, and incorporated assumptions about voluntary prepayment rates, collateral defaults, delinquencies, severity and other relevant factors. Our analysis also considered the structural characteristics of each security and the level of credit enhancement provided by that structure. Based on the results of this analysis, none of the private label AFS securities in unrealized loss positions were projected to sustain credit losses at December 31, 2020. Further information about the portfolio segments evidencing the largest unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, the private label CMBS and CLO portfolio segments, follows.\nFor private label CMBS, our analysis of cash"}
