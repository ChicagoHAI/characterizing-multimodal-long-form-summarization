Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe (the Company\u201d or NCC\u201d) are a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d or the Bank\u201d). Through NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama, twenty-two full-service banking offices in central and northeast Florida, and two full-service banking offices in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. Certain of our offices operate under trade names, including United Legacy Bank,\u201d Reunion Bank of Florida,\u201d Patriot Bank\u201d and FirstAtlantic Bank\u201d in Florida, and Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage\u201d in Georgia.\nWe also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing LLC ( Corporate Billing\u201d), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2018 Acquisition\nFirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc. ( FirstAtlantic\u201d), a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, through the merger of FirstAtlantic with and into NCC and of FirstAtlantic's wholly-owned subsidiary, FirstAtlantic Bank, with and into NBC. The former offices of FirstAtlantic Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name FirstAtlantic Bank.\u201d Because the acquisition was completed after year-end, the assets, liabilities and results of operations for FirstAtlantic were not included in our financial results for 2017, but they will be included in our financial results for 2018.\nIn connection with the merger, each share of FirstAtlantic common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.44 shares of our common stock or $17.25 in cash. We paid approximately $12.8 million in cash and issued 2,393,389 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $110.0 million.\nWe marked FirstAtlantic's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $489.4 million in assets at fair value from FirstAtlantic and added eight banking centers with approximately $303.9 million in loans and approximately $374.3 million in deposits. We expect to record goodwill of approximately $50.5 million and a core deposit intangible asset of approximately $6.3 million as a result of the merger. The fair value results are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing as additional information becomes available.\nAdditional information regarding the FirstAtlantic merger is included in Note 20, Subsequent Events,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\n2017 Acquisitions\nPatriot Bank\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired Patriot Bank, headquartered in Trinity, Florida, through the merger of Patriot Bank with and into NBC. The former offices of Patriot Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Patriot Bank.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Patriot Bank common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.1711 shares of NCC common stock and $0.725 in cash. We paid approximately $3.0 million in cash and issued 706,702 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $31.1 million.\nWe marked Patriot Bank's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $160.3 million in assets at fair value from Patriot Bank and added four banking centers with approximately $121.7 million in loans and approximately $127.7 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $14.7 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $899 thousand as a result of the merger.\nPrivate Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2017, we acquired Private Bancshares, Inc. ( Private Bancshares\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, through the merger of Private Bancshares with and into NCC and of Private Bancshares' wholly-owned subsidiary, Private Bank of Buckhead, with and into NBC. The former offices of Private Bank of Buckhead continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade names Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Private Bancshares common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.85417 shares of our common stock or $20.50 in cash. We paid approximately $8.3 million in cash and issued 1,809,189 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $79.9 million.\nWe marked Private Bancshares' assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $371.1 million in assets at fair value from Private Bancshares and added two banking centers with approximately $260.0 million in loans and approximately $286.2 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $47.9 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $3.0 million as a result of the merger.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d), headquartered in Tavares, Florida, through the merger of Reunion with and into NBC. The former offices of Reunion continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Reunion common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.7273 shares of our common stock or $16.00 in cash. We paid approximately $7.4 million in cash and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Patriot Bank, Private Bancshares and Reunion acquisitions is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2017 Results\nOur net income was $20.1 million in 2017, compared to $17.9 million in 2016, after taking into account a write-down of our deferred tax asset ( DTA\u201d) due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, increasing income tax expense for the year by $6.2 million. The primary factors leading to the increase in our 2017 net income and other highlights include the following:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We acquired Private Bancshares on January 1, 2017 and Patriot Bank on August 31, 2017.

In addition to organic growth, 2017 balances include a full year of loans attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of loans attributable to Patriot Bank.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Loan yields in 2017 averaged 5.40%, compared to 5.06% for 2016.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $396.9 million in 2016 to $621.8 million in 2017, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of higher loan yields, relatively stable funding costs and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 4.12% in 2016 to 4.42% in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Average deposits in 2017 were $2.08 billion, compared to $1.52 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 36.7%.

The net proceeds to the Company after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses totaled $38.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses that we ultimately realize may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings. Management performed its quarterly analysis as of December 31, 2017 and concluded that no securities were impaired. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (1) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (2) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefits, and (3) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows related to the loans will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income.\nIn determining the initial fair value of purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration at the date of acquisition, we include an adjustment to reflect an appropriate market rate of interest given the risk profile and grade assigned to each loan. This adjustment is accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment, using the effective yield method, over the remaining life of each loan.\nWe record goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, we are required to allocate the consideration paid for an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual test of impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur other intangible assets consist of core deposit premiums acquired in connection with business combinations and are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the consummation date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of three to ten years. Amortization periods are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill and other intangibles for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income\n2017 vs. 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our net income was $20.1 million, compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12.4%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $24.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 and the $6.2 million write-down of our DTA due to the lower corporate tax rate implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2017 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2017, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $11.5 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 65.3%. Other noninterest expense increased by $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Each category of noninterest expense increased in large part as a result of a full year of activity from Private Bancshares, which we acquired on January 1, 2017, and four months of activity from Patriot Bank, which we acquired on August 31, 2017. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with our acquisition activities also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank, which we acquired on January 1, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively. The following table details the amounts that Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Private\nBancshares\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Patriot\nBank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income was $17.9 million, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 85.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $8.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2016 was in revenue from the mortgage division and merchant sponsorship revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2016, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $7.0 million, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 32.2%. Merchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We entered this business during April 2015, so 2016 was the first year to include this category of revenue for a full twelve-month period. Other noninterest expense increased by $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with being a public company for a full year also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that Reunion contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our 2015 results include two months of activity attributable to Reunion.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET

<td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Net Interest Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet interest income increased by $32.2 million, or 48.0%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $67.2 million for 2016. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $35.2 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume, investment securities and cash balances in banks, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 37.3% increase in average loans outstanding, a 13.6% increase in average investment securities and a 67.8% increase in average cash balances in other banks during 2017 compared to 2016. The resulting net interest margin for 2017 rose to 4.42%, from 4.12% during 2016. Higher loan yields during 2017, coupled with higher rates earned on cash balances in other banks, also contributed to the increased net interest margin during 2017. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $621.8 million, compared to $396.9 million during 2016, an increase of $224.9 million, or 56.7%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $2.25 billion for 2017, compared to $1.63 billion for 2016, an increase of $620.8 million, or 38.1%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.30% to 4.90% during 2017, compared to 4.60% for 2016. During 2017, loan yields increased by 0.34% to 5.40%. The increase in loan yield was primarily attributable to recent increases in short-term interest rate indices, such as the prime rate and 30-day LIBOR, increased accretion on our acquired loan portfolios due to early pay-offs and higher rates on loans acquired from Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average loan balances of $276.4 million and $42.6 million, respectively, during 2017.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.49 billion for 2017, compared to $1.14 billion for 2016, an increase of $341.1 million, or 29.8%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.70% for 2017, compared to 0.64% for 2016. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases. The rate increase on deposit accounts was primarily due to the effect of increases in short-term rate indices, such as the prime rate, and some resultant competitive pricing pressure in certain account types, as well as the fact that rates paid on Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's interest-bearing deposits were generally higher than the rates paid on our other deposits. The increase in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing average deposits was due to organic deposit production and the inclusion of Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's deposits in our results during 2017. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average deposit balances of $304.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, during 2017.\nComparison of Net Interest Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet interest income increased by $17.1 million, or 34.2%, to $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50.0 million for 2015. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $19.7 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and investment securities, which was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 38.1% increase in average loans outstanding and a 96.6% increase in average investment securities during 2016 compared to 2015. The resulting net interest margin for 2016 rose to 4.12%, from 4.10% during 2015. Despite lower loan yields during 2016, the net interest margin in 2016 increased due to a change in our earning asset mix. During 2016, a larger percentage of our earning assets was invested in loans and investment securities, and we experienced a decrease in cash balances in other banks, our lowest-yielding asset. This change in earning asset mix, along with higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, contributed to our increased net interest margin during 2016. During 2016, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $396.9 million, compared to $269.0 million during 2015, an increase of $127.9 million, or 47.6%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $1.63 billion for 2016, compared to $1.22 billion for 2015, an increase of $410.5 million, or 33.7%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.08% to 4.60% during 2016, compared to 4.52% for 2015. The yield on interest-earning assets increased despite a decreased yield on loans during 2016. During 2016, loan yields decreased by 0.11% to 5.06%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily attributable to the fact that rates on maturing loans generally have been higher than rates on new or renewed loans and that factored receivables, which earn a higher yield than traditional loans, represented a lower proportion of our total loans in 2016.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.14 billion for 2016, compared to $877.1 million for 2015, an increase of $267.5 million, or 30.5%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.64% for 2016, compared to 0.55% for 2015. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases, with the exception of interest-bearing transaction accounts, which experienced a slight rate decrease. The rate increase on deposit accounts was due to the effect of rate increases that occurred in late 2016 and the impact of the inherited deposits of Reunion. The Reunion deposits generally had higher rates than our existing deposits. Our subordinated debt issuance in May 2016 also contributed to the increased interest-bearing liability costs for 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and 0.09% increase in the rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased our total interest expense by $2.6 million in 2016 to $7.4 million.\nThe following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates paid or earned on these assets and liabilities.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

31, 2016 and $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The provision for 2017 was a result of overall loan growth rather than declining asset quality metrics, and we incurred net charge-offs of $995 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required additional provision expense during 2017. The provision expense for 2016 was primarily attributable to growth in our overall loan portfolio, specifically our real estate-mortgage\u201d portfolio and the impact of uncertainty in the national and international economies on our local markets. We also incurred net charge-offs of $923 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required provision expense during 2016. The provision expense for 2015 was primarily related to the real estate-mortgage\u201d and construction\u201d portfolios.\nOur policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses (which is a charge to earnings) and loan recoveries, and is decreased by charge-offs. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated and an impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount generally is charged off. As of December 31, 2017, $9 thousand of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. Our mortgage division generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, NBC owns life insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. NBC also earns revenue as a sponsor bank for a provider of electronic transaction processing services for retail merchants and the consumer finance industry. This sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard networks allows the processor to accept debit and credit card transactions, and we earn a fee on each such transaction.\nAdditionally, during the 2017 third quarter, we purchased a building in Birmingham, Alabama that will serve as our corporate headquarters and replace our current leased location. We are renovating the portion of the building that we intend to occupy, and we intend to lease the remaining space to unrelated third parties. During the third quarter of 2017, we began to receive rental income related to this activity and recorded $324 thousand in rental income for the full year.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> NONINTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage origination and fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant sponsorship revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on sale of other real estate, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of investments available-for-sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>570 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $20.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. Each category of noninterest income (except for wealth management fees) increased during 2017. The inclusion of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank in our results of operations accounted for $4.4 million of the $6.1 million increase in noninterest income recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMortgage division income increased by $4.6 million during 2017 and totaled $11.5 million for the year, compared to $7.0 million during 2016. Mortgage division production totaled $507.6 million during 2016, compared to $322.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2017, refinance activity accounted for approximately 24.3% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. A large portion of this increase was due to the acquisition of Private Bancshares, which had a sizable mortgage operation that we acquired through the transaction.\nMerchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to growth in the volume of transactions that we processed.\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $692 thousand to $2.7 million for 2017. The addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed $272 thousand of the increase for 2017. The remaining portion of this increase was a result of an increase in the number of deposit accounts, as we continue to open new accounts and gain market share in our markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income from bank-owned life insurance totaling $855 thousand, compared to $810 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during 2017 was due to the addition of the bank-owned life insurance acquired in the Private Bancshares transaction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded gains on the sale of other real estate totaling $44 thousand, compared to a gain of $244 thousand on such sales during 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $365 thousand and totaled $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Most of the increase was attributable to non-recurring income, such as a death benefit claim and refunds on unemployment taxes.\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $14.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income was higher revenue from the mortgage division in 2016. Mortgage division income increased by $1.7 million during 2016 and totaled $7.0 million for the year, compared to $5.3 million during 2015. Mortgage division production totaled $322.9 million during 2016, compared to $281.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, refinance activity accounted for approximately 22.2% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. The increased volume during 2016 was a result of our continued expansion of our mortgage division in our Florida markets and overall growth in this division as we add new originators in our markets. During 2016, we began to originate a portion of our mortgage loans on a mandatory delivery basis. Prior to 2016, we originated mortgage loans on a best-efforts basis only. In connection with this transition, we elected to value our mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. This change created a one-time adjustment to mortgage division income and increased revenue by $268 thousand during 2016.\nMerchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $861 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. We entered this business line during the second quarter of 2015, so the increase during 2016 represents a full year of activity, as well as growth in the volume in this business. Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $731 thousand to $2.0 million for 2016. This increase was primarily a result of the impact of a full year of revenue attributable to Reunion. We also experienced an increase in the number of our deposit accounts. Other noninterest income increased by $1.1 million and totaled $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Most of the increase was attributable to non-recurring income, such as litigation claims and lawsuit settlements, rental income on other real estate and fees from cancellation of interest rate swaps.\nNoninterest Expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects our continued growth (organic and growth through acquisition), as well as the expansion of our operational framework, employee expansion, and facility expansion, as we build the foundation to support our growth initiatives.\nThe following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>NONINTEREST EXPENSE </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and marketing expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and casualty insurance premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounting and audit expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned, repossessed asset and other collection expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core deposit intangible amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,727 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $73.5 million and $49.1 million, respectively. The inclusion of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank in our results of operations accounted for approximately $15.0 million of the $24.4 million increase in noninterest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe largest components of noninterest expense are related to employee costs shown in the table above as salaries and employee benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense. Salaries continue to increase as we grow and expand our presence in the markets that we serve. Higher incentive compensation accruals during 2017 and a larger workforce contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits. Commission-based compensation expense is directly related to mortgage loan origination activity and certain production activity at Corporate Billing. The higher levels of revenue for the mortgage division, specifically revenue from the addition of Private Bancshares, contributed to an increase of $2.1 million in commission-based compensation during 2017 compared to 2016. Additionally, salaries and benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense for Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank employees contributed approximately $10.1 million of the $14.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense recorded during 2017 compared to 2016.\nAll categories of noninterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017. This was largely a result of the additional expenses associated with the operations of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank and the fact that we are a larger company as a result of acquisitions and organic growth. Our other noninterest expenses continue to increase as the size and complexity of our Company grows.\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased by 40.8% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of $1.2 million in expenses relating to the operation of the acquired Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank banking offices. The acquisition of our future headquarters building in August 2017 also contributed to the increase.\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $49.1 million and $40.2 million, respectively. The inclusion of Reunion in our results of operations accounted for approximately $5.4 million of the $8.8 million increase in noninterest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn May 2016, we opened a loan production office in Atlanta, Georgia, which contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense during the year ended December 31, 2016. Higher incentive compensation accruals, based on higher levels of net income, also contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits during 2016. Commission-based compensation expense is directly related to mortgage loan origination activity and certain production activity at Corporate Billing. During the year ended December 31, 2016, higher levels of revenue for the mortgage division contributed to the increased commission-based compensation expense. Additionally, salaries and benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense for Reunion's employees contributed approximately $3.3 million of the $6.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense recorded during 2016 compared to 2015.\nMost categories of noninterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, although a few experienced slight decreases. This was largely a result of the additional expenses associated with the operations of Reunion and other recent acquisitions and the fact that we are a larger company as a result of acquisitions and organic growth. Occupancy and equipment expense increased by 29.5% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses relating to the operation of the acquired Reunion banking offices. In addition, as we expand our franchise in our markets, we anticipate that other noninterest expenses will continue to grow.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense of $20.1 million, $9.4 million and $5.5 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in income tax expense during 2017 was due to an increase in pre-tax income as well as the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum tax rate of 35 percent to a flat tax rate of 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Pursuant to ASC 740-10-30-2 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and recorded the effect of this change as a component of income tax expense. The income tax expense related to the change in the enacted federal tax rate as of December 31, 2017 was $6.2 million. We should benefit in the future from lower federal income tax rates. The combination of higher pre-tax income and the write-down of our deferred tax asset resulted in a 2017 effective tax rate of 47.7% (50% including the minority interest).\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 was 32.6% (34.5% including the minority interest) and 31.9% (36.3% including the minority interest), respectively. Our effective tax rate generally is expected to increase with higher levels of taxable income. The effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal and state taxation.\nComparison of Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nOur total assets increased by $786.9 million, or 40.3%, from $1.95 billion at December 31, 2016 to $2.74 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans increased by $652.6 million, or 43.9%, from $1.49 billion at December 31, 2016 to $2.14 billion at December 31, 2017. Our total investment securities increased by $11.7 million, or 11.7%, from $99.7 million at December 31, 2016 to $111.4 million at December 31, 2017, and cash and cash equivalents increased $18.0 million during 2017 to $235.3 million at December 31, 2017. The Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank acquisitions added total assets and loans of $531.4 million and $381.7 million, respectively.\nDeposits at December 31, 2017 totaled $2.29 billion, an increase of $618.1 million compared to December 31, 2016. The Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank acquisitions added $414.0 million in deposits. As expected, a portion of our first quarter 2017 growth that was seasonal in nature exited the bank during the second and third quarters of 2017. The seasonality of certain large deposit relationships at the Bank is commensurate with the nature of the business of the respective depositors (which include, among others, tax collection authorities and other governmental entities), and as anticipated, a portion of these deposits returned during the fourth quarter of 2017, as deposits increased by $188.5 million during the 2017 fourth quarter. Deposit production is one of our primary focuses, as deposits serve as a low-cost funding source.\nOur total assets increased by $187.4 million, or 10.6%, from $1.76 billion at December 31, 2015 to $1.95 billion at December 31, 2016. Loans increased by $166.1 million, or 12.6%, from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2015 to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2016. Our total investment securities increased by $18.8 million, or 23.3%, from $80.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $99.7 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits at December 31, 2016 totaled $1.67 billion, an increase of $153.3 million compared to December 31, 2015.\nLoans\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged $1.92 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017, or 85.2% of average earning assets, compared to $1.40 billion, or 85.7% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, total loans, net of unearned income, were $2.14 billion, compared to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $652.6 million, or 43.9%. Excluding the loans acquired in the Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank transactions, loans increased by $270.8 million, or 18.2%, during 2017.\nTotal loans averaged $1.40 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, or 85.7% of average earning assets, compared to $1.01 billion, or 83.0% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, total loans, net of unearned income, were $1.49 billion, compared to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $166.1 million, or 12.6%.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions. We also have been successful in building banking relationships with new customers in the markets that we serve. We have continued to hire new bankers in some of our markets, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and new clients to the Bank. Our bankers are expected to be involved in their communities and to maintain business development efforts to develop relationships with clients.

for construction purposes. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for us in particular, to obtain a security interest in or lien on real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. This practice tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio. In many cases, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate. At December 31, 2017, this category totaled $1.71 billion and represented 79.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $1.21 billion, or 81.6%, and $1.03 billion, or 78.4%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nLoans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties ( commercial mortgage loans\u201d) increased by $281.5 million, or 46.4%, to $888.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $606.8 million at December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquired Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank loans, commercial mortgage loans increased by $99.6 million, or 16.4%, during 2017. Commercial mortgage loans increased by $97.6 million, or 19.2%, to $606.8 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $509.2 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial mortgage loans are the single largest category of loans, and, at December 31, 2017, accounted for 41.5% of the portfolio. Our management team has a great deal of experience and expertise in commercial mortgages, and this loan type has traditionally represented a large portion of our loan portfolio. Of the $888.3 million in total commercial mortgage loans at December 31, 2017, approximately $378.5 million were loans secured by owner-occupied properties.\nThe following table provides a summary of our non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans as of the dates indicated.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,963 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial/Warehouse\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,774 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>294,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,509 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential mortgage loans increased by $121.6 million, or 31.4%, to $508.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $387.3 million at December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquired Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank loans, residential mortgage loans increased by $69.1 million, or 17.8%, during 2017. Residential mortgage loans increased by $53.6 million, or 16.1%, to $387.3 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $333.8 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, residential mortgages accounted for 23.8%, 26.1% and 25.3%, respectively, of the entire loan portfolio. Our residential mortgage loan portfolio continues to grow as rates on residential mortgage loans remain historically low and housing activity is relatively strong in our markets, leading to higher origination activity for mortgage loans.\nReal estate construction, land development and other land loans totaled $231.0 million at December 31, 2017, an increase $75.2 million, or 48.3%, compared to $155.8 million at December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquired Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank loans, real estate construction, land development and other land loans increased by $2.5 million, or 1.6%, during 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, these loans increased by $2.9 million, or 1.9%, compared to $152.9 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, this loan type accounted for 10.8%, 10.5% and 11.6%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $258.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $150.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $108.3 million, or 72.1%. Excluding the acquired Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank loans, commercial and industrial loans increased by $57.1 million, or 38.0%, during 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial loans decreased by $20.9 million. The decline in commercial and industrial loans during 2016 was due to several factors, including reduced line usage by borrowers, loan paydowns, and loan payoffs. Although we experienced a decline in outstanding loan balances, in most cases, the customer relationship still exists. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, this loan type accounted for 12.1%, 10.1% and 13.0%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.\nFactored commercial receivables totaled $118.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $83.9 million at December 31, 2016. This balance fluctuates based on several variables, such as when receivables are purchased and when and how quickly payments are received. The increase at December 31, 2017 was largely attributable to increased growth in purchased receivables. A lower balance at a period end does not necessarily mean less purchase activity during the period, nor does a higher balance at period end necessarily mean more purchase activity during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we purchased factored commercial receivables of $1.03 billion, $705.9 million and $718.5 million, respectively.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us.

Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated a portion of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers the flexibility that we need to manage our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related deferred taxes. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. We have elected to classify a portion of our investment security portfolio as held-to-maturity, as we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost on our balance sheet.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity

government-sponsored entities and agencies of the United States, though we may in some situations also invest in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States. All of our residential mortgage-backed securities are issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). During 2016, we began investing in other asset-backed securities. These securities are collateralized by commercial loans, and we have invested in tranches rated AAA, AA and A by Standard & Poor's and/or Moody's.\nDuring 2017, we elected to use a portion of our balance sheet liquidity to invest $7.0 million in a United States Treasury security for pledging purposes (which matured during 2017), $10.0 million (net) in other asset-backed securities, $4.0 million in a commercial agency mortgage-backed security and $14.8 million in residential agency mortgage-backed securities. We may invest excess liquidity in securities when management determines that the yield, liquidity and interest rate risk are appropriate.\nDuring 2017, we sold twenty-four debt securities that we acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank totaling $14.5 million and did not realize a gain or loss on the sale. We took the opportunity to liquidate the acquired portfolio and reinvest as needed in securities that meet our interest rate risk parameters and credit quality metrics. In addition to these sales during 2017, we sold seven debt securities from our legacy portfolio totaling $7.8 million and realized a net loss of $91 thousand. The securities sold were low-factor residential mortgage-backed securities and one municipal security.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Provision and Asset Quality\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Provision\nThe allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in our loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance, we utilize our risk department's independent analysis of the minimum required loan loss reserve for the Bank. In this analysis, problem loans are reviewed for impairment or for loss exposure based on their payment performance and probability of default and the value of any collateral securing the loan. These totals are specifically allocated to the reserve. The loan portfolio is then divided into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing a combination of collateral codes and/or loan purpose codes and internal risk ratings. Historical losses are used to estimate the probable loss in the current portfolio based on both an average loss methodology and a migration loss methodology. The methodologies and the time periods considered are subjective and vary for each risk pool based on systematic risk relative to our ability to estimate losses for that risk pool. Because every loan has a risk of loss, the calculation begins with a minimum loss allocation for each loan pool. The minimum loss is estimated based on long-term trends for the Bank, the banking industry and the economy. Loss allocations are adjusted for changes in the economy, problem loans, payment performance, loan policy, changes in management, credit administration systems, credit concentrations, loan growth and other elements over the time periods utilized in the methodology. The adjusted loss allocations are then applied to the current balances in their respective loan pools. Loss allocations are totaled, yielding the required allowance for loan losses.\nWe incorporate the data from the allowance calculation with interim changes to that data in our ongoing determination of the allowance for loan losses. We then take into consideration other factors that may support an allowance in excess of required minimums. These factors include systems changes, historically high loan growth, concentrations in certain loan types and in certain lending relationships, changes in the economy and company management and lending practices at the time at which the loans were made. We believe that the data that we use in determining the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to estimate the potential losses in the loan portfolio; however, actual results could differ from management's estimates.\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n</td>

acquisition. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, these acquired entities' respective allowances for loan losses were not brought forward at acquisition; instead, the acquired loans were recorded at fair value, and any discount to fair value was recorded against the loans rather than as an allowance for loan losses. The portion of the discount deemed related to credit quality was recorded as a non-accretable difference, and the remaining discount was recorded as an accretable discount and accreted into interest income over the estimated average life of the loans using the level yield method. At December 31, 2017, our total acquired loan portfolios totaled $564.0 million and had an aggregate related non-accretable difference of $8.3 million and accretable discount of $5.1 million.\nFor the acquired loan portfolio, the allowance is determined for each loan pool and compared to the remaining discount for that pool. If the allowance amount calculated under the Company's methodology is greater than the Company's remaining discount, this amount is added to the reported allowance through a provision for loan losses. If the allowance amount calculated under the Company's methodology is less than the Company's recorded discount, no additional allowance or provision is recognized. Our analysis indicates that no additional allowance is necessary on our acquired loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nConsistent with prior years, asset quality indicators have remained stable or improved for the traditional bank portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, we recorded total provision expense of $3.9 million. The 2017 provision was a result of overall loan growth in each loan category rather than declining asset quality metrics. During 2017, we incurred net charge-offs of $995 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required additional provision expense. During 2016, we recorded provision expense of $3.2 million due to Corporate Billing's net charge-offs of $923 thousand, continued loan growth in certain loan segments, and the impact of uncertainty in the national and international economies on our local markets. Provision expense related to our real estate mortgage portfolio totaled $2.9 million during 2016 due to a combination of overall growth in the segment and our concentration in this portfolio. Although we experienced net recoveries for this loan type during 2016, the growth in our real estate mortgage loan portfolio and our concentration in such loans led to the 2016 provision expense for this segment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded provision expense of $1.1 million.\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses\nWhile no portion of the allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table represents management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories as of the dates indicated.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of Loans in each Category to Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.45 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.51 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.91 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.81 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.74 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Factored receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate -

General reserves are determined by applying loss percentages to each segment of our portfolio based on that segment's historical loss experience and adjustment factors derived from internal and external environmental conditions. All loans considered to be impaired are evaluated on an individual basis to determine specific reserve allocations in accordance with GAAP. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the calculation of general reserves.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> NONPERFORMING ASSETS\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate and repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.70 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.82 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.75 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period-end nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440.86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-offs to average loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming assets to period-end loans and foreclosed property and repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans to period-end loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to a consideration of these factors, we have a consistent and continuing policy of placing all loans on non-accrual status if they become 90 days or more past due, excluding factored receivables. For Corporate Billing's factored receivables, which are trade credits rather than promissory notes, our practice in most cases is to charge off unpaid recourse receivables when they become 90 days past due from the invoice due date and to charge off unpaid non-recourse receivables when they become 120 days past due from the statement billing date. For the recourse receivables, the amount of the invoice is charged against the client reserve account established for such purposes, unless the client reserve and the client's financial resources are insufficient, in which case either the amount of the invoice is charged against loans or the balance is considered impaired and the client is responsible for repaying the unpaid obligation of the account debtor. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on non-accrual status will be applied to the loan's outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased by $1.0 million to $4.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $5.5 million at December 31, 2016. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 are acquired non-accrual loans of $2.6 million and acquired other real estate of $1.1 million. Excluding the acquired nonperforming assets, nonperforming assets decreased by $2.0 million and totaled $759 thousand at December 31, 2017.

Large certificate of deposit customers and brokered and internet certificate of deposit customers tend to be more sensitive to interest rate levels.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> MATURITIES OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT OF $100,000 OR MORE\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AND OTHER TIME DEPOSITS\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over three\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> through\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> through\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Greater than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,751 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,349 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223,100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Funding Sources\nWe supplement our deposit funding with wholesale funding when needed for balance sheet planning or when the terms are attractive and will not disrupt our offering rates in our markets. One source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d). We had FHLB borrowings of $7.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and $22.0 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, a $15.0 million advance matured. We have not initiated any additional borrowings from the FHLB since 2012. We have access to brokered deposits and issued $48.9 million in brokered deposits during 2014 to fund a portion of the Bank's acquisition of its controlling interest in Corporate Billing. We had brokered deposits of $11.7 million, $25.4 million and $38.9 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Another funding source that we have used to supplement our local funding is internet certificates of deposit. We have used this source to book certificates of deposit with maturities of three to five years at rates that are lower than we would offer in our local market, typically below the rates indicated on the LIBOR swap curve for similar maturities. We had internet certificate of deposit balances of $8.6 million, $6.7 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, the acquisitions of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank added $8.3 million of brokered deposits and $8.1 million of internet certificates of deposit. We have allowed the maturing wholesale deposits to mature without replacing, and a total of $28.2 million matured during 2017.\nOn May 19, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of $25 million of our unsecured 6.0% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2026 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per year, from, and including, May 19, 2016, to, but excluding, June 1, 2021. On June 1, 2021, the Notes convert to a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 479 basis points. We may redeem the Notes after June 1, 2021. The Notes are shown as debt on our consolidated financials but are included as regulatory capital when determining certain of our regulatory capital ratios.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and in financial institutions in general will significantly impact our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of failing to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans and investment security cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit and borrowings from the FHLB.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $235.3 million, $217.3 million and $212.5 million, respectively. Based on the recorded cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity resources were sufficient at December 31, 2017 to fund loans and to meet other cash needs as necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on future obligations.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Due in 1\nyear or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 1\nthrough 3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 3\nthrough 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of less than $100k\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100k or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> CREDIT EXTENSION COMMITMENTS\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded lines\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>483,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>337,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total credit extension commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>494,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,630 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Sensitivity and Market Risk\nInterest Sensitivity\nWe monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income. The principal monitoring technique that we employ is simulation analysis, as augmented by a gap\u201d analysis.\nIn simulation analysis, we review each individual asset and liability category and its projected behavior in various interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based on our past experiences and on current competitive environments, including the environments in the different markets in which we compete. Using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models.\nAnother technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity \"gap,\" which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale or trading securities, replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time.\nThe following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2017, assuming that the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based on historical experience rather than their stated maturities.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> INTEREST

market interest rates when we have a liability-sensitive gap (a negative number). As shown in the table above, we are asset-sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout all timeframes presented. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration the fact that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short timeframe, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates, such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, we rely more on the simulation analysis (as described above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nOur earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets, primarily consisting of loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest-bearing liabilities, primarily consisting of deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing and deposit-gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies on static gap\u201d analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which quantifies, to a large extent, the degree of market risk inherent in our balance sheet. Gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above the current prevailing rates. We make certain assumptions regarding the effect that varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, based on both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As described above, this model uses estimates and assumptions regarding the manner in which asset and liability accounts will react to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. The model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest margin may (and likely will) differ from those set forth in the table.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> MARKET RISK\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact on Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in prevailing interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.52 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.37 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.60 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.31 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.85 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.64 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.75 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.95 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.01 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.32 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.34 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.19 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.96 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity attributable to us at December 31, 2017 was $392.6 million, or 14.3% of total assets. At December 31, 2016, total shareholders' equity attributable to us was $229.7 million, or 11.8% of total assets.\nOn June 12, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,104,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $40.8 million. This included 144,000 shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. The net proceeds to the Company after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses totaled $38.7 million. Other factors increasing equity during 2017 included our acquisitions of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank, the exercise of options and other rights to purchase our common stock, and our net income recorded during 2017.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC issued final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rules took effect for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a transition period for certain parts of the rules. Among other things, the rules (1) revised the minimum capital requirements and adjusted the prompt corrective action thresholds applicable to financial institutions under the agencies' jurisdiction, (2) revised the regulatory capital elements, (3) added a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, (4) increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirements and (5) implemented a new capital conservation buffer. The rules permit certain banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company and Bank have made the election to retain the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe rules are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank's capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off-balance sheet\u201d activities as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity, such as preferred stock, that may be included in capital. Certain items, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures, such as common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital. Our objective is to maintain our current status as a well-capitalized\u201d institution, as that term is defined by the Bank's regulators. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank was well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. This classification is primarily for regulatory purposes and is not intended to be interpreted as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects.\nUnder the current regulatory guidelines, banks must meet minimum capital adequacy levels based on both total assets and risk-adjusted assets. All banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%, a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) of 4%. Adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on us.\nThe table below calculates and presents regulatory capital based on the regulatory capital ratio requirements under Basel III. As of January 1, 2016, an additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes and is subject to a three-year phase-in period. The capital conservation buffer will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than 2.5% (or the required phase-in amount in years prior to 2019) will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The ratios for the Company and Bank are currently sufficient to satisfy the fully phased-in conservation buffer.\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for both NBC and NCC.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>CAPITAL ADEQUACY ANALYSIS </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe (the Company\u201d or NCC\u201d) are a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d or the Bank\u201d). Through NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama, twenty-two full-service banking offices in central and northeast Florida, and two full-service banking offices in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. Certain of our offices operate under trade names, including United Legacy Bank,\u201d Reunion Bank of Florida,\u201d Patriot Bank\u201d and FirstAtlantic Bank\u201d in Florida, and Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage\u201d in Georgia.\nWe also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing LLC ( Corporate Billing\u201d), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2018 Acquisition\nFirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc. ( FirstAtlantic\u201d), a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, through the merger of FirstAtlantic with and into NCC and of FirstAtlantic's wholly-owned subsidiary, FirstAtlantic Bank, with and into NBC. The former offices of FirstAtlantic Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name FirstAtlantic Bank.\u201d Because the acquisition was completed after year-end, the assets, liabilities and results of operations for FirstAtlantic were not included in our financial results for 2017, but they will be included in our financial results for 2018.\nIn connection with the merger, each share of FirstAtlantic common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.44 shares of our common stock or $17.25 in cash. We paid approximately $12.8 million in cash and issued 2,393,389 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $110.0 million.\nWe marked FirstAtlantic's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $489.4 million in assets at fair value from FirstAtlantic and added eight banking centers with approximately $303.9 million in loans and approximately $374.3 million in deposits. We expect to record goodwill of approximately $50.5 million and a core deposit intangible asset of approximately $6.3 million as a result of the merger. The fair value results are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing as additional information becomes available.\nAdditional information regarding the FirstAtlantic merger is included in Note 20, Subsequent Events,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\n2017 Acquisitions\nPatriot Bank\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired Patriot Bank, headquartered in Trinity, Florida, through the merger of Patriot Bank with and into NBC. The former offices of Patriot Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Patriot Bank.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Patriot Bank common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.1711 shares of NCC common stock and $0.725 in cash. We paid approximately $3.0 million in cash and issued 706,702 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $31.1 million.\nWe marked Patriot Bank's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $160.3 million in assets at fair value from Patriot Bank and added four banking centers with approximately $121.7 million in loans and approximately $127.7 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $14.7 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $899 thousand as a result of the merger.\nPrivate Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2017, we acquired Private Bancshares, Inc. ( Private Bancshares\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, through the merger of Private Bancshares with and into NCC and of Private Bancshares' wholly-owned subsidiary, Private Bank of Buckhead, with and into NBC. The former offices of Private Bank of Buckhead continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade names Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Private Bancshares common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.85417 shares of our common stock or $20.50 in cash. We paid approximately $8.3 million in cash and issued 1,809,189 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $79.9 million.\nWe marked Private Bancshares' assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $371.1 million in assets at fair value from Private Bancshares and added two banking centers with approximately $260.0 million in loans and approximately $286.2 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $47.9 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $3.0 million as a result of the merger.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d), headquartered in Tavares, Florida, through the merger of Reunion with and into NBC. The former offices of Reunion continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Reunion common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.7273 shares of our common stock or $16.00 in cash. We paid approximately $7.4 million in cash and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Patriot Bank, Private Bancshares and Reunion acquisitions is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2017 Results\nOur net income was $20.1 million in 2017, compared to $17.9 million in 2016, after taking into account a write-down of our deferred tax asset ( DTA\u201d) due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, increasing income tax expense for the year by $6.2 million. The primary factors leading to the increase in our 2017 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u25cf We acquired Private Bancshares on January 1, 2017 and Patriot Bank on August 31, 2017. As a result, our 2017 results include an entire year of revenue and expenses attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of revenue and expenses attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Average loans outstanding in 2017 were $1.92 billion, compared to $1.40 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 37.3%. The higher loan balance led to an increase in net interest income from $67.2 million in 2016 to $99.4 million in 2017. In addition to organic growth, 2017 balances include a full year of loans attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of loans attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Loan yields in 2017 averaged 5.40%, compared to 5.06% for 2016. Interest-bearing liability costs were 0.70% in 2017, compared to 0.64% in 2016. As a result, our net interest spread increased from 3.96% in 2016 to 4.20% in 2017. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $396.9 million in 2016 to $621.8 million in 2017, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of higher loan yields, relatively stable funding costs and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 4.12% in 2016 to 4.42% in 2017. \n \u25cf Average deposits in 2017 were $2.08 billion, compared to $1.52 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 36.7%. In addition to organic growth, the increase in the 2017 balances was driven by a full year of deposits attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of deposits attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Our higher net interest income in 2017 was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $73.5 million in 2017 from $49.1 million in 2016. The largest category of operating expense increase was salaries and employee benefits. The higher operating expenses resulted primarily from our expansion activities and the inclusion of expenses attributable to Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf During 2017, our noninterest income grew to $20.0 million from $14.0 million in 2016. Mortgage origination and fee income, merchant sponsorship revenue and service charges were significant contributors to this increase in 2017. \n \u25cf On June 12, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,104,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $40.8 million. This included 144,000 shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. The net proceeds to the Company after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses totaled $38.7 million. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses that we ultimately realize may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings. Management performed its quarterly analysis as of December 31, 2017 and concluded that no securities were impaired. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (1) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (2) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefits, and (3) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows related to the loans will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income.\nIn determining the initial fair value of purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration at the date of acquisition, we include an adjustment to reflect an appropriate market rate of interest given the risk profile and grade assigned to each loan. This adjustment is accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment, using the effective yield method, over the remaining life of each loan.\nWe record goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, we are required to allocate the consideration paid for an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual test of impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur other intangible assets consist of core deposit premiums acquired in connection with business combinations and are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the consummation date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of three to ten years. Amortization periods are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill and other intangibles for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income\n2017 vs. 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our net income was $20.1 million, compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12.4%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $24.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 and the $6.2 million write-down of our DTA due to the lower corporate tax rate implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2017 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2017, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $11.5 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 65.3%. Other noninterest expense increased by $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Each category of noninterest expense increased in large part as a result of a full year of activity from Private Bancshares, which we acquired on January 1, 2017, and four months of activity from Patriot Bank, which we acquired on August 31, 2017. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with our acquisition activities also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank, which we acquired on January 1, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively. The following table details the amounts that Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n2016 vs. 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income was $17.9 million, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 85.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $8.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2016 was in revenue from the mortgage division and merchant sponsorship revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2016, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $7.0 million, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 32.2%. Merchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We entered this business during April 2015, so 2016 was the first year to include this category of revenue for a full twelve-month period. Other noninterest expense increased by $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with being a public company for a full year also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that Reunion contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our 2015 results include two months of activity attributable to Reunion.\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\n\n (1) Yields on tax-exempt loans and securities have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis using an income tax rate of 37%. \nComparison of Net Interest Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet interest income increased by $32.2 million, or 48.0%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $67.2 million for 2016. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $35.2 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume, investment securities and cash balances in banks, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 37.3% increase in average loans outstanding, a 13.6% increase in average investment securities and a 67.8% increase in average cash balances in other banks during 2017 compared to 2016. The resulting net interest margin for 2017 rose to 4.42%, from 4.12% during 2016. Higher loan yields during 2017, coupled with higher rates earned on cash balances in other banks, also contributed to the increased net interest margin during 2017. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $621.8 million, compared to $396.9 million during 2016, an increase of $224.9 million, or 56.7%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $2.25 billion for 2017, compared to $1.63 billion for 2016, an increase of $620.8 million, or 38.1%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.30% to 4.90% during 2017, compared to 4.60% for 2016. During 2017, loan yields increased by 0.34% to 5.40%. The increase in loan yield was primarily attributable to recent increases in short-term interest rate indices, such as the prime rate and 30-day LIBOR, increased accretion on our acquired loan portfolios due to early pay-offs and higher rates on loans acquired from Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average loan balances of $276.4 million and $42.6 million, respectively, during 2017.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.49 billion for 2017, compared to $1.14 billion for 2016, an increase of $341.1 million, or 29.8%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.70% for 2017, compared to 0.64% for 2016. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases. The rate increase on deposit accounts was primarily due to the effect of increases in short-term rate indices, such as the prime rate, and some resultant competitive pricing pressure in certain account types, as well as the fact that rates paid on Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's interest-bearing deposits were generally higher than the rates paid on our other deposits. The increase in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing average deposits was due to organic deposit production and the inclusion of Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's deposits in our results during 2017. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average deposit balances of $304.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, during 2017.\nComparison of Net Interest Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet interest income increased by $17.1 million, or 34.2%, to $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50.0 million for 2015. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $19.7 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and investment securities, which was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 38.1% increase in average loans outstanding and a 96.6% increase in average investment securities during 2016 compared to 2015. The resulting net interest margin for 2016 rose to 4.12%, from 4.10% during 2015. Despite lower loan yields during 2016, the net interest margin in 2016 increased due to a change in our earning asset mix. During 2016, a larger percentage of our earning assets was invested in loans and investment securities, and we experienced a decrease in cash balances in other banks, our lowest-yielding asset. This change in earning asset mix, along with higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, contributed to our increased net interest margin during 2016. During 2016, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $396.9 million, compared to $269.0 million during 2015, an increase of $127.9 million, or 47.6%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $1.63 billion for 2016, compared to $1.22 billion for 2015, an increase of $410.5 million, or 33.7%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.08% to 4.60% during 2016, compared to 4.52% for 2015. The yield on interest-earning assets increased despite a decreased yield on loans during 2016. During 2016, loan yields decreased by 0.11% to 5.06%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily attributable to the fact that rates on maturing loans generally have been higher than rates on new or renewed loans and that factored receivables, which earn a higher yield than traditional loans, represented a lower proportion of our total loans in 2016.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.14 billion for 2016, compared to $877.1 million for 2015, an increase of $267.5 million, or 30.5%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.64% for 2016, compared to 0.55% for 2015. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases, with the exception of interest-bearing transaction accounts, which experienced a slight rate decrease. The rate increase on deposit accounts was due to the effect of rate increases that occurred in late 2016 and the impact of the inherited deposits of Reunion. The Reunion deposits generally had higher rates than our existing deposits. Our subordinated debt issuance in May 2016 also contributed to the increased interest-bearing liability costs for 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and 0.09% increase in the rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased our total interest expense by $2.6 million in 2016 to $7.4 million.\nThe following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates paid or earned on these assets and liabilities.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.9 million, compared to $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The provision for 2017 was a result of overall loan growth rather than declining asset quality metrics, and we incurred net charge-offs of $995 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required additional provision expense during 2017. The provision expense for 2016 was primarily attributable to growth in our overall loan portfolio, specifically our real estate-mortgage\u201d portfolio and the impact of uncertainty in the national and international economies on our local markets. We also incurred net charge-offs of $923 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required provision expense during 2016. The provision expense for 2015 was primarily related to the real estate-mortgage\u201d and construction\u201d portfolios.\nOur policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses (which is a charge to earnings) and loan recoveries, and is decreased by charge-offs. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated and an impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount generally is charged off. As of December 31, 2017, $9 thousand of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. Our mortgage division generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, NBC owns life insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. NBC also earns revenue as a sponsor bank for a provider of electronic transaction processing services for retail merchants and the consumer finance industry. This sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard networks allows the processor to accept debit and credit card transactions, and we earn a fee on each such transaction.\nAdditionally, during the 2017 third quarter, we purchased a building in Birmingham, Alabama that will serve as our corporate headquarters and replace our current leased location. We are renovating the portion of the building that we intend to occupy, and we intend to lease the remaining space to unrelated third parties. During the third quarter of 2017, we began to receive rental income related to this activity and recorded $324 thousand in rental income for the full year.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\n\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $20.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. Each category of noninterest income (except for wealth management fees) increased during 2017. The inclusion of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank in our results of operations accounted for $4.4 million of the $6.1 million increase in noninterest income recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMortgage division income increased by $4.6 million during 2017 and totaled $11.5 million for the year, compared to $7.0 million during 2016. Mortgage division production totaled $507.6 million during 2016, compared to $322.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2017, refinance activity accounted for approximately 24.3% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. A large portion of this increase was due to the acquisition of Private Bancshares, which had a sizable mortgage operation that we acquired through the transaction.\nMerchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to growth in the volume of transactions that we processed.\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $692 thousand to $2.7 million for 2017. The addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed $272 thousand of the increase for 2017. The remaining portion of this increase was a result of an increase in the number of deposit accounts, as we continue to open new accounts and gain market share in our markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income from bank-owned life insurance totaling $855 thousand, compared to $810 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during 2017 was due to the addition of the bank-owned life insurance acquired in the Private Bancshares transaction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded gains on the sale of other real estate totaling $44 thousand, compared to a gain of $244 thousand on such sales during 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $365 thousand and totaled $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Most of the increase was attributable to non-recurring income, such as a death benefit claim and refunds on unemployment taxes.\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $14.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income was higher revenue from the mortgage division in 2016. Mortgage division income increased by $1.7 million during 2016 and totaled $7.0 million for the year, compared to $5.3 million during 2015. Mortgage division production totaled $322.9 million during 2016, compared to $281.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, refinance activity accounted for approximately 22.2% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. The increased volume during 2016 was a result of our continued expansion of our mortgage division in our Florida markets and overall growth in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe (the Company\u201d or NCC\u201d) are a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d or the Bank\u201d). Through NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama, twenty-two full-service banking offices in central and northeast Florida, and two full-service banking offices in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. Certain of our offices operate under trade names, including United Legacy Bank,\u201d Reunion Bank of Florida,\u201d Patriot Bank\u201d and FirstAtlantic Bank\u201d in Florida, and Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage\u201d in Georgia.\nWe also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing LLC ( Corporate Billing\u201d), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2018 Acquisition\nFirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc. ( FirstAtlantic\u201d), a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, through the merger of FirstAtlantic with and into NCC and of FirstAtlantic's wholly-owned subsidiary, FirstAtlantic Bank, with and into NBC. The former offices of FirstAtlantic Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name FirstAtlantic Bank.\u201d Because the acquisition was completed after year-end, the assets, liabilities and results of operations for FirstAtlantic were not included in our financial results for 2017, but they will be included in our financial results for 2018.\nIn connection with the merger, each share of FirstAtlantic common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.44 shares of our common stock or $17.25 in cash. We paid approximately $12.8 million in cash and issued 2,393,389 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $110.0 million.\nWe marked FirstAtlantic's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $489.4 million in assets at fair value from FirstAtlantic and added eight banking centers with approximately $303.9 million in loans and approximately $374.3 million in deposits. We expect to record goodwill of approximately $50.5 million and a core deposit intangible asset of approximately $6.3 million as a result of the merger. The fair value results are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing as additional information becomes available.\nAdditional information regarding the FirstAtlantic merger is included in Note 20, Subsequent Events,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\n2017 Acquisitions\nPatriot Bank\nOn August 31, 2017, we acquired Patriot Bank, headquartered in Trinity, Florida, through the merger of Patriot Bank with and into NBC. The former offices of Patriot Bank continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Patriot Bank.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Patriot Bank common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.1711 shares of NCC common stock and $0.725 in cash. We paid approximately $3.0 million in cash and issued 706,702 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $31.1 million.\nWe marked Patriot Bank's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $160.3 million in assets at fair value from Patriot Bank and added four banking centers with approximately $121.7 million in loans and approximately $127.7 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $14.7 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $899 thousand as a result of the merger.\nPrivate Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2017, we acquired Private Bancshares, Inc. ( Private Bancshares\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, through the merger of Private Bancshares with and into NCC and of Private Bancshares' wholly-owned subsidiary, Private Bank of Buckhead, with and into NBC. The former offices of Private Bank of Buckhead continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade names Private Bank of Buckhead,\u201d Private Bank of Decatur\u201d and PrivatePlus Mortgage.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Private Bancshares common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.85417 shares of our common stock or $20.50 in cash. We paid approximately $8.3 million in cash and issued 1,809,189 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $79.9 million.\nWe marked Private Bancshares' assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $371.1 million in assets at fair value from Private Bancshares and added two banking centers with approximately $260.0 million in loans and approximately $286.2 million in deposits. We recorded goodwill of $47.9 million and a core deposit intangible asset of $3.0 million as a result of the merger.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d), headquartered in Tavares, Florida, through the merger of Reunion with and into NBC. The former offices of Reunion continue to operate as a division of NBC under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida.\u201d\nIn connection with the merger, each share of Reunion common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive either 0.7273 shares of our common stock or $16.00 in cash. We paid approximately $7.4 million in cash and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock as consideration in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the Patriot Bank, Private Bancshares and Reunion acquisitions is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2017 Results\nOur net income was $20.1 million in 2017, compared to $17.9 million in 2016, after taking into account a write-down of our deferred tax asset ( DTA\u201d) due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, increasing income tax expense for the year by $6.2 million. The primary factors leading to the increase in our 2017 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u25cf We acquired Private Bancshares on January 1, 2017 and Patriot Bank on August 31, 2017. As a result, our 2017 results include an entire year of revenue and expenses attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of revenue and expenses attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Average loans outstanding in 2017 were $1.92 billion, compared to $1.40 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 37.3%. The higher loan balance led to an increase in net interest income from $67.2 million in 2016 to $99.4 million in 2017. In addition to organic growth, 2017 balances include a full year of loans attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of loans attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Loan yields in 2017 averaged 5.40%, compared to 5.06% for 2016. Interest-bearing liability costs were 0.70% in 2017, compared to 0.64% in 2016. As a result, our net interest spread increased from 3.96% in 2016 to 4.20% in 2017. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $396.9 million in 2016 to $621.8 million in 2017, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of higher loan yields, relatively stable funding costs and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 4.12% in 2016 to 4.42% in 2017. \n \u25cf Average deposits in 2017 were $2.08 billion, compared to $1.52 billion in 2016, an increase of approximately 36.7%. In addition to organic growth, the increase in the 2017 balances was driven by a full year of deposits attributable to Private Bancshares and four months of deposits attributable to Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf Our higher net interest income in 2017 was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $73.5 million in 2017 from $49.1 million in 2016. The largest category of operating expense increase was salaries and employee benefits. The higher operating expenses resulted primarily from our expansion activities and the inclusion of expenses attributable to Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank. \n \u25cf During 2017, our noninterest income grew to $20.0 million from $14.0 million in 2016. Mortgage origination and fee income, merchant sponsorship revenue and service charges were significant contributors to this increase in 2017. \n \u25cf On June 12, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,104,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $40.8 million. This included 144,000 shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. The net proceeds to the Company after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering expenses totaled $38.7 million. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses that we ultimately realize may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings. Management performed its quarterly analysis as of December 31, 2017 and concluded that no securities were impaired. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (1) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (2) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefits, and (3) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows related to the loans will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income.\nIn determining the initial fair value of purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration at the date of acquisition, we include an adjustment to reflect an appropriate market rate of interest given the risk profile and grade assigned to each loan. This adjustment is accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment, using the effective yield method, over the remaining life of each loan.\nWe record goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, we are required to allocate the consideration paid for an acquired company to the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual test of impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. The measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) from the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur other intangible assets consist of core deposit premiums acquired in connection with business combinations and are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the consummation date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of three to ten years. Amortization periods are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nThe process of evaluating goodwill and other intangibles for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets. As a result, changes to these judgments, estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income\n2017 vs. 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our net income was $20.1 million, compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12.4%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $24.4 million during 2017 compared to 2016 and the $6.2 million write-down of our DTA due to the lower corporate tax rate implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2017 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2017, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $11.5 million, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 65.3%. Other noninterest expense increased by $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Each category of noninterest expense increased in large part as a result of a full year of activity from Private Bancshares, which we acquired on January 1, 2017, and four months of activity from Patriot Bank, which we acquired on August 31, 2017. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with our acquisition activities also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank, which we acquired on January 1, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively. The following table details the amounts that Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For The Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Private\nBancshares\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Patriot\nBank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 vs. 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income was $17.9 million, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 85.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits, and a resulting increase in our net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $8.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2016 was in revenue from the mortgage division and merchant sponsorship revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2016, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $7.0 million, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 32.2%. Merchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We entered this business during April 2015, so 2016 was the first year to include this category of revenue for a full twelve-month period. Other noninterest expense increased by $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate and the expenses associated with being a public company for a full year also contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that Reunion contributed to the change in selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our 2015 results include two months of activity attributable to Reunion.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,130 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET

December 31, 2017 and 2016\nNet interest income increased by $32.2 million, or 48.0%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $67.2 million for 2016. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $35.2 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume, investment securities and cash balances in banks, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 37.3% increase in average loans outstanding, a 13.6% increase in average investment securities and a 67.8% increase in average cash balances in other banks during 2017 compared to 2016. The resulting net interest margin for 2017 rose to 4.42%, from 4.12% during 2016. Higher loan yields during 2017, coupled with higher rates earned on cash balances in other banks, also contributed to the increased net interest margin during 2017. During 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $621.8 million, compared to $396.9 million during 2016, an increase of $224.9 million, or 56.7%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $2.25 billion for 2017, compared to $1.63 billion for 2016, an increase of $620.8 million, or 38.1%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.30% to 4.90% during 2017, compared to 4.60% for 2016. During 2017, loan yields increased by 0.34% to 5.40%. The increase in loan yield was primarily attributable to recent increases in short-term interest rate indices, such as the prime rate and 30-day LIBOR, increased accretion on our acquired loan portfolios due to early pay-offs and higher rates on loans acquired from Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average loan balances of $276.4 million and $42.6 million, respectively, during 2017.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.49 billion for 2017, compared to $1.14 billion for 2016, an increase of $341.1 million, or 29.8%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.70% for 2017, compared to 0.64% for 2016. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases. The rate increase on deposit accounts was primarily due to the effect of increases in short-term rate indices, such as the prime rate, and some resultant competitive pricing pressure in certain account types, as well as the fact that rates paid on Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's interest-bearing deposits were generally higher than the rates paid on our other deposits. The increase in interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing average deposits was due to organic deposit production and the inclusion of Private Bancshares' and Patriot Bank's deposits in our results during 2017. Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed average deposit balances of $304.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, during 2017.\nComparison of Net Interest Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet interest income increased by $17.1 million, or 34.2%, to $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50.0 million for 2015. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $19.7 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume and investment securities, which was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 38.1% increase in average loans outstanding and a 96.6% increase in average investment securities during 2016 compared to 2015. The resulting net interest margin for 2016 rose to 4.12%, from 4.10% during 2015. Despite lower loan yields during 2016, the net interest margin in 2016 increased due to a change in our earning asset mix. During 2016, a larger percentage of our earning assets was invested in loans and investment securities, and we experienced a decrease in cash balances in other banks, our lowest-yielding asset. This change in earning asset mix, along with higher balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, contributed to our increased net interest margin during 2016. During 2016, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $396.9 million, compared to $269.0 million during 2015, an increase of $127.9 million, or 47.6%.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $1.63 billion for 2016, compared to $1.22 billion for 2015, an increase of $410.5 million, or 33.7%. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 0.08% to 4.60% during 2016, compared to 4.52% for 2015. The yield on interest-earning assets increased despite a decreased yield on loans during 2016. During 2016, loan yields decreased by 0.11% to 5.06%. The decrease in loan yields was primarily attributable to the fact that rates on maturing loans generally have been higher than rates on new or renewed loans and that factored receivables, which earn a higher yield than traditional loans, represented a lower proportion of our total loans in 2016.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $1.14 billion for 2016, compared to $877.1 million for 2015, an increase of $267.5 million, or 30.5%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.64% for 2016, compared to 0.55% for 2015. Each category of interest-bearing liabilities experienced small rate increases, with the exception of interest-bearing transaction accounts, which experienced a slight rate decrease. The rate increase on deposit accounts was due to the effect of rate increases that occurred in late 2016 and the impact of the inherited deposits of Reunion. The Reunion deposits generally had higher rates than our existing deposits. Our subordinated debt issuance in May 2016 also contributed to the increased interest-bearing liability costs for 2016. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and 0.09% increase in the rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased our total interest expense by $2.6 million in 2016 to $7.4 million.\nThe following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates paid or earned on these assets and liabilities.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

31, 2016 and $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The provision for 2017 was a result of overall loan growth rather than declining asset quality metrics, and we incurred net charge-offs of $995 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required additional provision expense during 2017. The provision expense for 2016 was primarily attributable to growth in our overall loan portfolio, specifically our real estate-mortgage\u201d portfolio and the impact of uncertainty in the national and international economies on our local markets. We also incurred net charge-offs of $923 thousand in the factored receivables portfolio that required provision expense during 2016. The provision expense for 2015 was primarily related to the real estate-mortgage\u201d and construction\u201d portfolios.\nOur policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses (which is a charge to earnings) and loan recoveries, and is decreased by charge-offs. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated and an impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount generally is charged off. As of December 31, 2017, $9 thousand of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. Our mortgage division generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, NBC owns life insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. NBC also earns revenue as a sponsor bank for a provider of electronic transaction processing services for retail merchants and the consumer finance industry. This sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard networks allows the processor to accept debit and credit card transactions, and we earn a fee on each such transaction.\nAdditionally, during the 2017 third quarter, we purchased a building in Birmingham, Alabama that will serve as our corporate headquarters and replace our current leased location. We are renovating the portion of the building that we intend to occupy, and we intend to lease the remaining space to unrelated third parties. During the third quarter of 2017, we began to receive rental income related to this activity and recorded $324 thousand in rental income for the full year.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> NONINTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage origination and fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,278 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant sponsorship revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on sale of other real estate, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of investments available-for-sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>570 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $20.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. Each category of noninterest income (except for wealth management fees) increased during 2017. The inclusion of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank in our results of operations accounted for $4.4 million of the $6.1 million increase in noninterest income recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMortgage division income increased by $4.6 million during 2017 and totaled $11.5 million for the year, compared to $7.0 million during 2016. Mortgage division production totaled $507.6 million during 2016, compared to $322.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2017, refinance activity accounted for approximately 24.3% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. A large portion of this increase was due to the acquisition of Private Bancshares, which had a sizable mortgage operation that we acquired through the transaction.\nMerchant sponsorship revenue totaled $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to growth in the volume of transactions that we processed.\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $692 thousand to $2.7 million for 2017. The addition of Private Bancshares and Patriot Bank contributed $272 thousand of the increase for 2017. The remaining portion of this increase was a result of an increase in the number of deposit accounts, as we continue to open new accounts and gain market share in our markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income from bank-owned life insurance totaling $855 thousand, compared to $810 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during 2017 was due to the addition of the bank-owned life insurance acquired in the Private Bancshares transaction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded gains on the sale of other real estate totaling $44 thousand, compared to a gain of $244 thousand on such sales during 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $365 thousand and totaled $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Most of the increase was attributable to non-recurring income, such as a death benefit claim and refunds on unemployment taxes.\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $14.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income was higher revenue from the mortgage division in 2016. Mortgage division income increased by $1.7 million during 2016 and totaled $7.0 million for the year, compared to $5.3 million during 2015. Mortgage division production totaled $322.9 million during 2016, compared to $281.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, refinance activity accounted for approximately 22.2% of production volume, compared to approximately 26.6% during 2016. The increased volume during 2016 was a result of our continued expansion of our mortgage division in our Florida markets and overall growth in"}
