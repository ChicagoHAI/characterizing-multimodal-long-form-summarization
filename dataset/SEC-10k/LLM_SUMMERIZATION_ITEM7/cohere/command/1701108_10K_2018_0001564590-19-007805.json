Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Our most advanced product candidate, SPR994 (also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide), is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. Treatment with effective orally administrable antibiotics may prevent hospitalizations for serious infections and enable earlier, more convenient and cost-effective treatment of patients after hospitalization. We also have a platform technology known as our Potentiator Platform, which includes two IV-administered agents, SPR206 and SPR741, that are active either alone or in combination with other standard of care agents and are designed to treat MDR Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital. In addition, we are developing SPR720, an oral antibiotic designed for the treatment of pulmonary NTM infections. We believe that our novel product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, would have a meaningful patient impact and significant commercial applications for the treatment of MDR infections in both the community and hospital settings. Since our inception in 2013, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $71.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On November 14, 2017, we issued and sold an additional 471,498 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $6.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts. Aggregate net proceeds from the IPO totaled $74.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs.\nOn July 17, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,780,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.50 per share, and 2,220 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $12,500 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $70.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting $1.0 million of offering expenses payable by us.\nOn November 15, 2018, we entered into an Exchange Agreement, or the Exchange Agreement, with Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P., Biotechnology Value Fund II, L.P., Biotechnology Value Trading Fund OS, L.P. and MSI BVF SPV LLC (collectively, BVF\u201d) pursuant to which BVF agreed to exchange an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001, owned by BVF for an aggregate of 1,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, or the Series B Preferred Stock. On November 16, 2018, we designated 1,000 shares of our authorized and unissued preferred stock as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nEach share of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive a payment equal to $0.001 per share of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock before any proceeds are distributed to the holders of our common stock. The Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as required by law and except that the consent of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock holders will be required to amend the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively.\nOn December 3, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228661) with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 11, 2018, and pursuant to which we registered for sale up to $200.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on\nterms that we may determine, including up to $50.0 million of our common stock available for issuance pursuant to an at-the-market offering program sales agreement that we entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor. Under the sales agreement, Cantor may sell the shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act.\nPrior to the IPO and our July 2018 equity offering, we funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred units and bridge units and payments received under a concluded collaboration agreement and funding from government contracts. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government funding arrangements, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $115.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the initial funding committed under our award with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in July 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020, including through top-line data readout of our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994. As described elsewhere, a portion of the funding from our BARDA award supporting the development of SPR994 is scheduled to occur in periods after 2020, provided we achieve specified milestones under the award agreement and BARDA exercises all of its options under the agreement.\nThe Reorganization\nOn June 30, 2017, we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which Spero Therapeutics, LLC merged with and into Spero Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Spero OpCo, Inc.), with Spero Therapeutics, Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation. As part of the transactions, each issued and outstanding preferred and common unit of Spero Therapeutics, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization was converted into and exchanged for shares of Spero Therapeutics, Inc. capital stock of the same class and/or series on a one-for-one basis, and previously outstanding incentive units of Spero Therapeutics, LLC were cancelled. In July 2017, previous holders of the cancelled incentive units who were still employed by us at the time of the Reorganization received stock options under our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. Such stock options were granted for the same number of shares of our common stock as the number of incentive units cancelled, and the stock options were granted on the same vesting terms as the incentive units. All such stock options have an exercise price of $5.90 per share.\nUpon consummation of the Reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, LLC became the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, Inc.\nRecent Developments\nSPR994 Phase 1 Final Results and Dose Selection Data Supporting Planned Single Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial\nIn September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers. The final data support the advancement of SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg administered TID into our ADAPT-PO pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Following positive feedback from the FDA from our Pre-Phase 3 meeting, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. As a result of the meeting, we submitted an IND application for SPR994 in cUTI with the FDA, which was accepted by the FDA in February 2019. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment.\nThe single planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994, ADAPT-PO, is designed as a double-blind, double-dummy trial to compare oral SPR994 with an existing standard of care IV antibiotic, ertapenem, in approximately 1,200 patients randomized 1:1 in each arm. The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial will be the combined clinical and microbiological response at the test of cure with a 10% non-inferiority margin versus IV ertapenem. The trial will also incorporate a lead-in cohort of 70 patients with intensive pharmacokinetics assessment to confirm the dose and exposure in the cUTI patient population and we anticipate receiving interim pharmacokinetic and safety data from this lead-in cohort in the second half of 2019. We also plan to conduct routine ancillary clinical pharmacology studies in parallel with the Phase 3 trial as required by the FDA for the approval of SPR994, including a renal insufficiency study, a thorough QT prolongation study and a drug-drug interaction study.\nSPR720 preclinical data supports advancement into Phase 1 clinical trials\nIn November 2018, we announced positive results from preclinical IND-enabling studies of SPR720, our oral antimicrobial agent being developed for the treatment of NTM infections. SPR720 was assessed in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. Results from in vitro MIC studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. We believe these results, in conjunction with recent regulatory interactions, support the further development of SPR720. In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nSPR206 license agreement with Everest Medicines\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company, through our wholly owned subsidiary NPLH, entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines II Limited whereby we granted Everest an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206, or products containing SPR206, in Greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries. We retained development, manufacturing and commercialization rights with respect to SPR206 and Licensed Products in the rest of the world and also retained the right to develop or manufacture SPR206 and Licensed Products in the Territory for use outside the Territory. In addition to the license grant with respect to SPR206, we also granted to Everest a 12-month exclusive option to negotiate with us for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture or commercialize SPR741 in the same territories. We received from Everest an upfront payment of $3.0 million and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an additional $59.5 million upon Everest's achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones related to SPR206, of which we anticipate receiving at least $2.0 million in near-term milestones during 2019. Furthermore, we are eligible to receive high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing SPR206 in the covered territories following regulatory approval of SPR206.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nGrant Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nTo date, all of our revenue has been derived from government awards. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from payments under our government awards that we may enter into in the future.\nBARDA\nIn July 2018, we were awarded a contract from BARDA of up to $44.2 million to develop SPR994 for the treatment of cUTIs caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria and for assessment against biodefense pathogens. The award commits initial funding of $15.7 million over a three-year base period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021 for cUTI development activities. The balance of the award is subject to BARDA exercising two options. The exercise of the first option would entail funding of $13.6 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to our achieving specified milestones related to, among other things, clinical progress and data. The exercise of the second option would entail funding of $14.9 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to, among other things, satisfactory progress and results from certain biodefense studies. We receive funding under the BARDA award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nU.S. Department of Defense\nIn September 2016, we were awarded a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop anti-infective agents to combat Gram-negative bacteria. The agreement is structured as a single, two-year $1.5 million award. We are eligible for the full funding from DoD and there are no options to be exercised at a later date. The DoD funding supports next-generation potentiator discovery and screening of SPR741 partner antibiotics. We receive funding under the DoD award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nNIAID\nIn February 2017, we received an award from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its Small Business Innovation Research program to conduct additional preclinical studies of SPR720. The award is structured as a 12-month $0.6 million base period, which has already been committed, and a $0.4 million option period. In February 2018 NIAID exercised the $0.4 million 12-month option period. In January 2019, the period of performance for this award was extended for an additional 12-month period, through February 2020. We receive funding under the NIAID award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nIn June 2016, we entered into agreements with Pro Bono Bio PLC, a corporation organized under the laws of England, and certain of its affiliates, including PBB Distributions Limited and Cantab Anti-Infectives Limited in order to acquire certain intellectual property and government funding arrangements relating to SPR206. Under these agreements, CAI agreed to submit a request to NIAID to assign the then CAI-held NIAID contract to us. Novation of the NIAID contract was finalized in December 2017. The NIAID contract provides for development funding of up to $6.3 million over a base period and three option periods. To date, funding for the base period and the first two option periods totaling $5.7 million have been committed. We will pay PBB a percentage of funds received from NIAID up to a maximum of $1.3 million of which $0.3 million was paid upfront to PBB as part of this agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.4 million in expense related to amounts payable to PBB under this agreement.\nCARB-X\nIn April 2017, we received an award from the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, a public-private partnership funded by the BARDA within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to be used to screen, identify and complete Phase 1 clinical trials with at least one partner compound for SPR741. The award committed funding of $1.5 million over a 12-month period. On March 12, 2018, CARB-X committed an additional $0.4 million related to the first option for a period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. There will be no additional options exercised under the CARB-X award.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with CROs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred in connection with our government awards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of consultants and CMOs that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments made under third-party licensing agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, under our agreements with PBB and certain of its affiliates, CAI continued to perform research and development at our direction. We paid CAI for such research and development services at an agreed-upon rate that took into consideration costs incurred by CAI, net of amounts reimbursed to CAI by NIAID. Thus, prior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, the amount we record as research and development expenses is net of the NIAID reimbursement amount that CAI received. We also paid CAI a portion of the NIAID reimbursement received at rates specified in the agreement, which we also recorded as research and development expense.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016 and through December 31, 2018, we have recorded research and development expenses conducted by our Australian subsidiary net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive we expect to receive for qualified expenses from the Australian government.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. License fees and other costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. License fees and other costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in early stage research programs. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our preclinical programs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,553\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preclinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future as we progress our existing clinical trials and other studies of SPR994, SPR206 and SPR720, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, hire additional clinical and scientific personnel and acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties, including the following:\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain manufacturing supply;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> obtainment and maintenance of patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with Meiji with respect to SPR994;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> launch of commercial sales of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> acceptance of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition with other therapies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a continued acceptable safety profile of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research, development, and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights. Our Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event that specified milestones were achieved, which we refer to as tranche rights. We classified the tranche rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative associated with the tranche rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016.\nContingent Prepayment Options. Bridge units issued to our investors in 2016 were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We refer to these automatic conversion features as contingent prepayment options. We classified the contingent prepayment options as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment options were settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units.\nAnti-Dilution Rights. In connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted the minority investors the right to maintain ownership interests at no additional cost, subject to a maximum ownership percentage, which rights we refer to collectively as anti-dilution rights. We classified the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd. and settled the anti-dilution rights associated with the shares.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nInterest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents, which are primarily invested in money market accounts, as well as interest earned on our investments in marketable securities that we held during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other income (expense), net, consists of insignificant amounts of miscellaneous income, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and receivables from the Australian research and development tax incentive.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $100.4 million and $100.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2033. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $11.7 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and do not expire. As of December 31, 2018, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2033 and 2028, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, was treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, its owners, and not itself, were subject to U.S. federal or state income taxation on the income of Spero Therapeutics, LLC. Prior to the Reorganization, all of Spero Therapeutics, LLC's directly held subsidiaries (including Spero Therapeutics, Inc.) were treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and were subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries. Upon the Reorganization, Spero Therapeutics, Inc., whose consolidated financial statements are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, became the parent company for Spero Therapeutics, LLC's former subsidiaries and these entities continue to be subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss is a result of minority investments in our subsidiaries, Spero Europe, Ltd., Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Cantab, Inc. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., and consists of the portion of the net income or loss of these subsidiaries that is not allocated to us. Changes in the amount of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are directly impacted by changes in the net income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries and by the ownership percentage of the minority investors.\nIn May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Europe, Ltd. held by the minority investor. In June 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Potentiator, Inc. held by the minority investor. In July 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Cantab, Inc. held by the minority investor. As a result of these repurchases of the non-controlling interests, for periods subsequent to each repurchase, we no longer attribute net income (loss) to the non-controlling interest. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the remaining non-controlling interest relates only to Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFunding Received from Government Contracts, Tax Incentives and Collaborations\nSince our inception, we have been able to obtain partial funding for our research and development activities from government contracts, government tax incentives and a collaboration arrangement. The classification within our statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss of the funding received under these arrangements is subject to management judgment based on the nature of the arrangements we enter into, the source of the funding and whether the funding is considered central to our business operations.\nGovernment Contracts\nWe generate revenue from government contracts that reimburse us for certain allowable costs for funded projects. For contracts with government agencies, when we have concluded that we are the principal in conducting the research and development expenses and where the funding arrangement is considered central to our ongoing operations, we classify the recognized funding received as revenue.\nWe have concluded to recognize funding received from BARDA, the DoD, NIAID and CARB-X as revenue, rather than as a reduction of research and development expenses, because we are the principal in conducting the research and development activities and these contracts are central to our ongoing operations. We consider this revenue to be earned when we have substantially accomplished what we must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. We record revenue from government contracts for qualifying expenses that we incur. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as other receivables. The related costs incurred by us are included in research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGovernment Tax Incentives\nFor available government tax incentives that we may earn without regard to the existence of taxable income and that require us to forego tax deductions or the use of future tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we classify the funding recognized as a reduction of the related qualifying research and development expenses incurred.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016, our operating subsidiary in Australia has met the eligibility requirements to receive a 43.5% tax incentive for qualifying research and development activities. We recognize these incentives as a reduction of research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the related qualifying expenses are incurred. Reductions of research and development expense recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of tax incentive payments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as tax incentive receivables. Related to these incentives, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $1.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCollaboration Agreements\nFor collaboration agreements with a third party, to determine the appropriate statement of operations classification of the recognized funding, we first assess whether the collaboration arrangement is within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. If it is, we evaluate the collaborative arrangement for proper classification in the statement of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity and we assess the payments to and from the collaborative partner. If the payments to and from the collaborative partner are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting guidance, we base the statement of operations classification for the payments received on a reasonable, rational analogy to authoritative accounting guidance, applied in a consistent manner. Conversely, if the collaboration arrangement is not within the scope of accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements, we assess whether the collaboration arrangement represents a vendor/customer relationship. If the collaborative arrangement does not represent a vendor/customer relationship, we then classify the funding payments received in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss as a reduction of the related expense that is incurred.\nFor example, in 2014, we entered into a research and development services and support agreement with Roche and concluded that the agreements were not within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. Due to the co-funded nature of the payments and our assessment that we did not have a vendor/customer relationship with Roche, we recognized the nonrefundable payments received under the agreement as a reduction to the research and development expenses incurred. We terminated our agreement with Roche in August 2016. Related to payments received under this concluded collaboration, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however,\nsome require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendor in connection with the preclinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, had granted incentive units, which we accounted for as equity-classified awards. Subsequent to the Reorganization on June 30, 2017, we began granting common stock options.\nWe measure all share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and we recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock or common units and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock or common units, the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, and our expected dividend yield.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Common Units and Common Stock Prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common units and common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common units and common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each award grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common unit and common stock valuations were prepared using the option pricing method, or OPM, which used a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats the company's securities as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock and, prior to the Reorganization, the common units, have value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred share liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common units or common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common units or common stock. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common units of $4.08 per unit as of February 26, 2016 and $1.95 per unit as of March 10, 2017, and a valuation of our common stock of $5.90 per share as of June 30, 2017. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common units and common stock as of each grant date, which may be a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the prices at which we sold preferred units and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock and preferred units relative to our common stock and common units at the time of each grant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the lack of an active public market for our common and preferred stock and our common units and preferred units;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nValuation of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights\nOur Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with tranche rights, which provided these investors the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event certain milestones were achieved. We classified each of the tranche rights as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet, and remeasured to fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the tranche rights at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016, and we stopped recognizing changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the tranche rights at that time.\nContingent Prepayment Option\nBridge units issued to our investors in 2015 and 2016 contained contingent prepayment options, whereby such units were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We classified the contingent prepayment options as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We remeasured the fair value of the derivative liabilities at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2015 was settled in 2015 upon the issuance of Class A preferred units. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2016 was settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units in March 2017. In periods subsequent to the settlement of any contingent prepayment option, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled contingent prepayment option.\nAnti-Dilution Rights\nIn connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted anti-dilution rights to the minority investors. We classify the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because they are freestanding instruments that represent a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares. We remeasure the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd., at which time the anti-dilution rights were settled. As of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nIn periods subsequent to the settlement of any anti-dilution rights, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled anti-dilution right. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The most significant assumption in the discounted cash flow model impacting the fair value of the anti-dilution rights is the probability that we would fund the maximum amount of investment providing anti-dilution protection. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using the PWERM, which considered as inputs the probability and time that a subsequent round of preferred stock financing would occur and the risk-adjusted discount rate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December

qualifying expenses incurred in connection with our various government awards. The increase in revenue during 2018 was primarily due to funding received under our BARDA contract, which was awarded to us in July 2018, and for which we began incurring qualified expenses in the second half of 2018, as well as the NIAID contract, which provides funding for SPR206, which was novated to us from CAI in December 2017. Offsetting these increases, were decreases in funding received under our DoD agreement, as well as our CARB-X award, which had a performance period through March 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,553\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preclinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect costs related to our SPR994 program increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to clinical trial costs, including expenses related to our Phase 1 clinical trial, which commenced in October 2017 and which was completed in August 2018, costs related to our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as higher expenses related to formulation development, manufacturing process and manufacturing of clinical trial material. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in preclinical costs for this program related to costs incurred in 2017 in connection with the initiation our Phase 1 clinical trial, as well as $1.6 million of upfront and milestones payments incurred and paid in 2017 under our agreement with Meiji. Additionally, during 2018, research and development expenses for our SPR994 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of $0.9 million.\nDirect costs related to our Potentiator Platform include costs related to our SPR206 and SPR741 programs. We designated SPR206 as a product candidate in July 2017, before which costs were captured as preclinical costs. Direct costs related to our SPR206 program increased by $6.0 million during 2018, primarily due to a full year of preclinical costs related to toxicology studies and manufacturing efforts to support our Phase 1 study of SPR206, which we initiated in December 2018, as well as $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR206. We expect direct costs related to our SPR206 program to continue to increase as we continue to progress our Phase 1 clinical trial. Direct costs related to our SPR741 program decreased by $9.5 million during 2018, primarily due to the completion of our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom during the first half of 2018. Additionally, research and development expenses for our SPR741 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of less than $0.1 million in 2018, compared to $1.8 million in 2017. Because our Phase 1b clinical trial of SPR741 is complete, we anticipate that our direct costs related to our SPR741 program will continue at a reduced level pending our prioritization of our Potentiator product candidates.\nDirect costs related to our SPR720 program increased during 2018 primarily related to costs incurred to prepare for the Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, which we initiated in January 2019, as well as related manufacturing expense and $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR720.\nDirect costs related to our preclinical programs decreased by $1.3 million during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to lower spending on preclinical programs as we focused development efforts on our more advanced product candidates.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.3 million included in unallocated expenses was due to an increase in research and development headcount. Personnel-related costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger group of research and development personnel and their research efforts, as well as expense incurred during the third quarter of 2018, related to the write-off of certain leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment as a result of the closure of our Watertown, Massachusetts laboratory facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional and consultant fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,014\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.4 million was primarily a result of an increase in headcount in our general and administrative function as we operate as a public company. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included share-based compensation expense of $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional and consultant fees is primarily related to higher expenses incurred during 2017 in connection with the Reorganization as well as our preparations to operate as a public company.\nThe increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger number of general and administrative personnel.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $1.1 million during 2018, compared to $1.8 million during 2017. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of other income of $1.8 million, which was primarily related to interest income on our invested cash balances and marketable securities, partially offset by $0.7 million of other expenses. Other income, net was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and primarily consisted of a decrease of $1.5 million in the fair value of the derivative liability for anti-dilution rights granted to minority investors in Spero Gyrase Inc. and Spero Europe Ltd. resulting from our discontinuation of the underlying development programs of these subsidiaries, as well as interest income of $0.3 million related to interest earned on invested cash balances.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Grant revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41,730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33,221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,509\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,886\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,641\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to Spero Therapeutics, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,743\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,491\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,252\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrant Revenue\nGrant revenue recognized during 2017 was primarily due to the reimbursement of qualifying expenses incurred in connection with our CARB-X award related to our SPR741 program of $0.9 million as well as $0.7 million under our award from the DoD, also related to our SPR741 program.

Direct costs related to our SPR994 program during 2017 were primarily due to preclinical manufacturing and preclinical costs as we focused efforts on formulation development, manufacturing process and manufacturing of clinical trial material in anticipation of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which commenced in October 2017. We also incurred $1.6 million of research and development expense related to a payment of $1.0 million to Meiji Seika Pharma Co. Ltd. that became due and was paid in October 2017 under our know-how license with Meiji upon the enrollment of the first patient in clinical trials and $0.6 million for an upfront license fee paid to Meiji.\nDirect costs related to our SPR741 program decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to a decrease in preclinical costs resulting from costs incurred in the prior year to support our Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, filing in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase in clinical trial costs and manufacturing costs as well as expense related to a total payment to Northern Antibiotics OY Ltd. of $2.6 million which became due and was paid under our agreements with Northern upon the completion of our IPO in November 2017 (a CTN, which is similar to an IND in the United States, enables conduct of a clinical trial in Australia). The increase in clinical trial costs and manufacturing costs was due to our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR741, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as manufacturing of clinical trial materials for our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom, which was initiated in November 2017, and a possible Phase 2 clinical trial. Research and development expenses for our SPR741 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. We designated SPR206 as a product candidate in July 2017. Direct costs related to our SPR206 program during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily due to preclinical and manufacturing costs related to IND-enabling toxicology studies.\nWe designated SPR720 as a product candidate in the second half of 2016. Direct costs related to our SPR720 program during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily due to preclinical and manufacturing costs related to IND-enabling toxicology studies.\nDirect costs related to our preclinical programs decreased by $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year due primarily to the cost of in-licensing technology incurred in 2016 of $5.1 million and to decreased spending on preclinical programs in 2017. The cost of in-licensing technology incurred in 2016 of $5.1 million was a result of the issuance of equity and anti-dilution rights to Promiliad Biopharma Inc., or Promiliad, Biota Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc.), or Aviragen, and PBB, and a license fee payment of $0.5 million we made to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Our research and development expenses related to our preclinical programs decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 as we focused development efforts on our product candidates. Direct costs related to our preclinical programs were recorded net of the recognition of funding received from a concluded collaboration agreement of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs included in unallocated expenses was due to an increase in headcount in our research and development function. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included share-based compensation\nexpense of $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to new laboratory space and the increased costs of supporting a larger group of research and development personnel and their research efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 360: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional and consultant fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in personnel-related costs was primarily a result of an increase in headcount in our general and administrative function and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional employee stock options granted at a higher fair value of our common stock. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nThe increase in professional and consultant fees primarily consisted of an increase in professional fees, including accounting, audit, business development and legal fees, as well as costs associated with ongoing business activities and our preparations to operate as a public company. We also incurred increased legal fees in connection with the Reorganization.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was primarily due to a decrease of $1.5 million in the fair value of the derivative liability for anti-dilution rights granted to minority investors in Spero Gyrase Inc. and Spero Europe Ltd. resulting from our discontinuation of the underlying development programs of these subsidiaries. We also had interest income of $0.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as a result of interest earned on invested cash balances.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with the DoD, NIAID, CARB-X and BARDA. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sales of preferred units and bridge units, payments received under a concluded collaboration agreement and funding from government contracts and, most recently, in November 2017 with proceeds from the IPO of our common stock, and in July 2018 with an underwritten public offering of our common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $115.4 million.\nOn December 3, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228661) with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 11, 2018, and pursuant to which we registered for sale up to $200.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, including up to $50.0 million of our common stock available for issuance pursuant to an at-the-market offering program sales agreement that we entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Under the sales agreement, Cantor may sell shares of our common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, subject to the terms of the sales agreement. We have not sold any shares of our common stock under the sales agreement.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,111\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,959\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (53,258\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $39.6 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $41.7 million, adjusted for net non-cash items of $3.1 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities was $1.1 million and consisted primarily of a $5.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets as we prepare to initiate our pivotal Phase 3 trial for SPR994, a $1.2 million increase in other assets, and partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in receivables related to the Australian research and development tax incentive and to our government contracts, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.7 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.1 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of $39.9 million, adjusted for net non-cash items of $0.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities was $0.4 million and consisted primarily of a $2.5 million increase in receivables related to the Australian research and development tax incentive and to our government contracts, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities used $29.0 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $32.6 million and cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $4.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of a $1.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $0.9 million decrease in advance payments from collaborator, a $0.6 million decrease in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase in receivables related to our government awards and the Australian research and development tax incentive, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The decrease in advance payments from collaborator was primarily a result of the recognition of research funding received in prior periods as an offset to research and development expense as well as the termination of our collaboration agreement in August 2016, at which time we recognized the remaining portion of the liability that had been recorded in a prior year.\nChanges in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and prepaid expenses and other current assets in all periods were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our development programs and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $83.2 million and primarily related to the net purchase of marketable securities, as well as $2.4 million of fixed assets purchased, which included $1.6 million of fixed assets which will be used in manufacturing related activities at Meiji. We did not use any significant cash for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment, primarily for our new office and laboratory spaces.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, of $69.5 million primarily consisted of $69.5 million of net proceeds from our July 2018 equity offering (after deducting offering costs of $1.0 million), as well as $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by $0.3 million of deferred offering costs related to our December 2018 registration statement and at-the-market facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $116.1 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $74.2 million from the completion of our IPO in November 2017, as well as $43.1 million from the sale of our Class C\npreferred units, partially offset by $1.2 million of cash used to purchase outstanding shares of Spero Potentiator, Inc. and Spero Cantab, Inc. from the minority interest holders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $34.4 million, consisting of net proceeds of $25.9 million from the sale of our Class B preferred units and proceeds of $8.5 million the sale of our 2016 bridge units.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates in development. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\nTable 362: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our other product candidates and potential new product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of funding that we receive under government contracts that we have applied for;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities for SPR994 and other product candidates if we receive marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the receipt of marketing approval and revenue received from any potential commercial sales of SPR994;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights, including milestone and royalty payments and patent prosecution fees that we are obligated to pay pursuant to our license agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of operating as a public company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the initial funding committed under our BARDA award in July 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020, including through the top-line data readout of our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994. However, we do not expect that these funds will be sufficient to fund the development of all of our product candidates through regulatory approval and commercialization. As described elsewhere, a portion of the funding from our BARDA award supporting the development of SPR994 is scheduled to occur in periods after 2020, provided we achieve specified milestones under the award agreement and BARDA exercises all of its options under the agreement.\nWe have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including those listed above.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government funding, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 374: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Reflects payments due for our leases of laboratory and office space under operating lease agreements that expire in 2019 and 2025, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs further described below, under various licensing and related agreements with third parties, we have agreed to make milestone payments and pay royalties to third parties. We have not included any contingent payment obligations, such as milestones or royalties, in the table above as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known.\nUnder our license agreement with Meiji, we are obligated (i) to make milestone payments of up to $3.0 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones, (ii) to pay royalties, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement and (iii) to pay to Meiji a low double-digit percentage of any sublicense fees received by us up to $7.5 million. In October 2017, we paid a $1.0 million milestone payment to Meiji upon the enrollment of the first patient in our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994, which was recorded as research and development expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018 we paid Meiji approximately $1.6 million related to fixed assets which will be used in manufacturing related activities at Meiji. The equipment has been capitalized as property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nUnder our license agreement with Northern, we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $7.0 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, commercial and other milestones. Upon the closing of our IPO in November 2017, we paid Northern $2.6 million in connection with this license agreement.\nUnder an agreement we entered into with PBB, we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $5.8 million upon the achievement of specified clinical milestones and a payment of \u00a35.0 million ($6.4 million as of December 31, 2018) upon the achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, we have agreed to pay to PBB royalties, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR206.\nUnder our agreement with Vertex, we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $81.1 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and to pay to Vertex tiered royalties, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, of a mid single-digit to low double-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR720.\nUnder our agreement with Aviragen, we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $12.0 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and to pay royalties of low single-digit percentages based on net sales of products we acquired under the agreement. We are no longer pursuing development of the technology acquired under the agreement, and do not anticipate any such payments to be made in the future.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other third parties for clinical trials, preclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services. These contracts are cancelable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our\nservice providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial

As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Our most advanced product candidate, SPR994 (also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide), is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. Treatment with effective orally administrable antibiotics may prevent hospitalizations for serious infections and enable earlier, more convenient and cost-effective treatment of patients after hospitalization. We also have a platform technology known as our Potentiator Platform, which includes two IV-administered agents, SPR206 and SPR741, that are active either alone or in combination with other standard of care agents and are designed to treat MDR Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital. In addition, we are developing SPR720, an oral antibiotic designed for the treatment of pulmonary NTM infections. We believe that our novel product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, would have a meaningful patient impact and significant commercial applications for the treatment of MDR infections in both the community and hospital settings. Since our inception in 2013, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $71.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On November 14, 2017, we issued and sold an additional 471,498 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $6.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts. Aggregate net proceeds from the IPO totaled $74.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs.\nOn July 17, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,780,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.50 per share, and 2,220 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $12,500 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $70.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting $1.0 million of offering expenses payable by us.\nOn November 15, 2018, we entered into an Exchange Agreement, or the Exchange Agreement, with Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P., Biotechnology Value Fund II, L.P., Biotechnology Value Trading Fund OS, L.P. and MSI BVF SPV LLC (collectively, BVF\u201d) pursuant to which BVF agreed to exchange an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001, owned by BVF for an aggregate of 1,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, or the Series B Preferred Stock. On November 16, 2018, we designated 1,000 shares of our authorized and unissued preferred stock as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nEach share of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive a payment equal to $0.001 per share of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock before any proceeds are distributed to the holders of our common stock. The Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as required by law and except that the consent of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock holders will be required to amend the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively.\nOn December 3, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228661) with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 11, 2018, and pursuant to which we registered for sale up to $200.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on\nterms that we may determine, including up to $50.0 million of our common stock available for issuance pursuant to an at-the-market offering program sales agreement that we entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor. Under the sales agreement, Cantor may sell the shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act.\nPrior to the IPO and our July 2018 equity offering, we funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred units and bridge units and payments received under a concluded collaboration agreement and funding from government contracts. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government funding arrangements, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $115.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the initial funding committed under our award with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in July 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020, including through top-line data readout of our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994. As described elsewhere, a portion of the funding from our BARDA award supporting the development of SPR994 is scheduled to occur in periods after 2020, provided we achieve specified milestones under the award agreement and BARDA exercises all of its options under the agreement.\nThe Reorganization\nOn June 30, 2017, we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which Spero Therapeutics, LLC merged with and into Spero Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Spero OpCo, Inc.), with Spero Therapeutics, Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation. As part of the transactions, each issued and outstanding preferred and common unit of Spero Therapeutics, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization was converted into and exchanged for shares of Spero Therapeutics, Inc. capital stock of the same class and/or series on a one-for-one basis, and previously outstanding incentive units of Spero Therapeutics, LLC were cancelled. In July 2017, previous holders of the cancelled incentive units who were still employed by us at the time of the Reorganization received stock options under our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. Such stock options were granted for the same number of shares of our common stock as the number of incentive units cancelled, and the stock options were granted on the same vesting terms as the incentive units. All such stock options have an exercise price of $5.90 per share.\nUpon consummation of the Reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, LLC became the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, Inc.\nRecent Developments\nSPR994 Phase 1 Final Results and Dose Selection Data Supporting Planned Single Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial\nIn September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers. The final data support the advancement of SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg administered TID into our ADAPT-PO pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Following positive feedback from the FDA from our Pre-Phase 3 meeting, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. As a result of the meeting, we submitted an IND application for SPR994 in cUTI with the FDA, which was accepted by the FDA in February 2019. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment.\nThe single planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994, ADAPT-PO, is designed as a double-blind, double-dummy trial to compare oral SPR994 with an existing standard of care IV antibiotic, ertapenem, in approximately 1,200 patients randomized 1:1 in each arm. The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial will be the combined clinical and microbiological response at the test of cure with a 10% non-inferiority margin versus IV ertapenem. The trial will also incorporate a lead-in cohort of 70 patients with intensive pharmacokinetics assessment to confirm the dose and exposure in the cUTI patient population and we anticipate receiving interim pharmacokinetic and safety data from this lead-in cohort in the second half of 2019. We also plan to conduct routine ancillary clinical pharmacology studies in parallel with the Phase 3 trial as required by the FDA for the approval of SPR994, including a renal insufficiency study, a thorough QT prolongation study and a drug-drug interaction study.\nSPR720 preclinical data supports advancement into Phase 1 clinical trials\nIn November 2018, we announced positive results from preclinical IND-enabling studies of SPR720, our oral antimicrobial agent being developed for the treatment of NTM infections. SPR720 was assessed in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. Results from in vitro MIC studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. We believe these results, in conjunction with recent regulatory interactions, support the further development of SPR720. In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nSPR206 license agreement with Everest Medicines\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company, through our wholly owned subsidiary NPLH, entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines II Limited whereby we granted Everest an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206, or products containing SPR206, in Greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries. We retained development, manufacturing and commercialization rights with respect to SPR206 and Licensed Products in the rest of the world and also retained the right to develop or manufacture SPR206 and Licensed Products in the Territory for use outside the Territory. In addition to the license grant with respect to SPR206, we also granted to Everest a 12-month exclusive option to negotiate with us for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture or commercialize SPR741 in the same territories. We received from Everest an upfront payment of $3.0 million and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an additional $59.5 million upon Everest's achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones related to SPR206, of which we anticipate receiving at least $2.0 million in near-term milestones during 2019. Furthermore, we are eligible to receive high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing SPR206 in the covered territories following regulatory approval of SPR206.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nGrant Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nTo date, all of our revenue has been derived from government awards. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from payments under our government awards that we may enter into in the future.\nBARDA\nIn July 2018, we were awarded a contract from BARDA of up to $44.2 million to develop SPR994 for the treatment of cUTIs caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria and for assessment against biodefense pathogens. The award commits initial funding of $15.7 million over a three-year base period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021 for cUTI development activities. The balance of the award is subject to BARDA exercising two options. The exercise of the first option would entail funding of $13.6 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to our achieving specified milestones related to, among other things, clinical progress and data. The exercise of the second option would entail funding of $14.9 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to, among other things, satisfactory progress and results from certain biodefense studies. We receive funding under the BARDA award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nU.S. Department of Defense\nIn September 2016, we were awarded a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop anti-infective agents to combat Gram-negative bacteria. The agreement is structured as a single, two-year $1.5 million award. We are eligible for the full funding from DoD and there are no options to be exercised at a later date. The DoD funding supports next-generation potentiator discovery and screening of SPR741 partner antibiotics. We receive funding under the DoD award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nNIAID\nIn February 2017, we received an award from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its Small Business Innovation Research program to conduct additional preclinical studies of SPR720. The award is structured as a 12-month $0.6 million base period, which has already been committed, and a $0.4 million option period. In February 2018 NIAID exercised the $0.4 million 12-month option period. In January 2019, the period of performance for this award was extended for an additional 12-month period, through February 2020. We receive funding under the NIAID award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nIn June 2016, we entered into agreements with Pro Bono Bio PLC, a corporation organized under the laws of England, and certain of its affiliates, including PBB Distributions Limited and Cantab Anti-Infectives Limited in order to acquire certain intellectual property and government funding arrangements relating to SPR206. Under these agreements, CAI agreed to submit a request to NIAID to assign the then CAI-held NIAID contract to us. Novation of the NIAID contract was finalized in December 2017. The NIAID contract provides for development funding of up to $6.3 million over a base period and three option periods. To date, funding for the base period and the first two option periods totaling $5.7 million have been committed. We will pay PBB a percentage of funds received from NIAID up to a maximum of $1.3 million of which $0.3 million was paid upfront to PBB as part of this agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.4 million in expense related to amounts payable to PBB under this agreement.\nCARB-X\nIn April 2017, we received an award from the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, a public-private partnership funded by the BARDA within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to be used to screen, identify and complete Phase 1 clinical trials with at least one partner compound for SPR741. The award committed funding of $1.5 million over a 12-month period. On March 12, 2018, CARB-X committed an additional $0.4 million related to the first option for a period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. There will be no additional options exercised under the CARB-X award.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with CROs; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with our government awards; \n \u2022 the cost of consultants and CMOs that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nPrior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, under our agreements with PBB and certain of its affiliates, CAI continued to perform research and development at our direction. We paid CAI for such research and development services at an agreed-upon rate that took into consideration costs incurred by CAI, net of amounts reimbursed to CAI by NIAID. Thus, prior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, the amount we record as research and development expenses is net of the NIAID reimbursement amount that CAI received. We also paid CAI a portion of the NIAID reimbursement received at rates specified in the agreement, which we also recorded as research and development expense.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016 and through December 31, 2018, we have recorded research and development expenses conducted by our Australian subsidiary net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive we expect to receive for qualified expenses from the Australian government.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. License fees and other costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. License fees and other costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in early stage research programs. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our preclinical programs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\n\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future as we progress our existing clinical trials and other studies of SPR994, SPR206 and SPR720, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, hire additional clinical and scientific personnel and acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n \u2022 successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u2022 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain manufacturing supply; \n \u2022 obtainment and maintenance of patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with Meiji with respect to SPR994; \n \u2022 protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 launch of commercial sales of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 acceptance of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u2022 competition with other therapies; and \n \u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research, development, and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights. Our Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event that specified milestones were achieved, which we refer to as tranche rights. We classified the tranche rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative associated with the tranche rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016.\nContingent Prepayment Options. Bridge units issued to our investors in 2016 were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We refer to these automatic conversion features as contingent prepayment options. We classified the contingent prepayment options as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment options were settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units.\nAnti-Dilution Rights. In connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted the minority investors the right to maintain ownership interests at no additional cost, subject to a maximum ownership percentage, which rights we refer to collectively as anti-dilution rights. We classified the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd. and settled the anti-dilution rights associated with the shares.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nInterest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents, which are primarily invested in money market accounts, as well as interest earned on our investments in marketable securities that we held during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other income (expense), net, consists of insignificant amounts of miscellaneous income, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and receivables from the Australian research and development tax incentive.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $100.4 million and $100.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2033. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $11.7 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and do not expire. As of December 31, 2018, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2033 and 2028, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, was treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, its owners, and not itself, were subject to U.S. federal or state income taxation on the income of Spero Therapeutics, LLC. Prior to the Reorganization, all of Spero Therapeutics, LLC's directly held subsidiaries (including Spero Therapeutics, Inc.) were treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and were subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries. Upon the Reorganization, Spero Therapeutics, Inc., whose consolidated financial statements are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, became the parent company for Spero Therapeutics, LLC's former subsidiaries and these entities continue to be subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss is a result of minority investments in our subsidiaries, Spero Europe, Ltd., Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Cantab, Inc. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., and consists of the portion of the net income or loss of these subsidiaries that is not allocated to us. Changes in the amount of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are directly impacted by changes in the net income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries and by the ownership percentage of the minority investors.\nIn May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Europe, Ltd. held by the minority investor. In June 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Potentiator, Inc. held by the minority investor. In July 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Cantab, Inc. held by the minority investor. As a result of these repurchases of the non-controlling interests, for periods subsequent to each repurchase, we no longer attribute net income (loss) to the non-controlling interest. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the remaining non-controlling interest relates only to Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFunding Received from Government Contracts, Tax Incentives and Collaborations\nSince our inception, we have been able to obtain partial funding for our research and development activities from government contracts, government tax incentives and a collaboration arrangement. The classification within our statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss of the funding received under these arrangements is subject to management judgment based on the nature of the arrangements we enter into, the source of the funding and whether the funding is considered central to our business operations.\nGovernment Contracts\nWe generate revenue from government contracts that reimburse us for certain allowable costs for funded projects. For contracts with government agencies, when we have concluded that we are the principal in conducting the research and development expenses and where the funding arrangement is considered central to our ongoing operations, we classify the recognized funding received as revenue.\nWe have concluded to recognize funding received from BARDA, the DoD, NIAID and CARB-X as revenue, rather than as a reduction of research and development expenses, because we are the principal in conducting the research and development activities and these contracts are central to our ongoing operations. We consider this revenue to be earned when we have substantially accomplished what we must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. We record revenue from government contracts for qualifying expenses that we incur. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as other receivables. The related costs incurred by us are included in research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGovernment Tax Incentives\nFor available government tax incentives that we may earn without regard to the existence of taxable income and that require us to forego tax deductions or the use of future tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we classify the funding recognized as a reduction of the related qualifying research and development expenses incurred.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016, our operating subsidiary in Australia has met the eligibility requirements to receive a 43.5% tax incentive for qualifying research and development activities. We recognize these incentives as a reduction of research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the related qualifying expenses are incurred. Reductions of research and development expense recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of tax incentive payments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as tax incentive receivables. Related to these incentives, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $1.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCollaboration Agreements\nFor collaboration agreements with a third party, to determine the appropriate statement of operations classification of the recognized funding, we first assess whether the collaboration arrangement is within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. If it is, we evaluate the collaborative arrangement for proper classification in the statement of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity and we assess the payments to and from the collaborative partner. If the payments to and from the collaborative partner are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting guidance, we base the statement of operations classification for the payments received on a reasonable, rational analogy to authoritative accounting guidance, applied in a consistent manner. Conversely, if the collaboration arrangement is not within the scope of accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements, we assess whether the collaboration arrangement represents a vendor/customer relationship. If the collaborative arrangement does not represent a vendor/customer relationship, we then classify the funding payments received in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss as a reduction of the related expense that is incurred.\nFor example, in 2014, we entered into a research and development services and support agreement with Roche and concluded that the agreements were not within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. Due to the co-funded nature of the payments and our assessment that we did not have a vendor/customer relationship with Roche, we recognized the nonrefundable payments received under the agreement as a reduction to the research and development expenses incurred. We terminated our agreement with Roche in August 2016. Related to payments received under this concluded collaboration, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however,\nsome require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendor in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, had granted incentive units, which we accounted for as equity-classified awards. Subsequent to the Reorganization on June 30, 2017, we began granting common stock options.\nWe measure all share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and we recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock or common units and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock or common units, the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, and our expected dividend yield.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Common Units and Common Stock Prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common units and common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common units and common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each award grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common unit and common stock valuations were prepared using the option pricing method, or OPM, which used a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats the company's securities as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock and, prior to the Reorganization, the common units, have value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred share liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common units or common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common units or common stock. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common units of $4.08 per unit as of February 26, 2016 and $1.95 per unit as of March 10, 2017, and a valuation of our common stock of $5.90 per share as of June 30, 2017. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common units and common stock as of each grant date, which may be a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:\n \u2022 the prices at which we sold preferred units and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock and preferred units relative to our common stock and common units at the time of each grant; \n \u2022 the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy; \n \u2022 external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry; \n \u2022 our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results; \n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common and preferred stock and our common units and preferred units; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and \n \u2022 the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. \nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nValuation of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights\nOur Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with tranche rights, which provided these investors the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event certain milestones were achieved. We classified each of the tranche rights as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet, and remeasured to fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the tranche rights at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016, and we stopped recognizing changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the tranche rights at that time.\nContingent Prepayment Option\nBridge units issued to our investors in 2015 and 2016 contained contingent prepayment options, whereby such units were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We classified the contingent prepayment options as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We remeasured the fair value of the derivative liabilities at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2015 was settled in 2015 upon the issuance of Class A preferred units. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2016 was settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units in March 2017. In periods subsequent to the settlement of any contingent prepayment option, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled contingent prepayment option.\nAnti-Dilution Rights\nIn connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted anti-dilution rights to the minority investors. We classify the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because they are freestanding instruments that represent a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares. We remeasure the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd., at which time the anti-dilution rights were settled. As of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nIn periods subsequent to the settlement of any anti-dilution rights, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled anti-dilution right. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The most significant assumption in the discounted cash flow model impacting the fair value of the anti-dilution rights is the probability that we would fund the maximum amount of investment providing anti-dilution protection. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using the PWERM, which considered as inputs the probability and time that a subsequent round of preferred stock financing would occur and the risk-adjusted discount rate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nGrant Revenue\n\nGrant revenue recognized during 2018 and 2017 consisted of the reimbursement of qualifying expenses incurred in connection with our various government awards. The increase in revenue during 2018 was primarily due to funding received under our BARDA contract, which was awarded to us in July 2018, and for which we began incurring qualified expenses in the second half of 2018, as well as the NIAID contract, which provides funding for SPR206, which was novated to us from CAI in December 2017. Offsetting these increases, were decreases in funding received under our DoD agreement, as well as our CARB-X award, which had a performance period through March 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nDirect costs related to our SPR994 program increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to clinical trial costs, including expenses related to our Phase 1 clinical trial, which commenced in October 2017 and which was completed in August 2018, costs related to our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as higher expenses related to formulation development, manufacturing process and manufacturing of clinical trial material. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in preclinical costs for this program related to costs incurred in 2017 in connection with the initiation our Phase 1 clinical trial, as well as $1.6 million of upfront and milestones payments incurred and paid in 2017 under our agreement with Meiji. Additionally, during 2018, research and development expenses for our SPR994 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of $0.9 million.\nDirect costs related to our Potentiator Platform include costs related to our SPR206 and SPR741 programs. We designated SPR206 as a product candidate in July 2017, before which costs were captured as preclinical costs. Direct costs related to our SPR206 program increased by $6.0 million during 2018, primarily due to a full year of preclinical costs related to toxicology studies and manufacturing efforts to support our Phase 1 study of SPR206, which we initiated in December 2018, as well as $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR206. We expect direct costs related to our SPR206 program to continue to increase as we continue to progress our Phase 1 clinical trial. Direct costs related to our SPR741 program decreased by $9.5 million during 2018, primarily due to the completion of our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom during the first half of 2018. Additionally, research and development expenses for our SPR741 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of less than $0.1 million in 2018, compared to $1.8 million in 2017. Because our Phase 1b clinical trial of SPR741 is complete, we anticipate that our direct costs related to our SPR741 program will continue at a reduced level pending our prioritization of our Potentiator product candidates.\nDirect costs related to our SPR720 program increased during 2018 primarily related to costs incurred to prepare for the Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, which we initiated in January 2019, as well as related manufacturing expense and $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR720.\nDirect costs related to our preclinical programs decreased by $1.3 million during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to lower spending on preclinical programs as we focused development efforts on our more advanced product candidates.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.3 million included in unallocated expenses was due to an increase in research and development headcount. Personnel-related costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger group of research and development personnel and their research efforts, as well as expense incurred during the third quarter of 2018, related to the write-off of certain leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment as a result of the closure of our Watertown, Massachusetts laboratory facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.4 million was primarily a result of an increase in headcount in our general and administrative function as we operate as a public company. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included share-based compensation expense of $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nThe decrease in professional and consultant fees is primarily related to higher expenses incurred during 2017 in connection with the Reorganization as well as our preparations to operate as a public company.\nThe increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger number of general and administrative personnel.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $1.1 million during 2018, compared to $1.8 million during 2017. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of other income of $1.8 million, which was primarily related to interest income on our invested cash balances and marketable securities, partially offset by $0.7 million of other expenses. Other income, net was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and primarily consisted of a decrease of $1.5 million in the fair value of the derivative liability for anti-dilution rights granted to minority investors in Spero Gyrase Inc. and Spero Europe Ltd. resulting from our discontinuation of the underlying development programs of these subsidiaries, as well as interest income of $0.3 million related to interest earned on invested cash balances.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n Year Ended December 31, ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Our most advanced product candidate, SPR994 (also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide), is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. Treatment with effective orally administrable antibiotics may prevent hospitalizations for serious infections and enable earlier, more convenient and cost-effective treatment of patients after hospitalization. We also have a platform technology known as our Potentiator Platform, which includes two IV-administered agents, SPR206 and SPR741, that are active either alone or in combination with other standard of care agents and are designed to treat MDR Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital. In addition, we are developing SPR720, an oral antibiotic designed for the treatment of pulmonary NTM infections. We believe that our novel product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, would have a meaningful patient impact and significant commercial applications for the treatment of MDR infections in both the community and hospital settings. Since our inception in 2013, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing product and technology rights, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO and issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $71.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering costs. On November 14, 2017, we issued and sold an additional 471,498 shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $14.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $6.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts. Aggregate net proceeds from the IPO totaled $74.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs.\nOn July 17, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,780,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.50 per share, and 2,220 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $12,500 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $70.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting $1.0 million of offering expenses payable by us.\nOn November 15, 2018, we entered into an Exchange Agreement, or the Exchange Agreement, with Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P., Biotechnology Value Fund II, L.P., Biotechnology Value Trading Fund OS, L.P. and MSI BVF SPV LLC (collectively, BVF\u201d) pursuant to which BVF agreed to exchange an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001, owned by BVF for an aggregate of 1,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, or the Series B Preferred Stock. On November 16, 2018, we designated 1,000 shares of our authorized and unissued preferred stock as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nEach share of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive a payment equal to $0.001 per share of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock before any proceeds are distributed to the holders of our common stock. The Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as required by law and except that the consent of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock holders will be required to amend the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively.\nOn December 3, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228661) with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 11, 2018, and pursuant to which we registered for sale up to $200.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on\nterms that we may determine, including up to $50.0 million of our common stock available for issuance pursuant to an at-the-market offering program sales agreement that we entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor. Under the sales agreement, Cantor may sell the shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act.\nPrior to the IPO and our July 2018 equity offering, we funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of preferred units and bridge units and payments received under a concluded collaboration agreement and funding from government contracts. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government funding arrangements, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $115.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the initial funding committed under our award with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in July 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020, including through top-line data readout of our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994. As described elsewhere, a portion of the funding from our BARDA award supporting the development of SPR994 is scheduled to occur in periods after 2020, provided we achieve specified milestones under the award agreement and BARDA exercises all of its options under the agreement.\nThe Reorganization\nOn June 30, 2017, we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which Spero Therapeutics, LLC merged with and into Spero Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Spero OpCo, Inc.), with Spero Therapeutics, Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation. As part of the transactions, each issued and outstanding preferred and common unit of Spero Therapeutics, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization was converted into and exchanged for shares of Spero Therapeutics, Inc. capital stock of the same class and/or series on a one-for-one basis, and previously outstanding incentive units of Spero Therapeutics, LLC were cancelled. In July 2017, previous holders of the cancelled incentive units who were still employed by us at the time of the Reorganization received stock options under our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. Such stock options were granted for the same number of shares of our common stock as the number of incentive units cancelled, and the stock options were granted on the same vesting terms as the incentive units. All such stock options have an exercise price of $5.90 per share.\nUpon consummation of the Reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, LLC became the historical consolidated financial statements of Spero Therapeutics, Inc.\nRecent Developments\nSPR994 Phase 1 Final Results and Dose Selection Data Supporting Planned Single Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial\nIn September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers. The final data support the advancement of SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg administered TID into our ADAPT-PO pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Following positive feedback from the FDA from our Pre-Phase 3 meeting, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. As a result of the meeting, we submitted an IND application for SPR994 in cUTI with the FDA, which was accepted by the FDA in February 2019. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment.\nThe single planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994, ADAPT-PO, is designed as a double-blind, double-dummy trial to compare oral SPR994 with an existing standard of care IV antibiotic, ertapenem, in approximately 1,200 patients randomized 1:1 in each arm. The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial will be the combined clinical and microbiological response at the test of cure with a 10% non-inferiority margin versus IV ertapenem. The trial will also incorporate a lead-in cohort of 70 patients with intensive pharmacokinetics assessment to confirm the dose and exposure in the cUTI patient population and we anticipate receiving interim pharmacokinetic and safety data from this lead-in cohort in the second half of 2019. We also plan to conduct routine ancillary clinical pharmacology studies in parallel with the Phase 3 trial as required by the FDA for the approval of SPR994, including a renal insufficiency study, a thorough QT prolongation study and a drug-drug interaction study.\nSPR720 preclinical data supports advancement into Phase 1 clinical trials\nIn November 2018, we announced positive results from preclinical IND-enabling studies of SPR720, our oral antimicrobial agent being developed for the treatment of NTM infections. SPR720 was assessed in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. Results from in vitro MIC studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. We believe these results, in conjunction with recent regulatory interactions, support the further development of SPR720. In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nSPR206 license agreement with Everest Medicines\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company, through our wholly owned subsidiary NPLH, entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines II Limited whereby we granted Everest an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206, or products containing SPR206, in Greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries. We retained development, manufacturing and commercialization rights with respect to SPR206 and Licensed Products in the rest of the world and also retained the right to develop or manufacture SPR206 and Licensed Products in the Territory for use outside the Territory. In addition to the license grant with respect to SPR206, we also granted to Everest a 12-month exclusive option to negotiate with us for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture or commercialize SPR741 in the same territories. We received from Everest an upfront payment of $3.0 million and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an additional $59.5 million upon Everest's achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones related to SPR206, of which we anticipate receiving at least $2.0 million in near-term milestones during 2019. Furthermore, we are eligible to receive high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing SPR206 in the covered territories following regulatory approval of SPR206.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nGrant Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nTo date, all of our revenue has been derived from government awards. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from payments under our government awards that we may enter into in the future.\nBARDA\nIn July 2018, we were awarded a contract from BARDA of up to $44.2 million to develop SPR994 for the treatment of cUTIs caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria and for assessment against biodefense pathogens. The award commits initial funding of $15.7 million over a three-year base period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021 for cUTI development activities. The balance of the award is subject to BARDA exercising two options. The exercise of the first option would entail funding of $13.6 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to our achieving specified milestones related to, among other things, clinical progress and data. The exercise of the second option would entail funding of $14.9 million and is exercisable by BARDA subject to, among other things, satisfactory progress and results from certain biodefense studies. We receive funding under the BARDA award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nU.S. Department of Defense\nIn September 2016, we were awarded a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop anti-infective agents to combat Gram-negative bacteria. The agreement is structured as a single, two-year $1.5 million award. We are eligible for the full funding from DoD and there are no options to be exercised at a later date. The DoD funding supports next-generation potentiator discovery and screening of SPR741 partner antibiotics. We receive funding under the DoD award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nNIAID\nIn February 2017, we received an award from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its Small Business Innovation Research program to conduct additional preclinical studies of SPR720. The award is structured as a 12-month $0.6 million base period, which has already been committed, and a $0.4 million option period. In February 2018 NIAID exercised the $0.4 million 12-month option period. In January 2019, the period of performance for this award was extended for an additional 12-month period, through February 2020. We receive funding under the NIAID award as we incur qualifying expenses.\nIn June 2016, we entered into agreements with Pro Bono Bio PLC, a corporation organized under the laws of England, and certain of its affiliates, including PBB Distributions Limited and Cantab Anti-Infectives Limited in order to acquire certain intellectual property and government funding arrangements relating to SPR206. Under these agreements, CAI agreed to submit a request to NIAID to assign the then CAI-held NIAID contract to us. Novation of the NIAID contract was finalized in December 2017. The NIAID contract provides for development funding of up to $6.3 million over a base period and three option periods. To date, funding for the base period and the first two option periods totaling $5.7 million have been committed. We will pay PBB a percentage of funds received from NIAID up to a maximum of $1.3 million of which $0.3 million was paid upfront to PBB as part of this agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $0.4 million in expense related to amounts payable to PBB under this agreement.\nCARB-X\nIn April 2017, we received an award from the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, a public-private partnership funded by the BARDA within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to be used to screen, identify and complete Phase 1 clinical trials with at least one partner compound for SPR741. The award committed funding of $1.5 million over a 12-month period. On March 12, 2018, CARB-X committed an additional $0.4 million related to the first option for a period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. There will be no additional options exercised under the CARB-X award.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with CROs; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with our government awards; \n \u2022 the cost of consultants and CMOs that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nPrior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, under our agreements with PBB and certain of its affiliates, CAI continued to perform research and development at our direction. We paid CAI for such research and development services at an agreed-upon rate that took into consideration costs incurred by CAI, net of amounts reimbursed to CAI by NIAID. Thus, prior to novation of the NIAID contract to us in December 2017, the amount we record as research and development expenses is net of the NIAID reimbursement amount that CAI received. We also paid CAI a portion of the NIAID reimbursement received at rates specified in the agreement, which we also recorded as research and development expense.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016 and through December 31, 2018, we have recorded research and development expenses conducted by our Australian subsidiary net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive we expect to receive for qualified expenses from the Australian government.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. License fees and other costs incurred after a product candidate has been designated and that are directly related to the product candidate are included in direct research and development expenses for that program. License fees and other costs incurred prior to designating a product candidate are included in early stage research programs. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our preclinical programs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by development program:\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,553\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preclinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future as we progress our existing clinical trials and other studies of SPR994, SPR206 and SPR720, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, hire additional clinical and scientific personnel and acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n \u2022 successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u2022 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain manufacturing supply; \n \u2022 obtainment and maintenance of patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with Meiji with respect to SPR994; \n \u2022 protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 launch of commercial sales of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 acceptance of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; \n \u2022 competition with other therapies; and \n \u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of SPR994 and our other product candidates, if approved. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research, development, and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights. Our Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event that specified milestones were achieved, which we refer to as tranche rights. We classified the tranche rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative associated with the tranche rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016.\nContingent Prepayment Options. Bridge units issued to our investors in 2016 were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We refer to these automatic conversion features as contingent prepayment options. We classified the contingent prepayment options as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment options were settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units.\nAnti-Dilution Rights. In connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted the minority investors the right to maintain ownership interests at no additional cost, subject to a maximum ownership percentage, which rights we refer to collectively as anti-dilution rights. We classified the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd. and settled the anti-dilution rights associated with the shares.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nInterest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents, which are primarily invested in money market accounts, as well as interest earned on our investments in marketable securities that we held during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other income (expense), net, consists of insignificant amounts of miscellaneous income, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency-denominated cash balances, vendor payables and receivables from the Australian research and development tax incentive.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $100.4 million and $100.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2033. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $11.7 million, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and do not expire. As of December 31, 2018, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2033 and 2028, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, was treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, its owners, and not itself, were subject to U.S. federal or state income taxation on the income of Spero Therapeutics, LLC. Prior to the Reorganization, all of Spero Therapeutics, LLC's directly held subsidiaries (including Spero Therapeutics, Inc.) were treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and were subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries. Upon the Reorganization, Spero Therapeutics, Inc., whose consolidated financial statements are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, became the parent company for Spero Therapeutics, LLC's former subsidiaries and these entities continue to be subject to taxation in the United States or in other countries.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss is a result of minority investments in our subsidiaries, Spero Europe, Ltd., Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Cantab, Inc. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., and consists of the portion of the net income or loss of these subsidiaries that is not allocated to us. Changes in the amount of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are directly impacted by changes in the net income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries and by the ownership percentage of the minority investors.\nIn May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Europe, Ltd. held by the minority investor. In June 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Potentiator, Inc. held by the minority investor. In July 2017, we repurchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Spero Cantab, Inc. held by the minority investor. As a result of these repurchases of the non-controlling interests, for periods subsequent to each repurchase, we no longer attribute net income (loss) to the non-controlling interest. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the remaining non-controlling interest relates only to Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nFunding Received from Government Contracts, Tax Incentives and Collaborations\nSince our inception, we have been able to obtain partial funding for our research and development activities from government contracts, government tax incentives and a collaboration arrangement. The classification within our statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss of the funding received under these arrangements is subject to management judgment based on the nature of the arrangements we enter into, the source of the funding and whether the funding is considered central to our business operations.\nGovernment Contracts\nWe generate revenue from government contracts that reimburse us for certain allowable costs for funded projects. For contracts with government agencies, when we have concluded that we are the principal in conducting the research and development expenses and where the funding arrangement is considered central to our ongoing operations, we classify the recognized funding received as revenue.\nWe have concluded to recognize funding received from BARDA, the DoD, NIAID and CARB-X as revenue, rather than as a reduction of research and development expenses, because we are the principal in conducting the research and development activities and these contracts are central to our ongoing operations. We consider this revenue to be earned when we have substantially accomplished what we must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. We record revenue from government contracts for qualifying expenses that we incur. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as other receivables. The related costs incurred by us are included in research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGovernment Tax Incentives\nFor available government tax incentives that we may earn without regard to the existence of taxable income and that require us to forego tax deductions or the use of future tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we classify the funding recognized as a reduction of the related qualifying research and development expenses incurred.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016, our operating subsidiary in Australia has met the eligibility requirements to receive a 43.5% tax incentive for qualifying research and development activities. We recognize these incentives as a reduction of research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the related qualifying expenses are incurred. Reductions of research and development expense recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of tax incentive payments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as tax incentive receivables. Related to these incentives, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $1.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCollaboration Agreements\nFor collaboration agreements with a third party, to determine the appropriate statement of operations classification of the recognized funding, we first assess whether the collaboration arrangement is within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. If it is, we evaluate the collaborative arrangement for proper classification in the statement of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity and we assess the payments to and from the collaborative partner. If the payments to and from the collaborative partner are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting guidance, we base the statement of operations classification for the payments received on a reasonable, rational analogy to authoritative accounting guidance, applied in a consistent manner. Conversely, if the collaboration arrangement is not within the scope of accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements, we assess whether the collaboration arrangement represents a vendor/customer relationship. If the collaborative arrangement does not represent a vendor/customer relationship, we then classify the funding payments received in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss as a reduction of the related expense that is incurred.\nFor example, in 2014, we entered into a research and development services and support agreement with Roche and concluded that the agreements were not within the scope of the accounting guidance for collaboration arrangements. Due to the co-funded nature of the payments and our assessment that we did not have a vendor/customer relationship with Roche, we recognized the nonrefundable payments received under the agreement as a reduction to the research and development expenses incurred. We terminated our agreement with Roche in August 2016. Related to payments received under this concluded collaboration, we recognized reductions of research and development expense of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however,\nsome require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendor in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical and clinical studies; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nPrior to the Reorganization, our former parent company, Spero Therapeutics, LLC, had granted incentive units, which we accounted for as equity-classified awards. Subsequent to the Reorganization on June 30, 2017, we began granting common stock options.\nWe measure all share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and we recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock or common units and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock or common units, the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options and incentive units, and our expected dividend yield.\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Common Units and Common Stock Prior to our IPO\nAs there was no public market for our common units and common stock prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common units and common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each award grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common unit and common stock valuations were prepared using the option pricing method, or OPM, which used a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats the company's securities as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock and, prior to the Reorganization, the common units, have value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred share liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. A discount for lack of marketability of the common units or common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common units or common stock. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common units of $4.08 per unit as of February 26, 2016 and $1.95 per unit as of March 10, 2017, and a valuation of our common stock of $5.90 per share as of June 30, 2017. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common units and common stock as of each grant date, which may be a date later than the most recent third-party valuation date, including:\n \u2022 the prices at which we sold preferred units and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock and preferred units relative to our common stock and common units at the time of each grant; \n \u2022 the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy; \n \u2022 external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry, and trends within the biotechnology industry; \n \u2022 our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results; \n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common and preferred stock and our common units and preferred units; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and \n \u2022 the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. \nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nValuation of Derivative Liabilities\nTranche Rights\nOur Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units provided our investors with tranche rights, which provided these investors the right to participate in subsequent offerings of Class A and Class B preferred units in the event certain milestones were achieved. We classified each of the tranche rights as a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet, and remeasured to fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the tranche rights at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The tranche rights were settled in 2016, and we stopped recognizing changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the tranche rights at that time.\nContingent Prepayment Option\nBridge units issued to our investors in 2015 and 2016 contained contingent prepayment options, whereby such units were automatically convertible into equity units sold in a subsequent round of qualified financing at a discounted rate. We classified the contingent prepayment options as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We remeasured the fair value of the derivative liabilities at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the contingent prepayment options as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2015 was settled in 2015 upon the issuance of Class A preferred units. The contingent prepayment option associated with the bridge units issued in 2016 was settled in the first quarter of 2017 upon the issuance of Class C preferred units in March 2017. In periods subsequent to the settlement of any contingent prepayment option, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled contingent prepayment option.\nAnti-Dilution Rights\nIn connection with the issuance of non-controlling interests in certain of our subsidiaries, specifically Spero Potentiator, Inc., Spero Europe, Ltd. and Spero Gyrase, Inc., we granted anti-dilution rights to the minority investors. We classify the anti-dilution rights as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because they are freestanding instruments that represent a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares. We remeasure the derivative liabilities associated with the anti-dilution rights to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities as a component of other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2016, anti-dilution rights related to Spero Potentiator, Inc. were fully settled as the maximum number of shares to be issued to the minority investor had been reached in August 2016. In May 2017, we repurchased 100% of the minority investor's outstanding shares in Spero Europe, Ltd., at which time the anti-dilution rights were settled. As of December 31, 2018, the derivative liability of $0.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet relates only to the anti-dilution rights held by the minority investor in Spero Gyrase, Inc.\nIn periods subsequent to the settlement of any anti-dilution rights, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the settled anti-dilution right. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The most significant assumption in the discounted cash flow model impacting the fair value of the anti-dilution rights is the probability that we would fund the maximum amount of investment providing anti-dilution protection. The fair value of these derivative liabilities was determined using the PWERM, which considered as inputs the probability and time that a subsequent round of preferred stock financing would occur and the risk-adjusted discount rate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December

qualifying expenses incurred in connection with our various government awards. The increase in revenue during 2018 was primarily due to funding received under our BARDA contract, which was awarded to us in July 2018, and for which we began incurring qualified expenses in the second half of 2018, as well as the NIAID contract, which provides funding for SPR206, which was novated to us from CAI in December 2017. Offsetting these increases, were decreases in funding received under our DoD agreement, as well as our CARB-X award, which had a performance period through March 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by program:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,553\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SPR720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preclinical programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect costs related to our SPR994 program increased during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to clinical trial costs, including expenses related to our Phase 1 clinical trial, which commenced in October 2017 and which was completed in August 2018, costs related to our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as higher expenses related to formulation development, manufacturing process and manufacturing of clinical trial material. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in preclinical costs for this program related to costs incurred in 2017 in connection with the initiation our Phase 1 clinical trial, as well as $1.6 million of upfront and milestones payments incurred and paid in 2017 under our agreement with Meiji. Additionally, during 2018, research and development expenses for our SPR994 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of $0.9 million.\nDirect costs related to our Potentiator Platform include costs related to our SPR206 and SPR741 programs. We designated SPR206 as a product candidate in July 2017, before which costs were captured as preclinical costs. Direct costs related to our SPR206 program increased by $6.0 million during 2018, primarily due to a full year of preclinical costs related to toxicology studies and manufacturing efforts to support our Phase 1 study of SPR206, which we initiated in December 2018, as well as $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR206. We expect direct costs related to our SPR206 program to continue to increase as we continue to progress our Phase 1 clinical trial. Direct costs related to our SPR741 program decreased by $9.5 million during 2018, primarily due to the completion of our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom during the first half of 2018. Additionally, research and development expenses for our SPR741 program conducted by our Australian subsidiary were recorded net of a 43.5% research and development tax incentive for qualified expenses from the Australian government of less than $0.1 million in 2018, compared to $1.8 million in 2017. Because our Phase 1b clinical trial of SPR741 is complete, we anticipate that our direct costs related to our SPR741 program will continue at a reduced level pending our prioritization of our Potentiator product candidates.\nDirect costs related to our SPR720 program increased during 2018 primarily related to costs incurred to prepare for the Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720, which we initiated in January 2019, as well as related manufacturing expense and $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR720.\nDirect costs related to our preclinical programs decreased by $1.3 million during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to lower spending on preclinical programs as we focused development efforts on our more advanced product candidates.\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.3 million included in unallocated expenses was due to an increase in research and development headcount. Personnel-related costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The increase in facility-related and other costs was primarily due to the increased costs of supporting a larger group of research and development personnel and their research efforts, as well as expense incurred during the third quarter of 2018, related to the write-off of certain leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment as a result of the closure of our Watertown, Massachusetts laboratory facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related (including share-based compensation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional and consultant fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,014\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility related and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in personnel-related costs of $2.4 million was primarily a result of an increase in headcount in our general and administrative function as we operate as a public company.

Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of other income of $1.8 million, which was primarily related to interest income on our invested cash balances and marketable securities, partially offset by $0.7 million of other expenses. Other income, net was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and primarily consisted of a decrease of $1.5 million in the fair value of the derivative liability for anti-dilution rights granted to minority investors in Spero Gyrase Inc. and Spero Europe Ltd. resulting from our discontinuation of the underlying development programs of these subsidiaries, as well as interest income of $0.3 million related to interest earned on invested cash balances.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n Year Ended December 31, "}
