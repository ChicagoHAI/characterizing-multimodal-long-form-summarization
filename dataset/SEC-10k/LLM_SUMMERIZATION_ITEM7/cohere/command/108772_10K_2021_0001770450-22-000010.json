Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThroughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) that follows, references to \"Xerox Holdings\" refer to Xerox Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, while references to \"Xerox\" refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to we,\u201d \"us,\" our,\u201d or the Company,\u201d refer collectively to both Xerox Holdings and Xerox unless the context suggests otherwise. References to Xerox Holdings Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries. References to Xerox Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone company and do not include subsidiaries.\nCurrently, Xerox Holdings' primary direct operating subsidiary is Xerox and Xerox reflects nearly all of Xerox Holdings' operations. Accordingly, the following MD&A primarily focuses on the operations of Xerox and is intended to help the reader understand Xerox's business and its results of operations and financial condition. Throughout this combined Form 10-K, references are made to various notes in the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Part II, Item 8 of this combined Form 10-K, and the information contained in such notes is incorporated by reference into the MD&A in the places where such references are made.\nXerox Holdings' other direct subsidiary is Xerox Ventures LLC, which was established in 2021 solely to invest in startups and early/mid-stage growth companies aligned with the Company's innovation focus areas and targeted adjacencies. Xerox Ventures LLC had investments of approximately $8 million at December 31, 2021. Due to its immaterial nature, and for ease of discussion, Xerox Ventures LLC's results are included within the following discussion.\nExecutive Overview\nOur expectation entering 2021 was that in-office work would normalize following 2020's wave of COVID-19 infections and the global rollout of effective vaccines. However, the emergence of various variants of COVID-19 in 2021 resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to the workplace and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact resulted in a reduction in expected Post sale revenue and profits. In the second half of the year, we also experienced an unprecedented level of supply chain disruption, in part due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with conditions deteriorating throughout the final two quarters of the year. These disruptions resulted in revenue falling below expectations for the year, with most of the shortfall comprised of high-margin mid-range devices and Post sale revenue. Supply chain disruptions also drove an increase in our backlog1 of equipment and IT hardware to nearly $350 million, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than at the end of 2020. We continue to streamline and optimize our operations and exceeded our target Project Own It savings of $375 million in 2021.\nAs we head into 2022, demand for our equipment remains strong as evidenced by our backlog1 of approximately $350 million as of year-end, which is primarily comprised of high-margin office equipment. We expect to have an elevated backlog1 at least through the first half of the year. As the backlog1 clears, our equipment revenue mix is expected to improve, which should result in improvements in gross margin. We also expect that there will be a broader return of workers to the office in the second half of 2022 and for Xerox, the correlation between return-to-work trends, page volumes, and post sale revenues remains strong, which suggests employees print when they return to the office and clients continue to value our printing services.\nAlthough our financial results are expected to improve in 2022, our earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2021 includes an after-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) or $4.38 and $4.08 per share, respectively. This charge largely reflects the impact that the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the Xerox print business. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by growth of our digital services and offerings targeted for hybrid work business models. Additionally, the Company is currently pursuing its strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses, such as financing, software and innovation to offset and, eventually, exceed reduced cash flows from the print business, but this strategy will take time to develop. Refer to the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A as well as Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Financial Overview for further discussion regarding additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in 2021 and 2020.\n_____________\n(1)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT services offerings.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 27\nBusiness Overview\nWith annual revenues of approximately $7.0 billion, we remain a leading global provider of digital print technology and related services, software and solutions. Our primary offerings span four main areas: Workplace Solutions, Production Solutions, Xerox Services and FITTLE. We disclosed at our Investor Conference on February 23, 2022, that we have rebranded our Xerox Financial Services (XFS) business, which is now known as FITTLE.\n\u2022Workplace Solutions includes two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, much of which share common solutions, apps and ConnectKey\u00ae software. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products (captured primarily as equipment sales) as well as the supplies and associated technical services and the financing of those products through FITTLE (captured as post sale revenue).\n\u2022Production Solutions are designed for customers in the graphic communications, in-plant and production print environments with high-volume printing requirements.\n\u2022Xerox Services includes a continuum of solutions and services that helps our customers optimize their print and communications infrastructure, apply automation and simplification to maximize productivity, and ensure the highest levels of security. Our primary offerings in this area are Managed Print Services (MPS), Capture & Content Services (CCS) and Customer Engagement Services (CES) as well as IT Services. CCS and CES encompass a range of Digital Services that leverage our software capabilities in Workflow Automation, Personalization and Communication Software, Content Management Solutions, and Digitization Services.\n\u2022FITTLE (formerly XFS) is a global financing solutions business and currently offers financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through our indirect channels.\nIn addition to our four primary offering areas described above, a smaller but growing portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue, as well as from IT Services, CareAR, which is comprised of DocuShare\u00ae and XMPie, and PARC (Innovation).\nHeadquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, with approximately 23,300 employees, Xerox serves customers in approximately 160 countries. We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to printing production companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2021, approximately 40% of our revenue was generated outside the United States.\nMarket and Business Strategy\nOur market and business strategy is to maintain overall market share leadership in our core market and increase our participation in the growth areas, while expanding into adjacent markets and leveraging our innovation capabilities to enter new markets. The Company's four strategic initiatives, summarized below, remain at the core of how we operate and deliver results for all stakeholders.\n1.Optimize Operations for Simplicity\n\u2022Continuously improve operating efficiency, revenue flow-through and return on assets\n\u2022Invest in augmented reality, robotic process automation, business process outsourcing, analytics and system enhancements to drive efficiencies\n2.Drive Revenue\n\u2022Drive increased adoption and utilization of CareAR\n\u2022Scale IT Services and robotic process automation in the SMB market\n\u2022Grow our financing business as a global financing solutions business\n\u2022Expand distribution of digital solutions among existing Print and Services clients\n3.Monetize Innovation\n\u2022Leverage $250 million corporate venture fund to bolster investment and innovation\n\u2022Add value-added equity partners to accelerate development and market penetration\n\u2022Embed PARC's technology into new and existing businesses\n4.Focus on cash flow and increasing capital returns\n\u2022Maximize annual free cash flow1 generation\n\u2022Deploy excess capital for strategic M&A\n\u2022Opportunistic share repurchases\n_____________\n(1)Free cash flow is defined as Operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 28\nPost-sale Based Business Model\nIn 2021, 78% of our total revenue was post-sale based, which includes contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenue streams generally follow equipment placements and provide some stability to our revenue and cash flows. Key indicators of future post sale revenue include installs and related removals of printers and multifunction devices, the number and type of machines in the field (MIF), page volumes (including the mix of pages printed on our MIF, including color devices) and the type and nature of related software and services provided to customers. Post sale revenue also includes transactional IT hardware sales and implementation services primarily from our XBS organization.\nProject Own It\nDuring the second half of 2018, we initiated a transformation project - Project Own It - centered on creating a more effective organization to enhance our focus on our customers and our partners, instill a culture of continuous improvement and improve our financial results through on-going cost reductions and savings. The primary goal of this project is to improve productivity by driving end-to-end transformation of our processes and systems to improve effectiveness and to reduce costs. These efforts are considered critical to making us more competitive and giving us the capacity to invest in growth and maximize shareholder returns. Key opportunities under Project Own It include establishing more effective shared service centers (captive and through our outsource partners), rationalizing our IT infrastructure, reducing our real estate footprint, and improving our supply chain management and the productivity of our supplier base. In 2021, we exceeded our gross savings target of $375 million. Since its inception, total savings from Project Own It are approximately $1.8 billion. We expect to generate approximately $300 million of gross savings in 2022.\nThis project also involves evaluating the sourcing of all of our products to optimize our options. Our approach is to analyze our potential options both by product category and holistically to determine what sourcing makes the most strategic and economic sense.\nIn March 2019, as part of Project Own It, Xerox entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we transitioned certain global administrative and support functions, including selected finance functions, from Xerox to HCL. In July 2021, Xerox entered into an arrangement with Tata Consulting Services (TCS), whereby TCS will provide business processing outsourcing services in support of our global finance organization. This will include the transition of the finance processes currently being provided by HCL.\nWe incurred restructuring and related costs, net of $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to costs incurred to implement initiatives under our business transformation projects including Project Own It. Refer to Restructuring and Related Costs, Net section of the MD&A and Note 14 - Restructuring Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Businesses Strategy\nIn 2021, we stood up three new businesses: CareAR, Xerox Financial Services (now known as FITTLE) and Innovation (PARC). As a result of this effort, we believe we are positioned to begin reporting separate financial and non-financial information for each business in 2022.\nCareAR Holdings (CareAR) is Xerox's newly formed software business and is comprised of: CareAR, Inc., an enterprise augmented reality business Xerox acquired in late 2020; DocuShare\u00ae, a cloud-based content management system; and XMPie, a multi-channel marketing software platform. Together, these software assets combine to provide an AR and AI-driven visual support platform that provides real-time access to expertise for service companies, field service employees and end-use customers.\nFITTLE has historically offered financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through Xerox indirect dealer channels. At the outset of 2021, FITTLE changed its strategy to broaden its portfolio of assets financed to include numerous growth opportunities independent of Xerox equipment and services, such as the expansion of its dealer relationships to include an increasing number of non-Xerox dealers, leveraging its existing dealer relationships to finance a wider breadth of products and forming relationships with new vendors. Additionally, in 2021, FITTLE became the primary equipment lease provider for our XBS business.\nInnovation (known as PARC Innovation, or PARC) includes the scientists and engineers located at our facilities in Palo Alto, Calif.; Webster, N.Y.; Cary, N.C., and Toronto, Canada. PARC is focused on incubating, productizing and commercializing disruptive technology aligned with innovation focus areas such as 3D Printing, Sensors and Services for the IoT, AI and clean tech.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 29\nIn 2021 we also made progress toward our goal of monetizing and strategically diversifying our investments in innovation. In May, we announced the formation of Eloque, a joint venture with the government of Victoria, Australia to commercialize IoT sensor-based technology and services for monitoring the structural health of bridges. In September, we announced the formation of CareAR, in conjunction with a $10 million noncontrolling investment from digital workflow leader ServiceNow, Inc. Although minimal in terms of revenue, we also began commercializing our 3D liquid metal printing technology through the sales and placements of ElemX 3D printing devices.\nFinancial Overview\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the latter part of the third quarter 2021 and throughout the fourth quarter 2021. We expect the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential emergence of new variants, as well as the global supply chain disruption, to delay economic recovery and continue to impact our revenues and margins, with improvements anticipated in the second half of 2022.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various governments enacted various measures to provide aid and economic stimulus directly to companies through cash grants and credits or indirectly through payments to temporarily furloughed employees. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), and certain provisions from that Act were extended as part of the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted in March 2021. Similar pay protection programs were enacted in Canada and Europe that primarily provide direct grants to companies to cover the salary and wages of employees (retained or temporarily furloughed). In 2021, we recognized savings of approximately $34 million from these various government assistance programs as compared to $107 million recognized in 2020.\nEstimated savings were recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services, maintenance and rentals </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development and engineering expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, administrative and general expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Estimated savings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to monitor government programs and actions being implemented or expected to be implemented to counter the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 Operating Results\nTotal revenue of $7.0 billion in 2021 increased 0.2% from the prior year, including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency and an approximate 0.5-percentage point favorable impact from 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. Total revenue for 2021 reflected the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the global product supply and logistics constraints, which limited our ability to fulfill orders and drove an increase in our order backlog in the second half of the year. Total revenue reflected a 1.1% increase in Equipment sales revenue, including a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency, while Post sale revenue was flat, including a 1.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our 2021 revenues as a result of business closures and office building capacity restrictions, the progress of vaccinations and the gradual reopening of workplaces resulted in higher year-over-year page volumes for most of 2021.\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings was as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>B/(W) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(455) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(647) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(456) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted(1) Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(515) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 30\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 of $(455) million decreased $647 million as compared to Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings of $192 million in 2020. The decrease primarily reflected the after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense, non-service retirement-related costs, Restructuring and related costs, net, Income tax expense, and Transaction and related costs, net. These benefits were partially offset by reduced temporary government assistance as well as higher supply chain cost, including higher freight and shipping costs, which accordingly reduced gross profit.\nAdjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 decreased $20 million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting reduced temporary government assistance and higher supply chain cost, including freight and shipping costs, which were only partially offset by lower bad debt expense and Income tax expense. Adjustments in 2021 include an after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), Restructuring and related costs, net and Amortization of intangible assets, as well as non-service retirement-related costs.\nOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $629 million in 2021 as compared to $548 million in 2020. The increase includes the receipt of an upfront prepaid fixed royalty from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. (formerly Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.) of $100 million, and primarily reflects higher cash from working capital2 and lower accrued compensation, partially offset by a lower run-off of finance receivables and higher cash tax payments.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $85 million in 2021, reflecting capital expenditures of $68 million and acquisitions of $53 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of non-core business assets of $44 million. Cash used in financing activities of Xerox Holdings was $1,310 million in 2021, reflecting payments of $518 million on secured borrowing arrangements, partially offset by proceeds of $311 million on a new secured financing arrangement, as well as payments of $888 million for share repurchases and dividend payments of $206 million.\n2022 Outlook\nWe currently expect 2022 revenue to grow to $7.1 billion in actual currency (and remain flat at $7.0 billion at constant currency1). We expect revenue growth in 2022 to be weighted to the second half of 2022 as the supply chain is likely to remain challenged through the first half of the year. Post sale revenue growth is expected to track a return of workers to the office, which we assume will likewise occur in the second half of the year.\nSimilar to revenue, we expect profitability to be weighted to the second half of 2022. We expect gross margin to be negatively affected by supply chain disruption through at least the first half of the year. We began implementing price increases for equipment supplies and services in 2021, which will partially offset elevated shipping and logistic costs. Furthermore, as supply chain conditions and page volumes improve, we expect gross margin to benefit from a more favorable equipment and revenue mix.\nWe are confident in our ability to generate cash and plan to continue our capital allocation policy of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders. We expect 2022 Operating cash flows from continuing operations to be approximately $475 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $75 million. During 2022, we expect to opportunistically make share repurchases utilizing our remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $113 million.\n_____________\n(1)Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2)Working capital, net reflects Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Accounts payable.\nCurrency Impact\nTo understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as \"constant currency\", currency impact\u201d or the impact from currency.\u201d This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate and is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.\nApproximately 40% of our consolidated revenues are derived from operations outside of the U.S. where the U.S. Dollar is normally not the functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation had a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2021 and a 0.2-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2020.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 31\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply various accounting policies. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Xerox Holdings Board of Directors. We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclosed the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, such as revenue recognition for leases, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nAs discussed above (see Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations), during 2021 the Company continued to be impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption required us to continue our increased review of the majority of our estimates to ensure we appropriately considered the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the extent and duration of the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue, the Company's estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates including ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC Topic 842 Leases. We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) on January 1, 2018 and ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842) on January 1, 2019. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition and lease revenue recognition policies. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the revenue related to the following areas involves significant judgments and estimates:\nBundled Lease Arrangements: We sell our equipment direct to end customers under bundled lease arrangements, which typically include the equipment, service, supplies and a financing component for which the customer pays a single negotiated fixed minimum monthly payment for all elements over the contractual lease term. These arrangements also typically include an incremental, variable component for page volumes in excess of the contractual page volume minimums, which are often expressed in terms of price-per-image or page. Lease deliverables include the equipment and financing, while the non-lease deliverables generally consist of the services, which include supplies. Sales made under bundled lease arrangements directly to end customers or through third party leasing companies comprise 42.0% or $664 million of our equipment sales revenue. Revenues under these bundled lease arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. The allocation of revenue among the elements - equipment vs. post sale (service, supplies and financing) - has remained fairly consistent at approximately 25% and 75%, respectively, over the past three years.\nSales to Distributors and Resellers: We utilize distributors and resellers to sell many of our products, supplies and parts to end-user customers. Sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized as revenue when products are shipped to such distributors and resellers. Distributors and resellers participate in various discount, rebate, price-support, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we record provisions and allowances for these programs as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we also record estimates for sales returns and other discounts and allowances when the sales occur. We consider various factors, including a review of specific transactions and programs, historical experience and market and economic conditions when calculating these provisions and allowances. Total sales of equipment, supplies and parts to distributors and resellers were $1,130 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and provisions and allowances recorded on these sales were approximately 25% of the associated gross revenues.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 32\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses is based on an assessment of historical collection experience as well as consideration of current and future economic conditions and changes in our customer-specific collection trends. Our methodology includes an expected loss model that incorporates an assessment of current and future economic conditions.\nWe recorded bad debt provisions of $7 million, $116 million and $46 million in Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses in our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reserves, as a percentage of trade and finance receivables, were 4.3% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 4.8% and 3.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We continue to assess our receivables portfolio in light of the current economic environment and its impact on our estimation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe significant increase in bad debt provision and reserve percentage in 2020, as compared to 2019, was principally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers. In assessing the level of provision and related reserve for 2020, we critically assessed current and forecasted economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time to ensure we objectively included those expected impacts in the determination of our reserve. That assessment resulted in the recognition of a $60 million incremental bad debt provision in the first quarter 2020. This increased provision was primarily related to finance receivables due to their larger balance and long-term nature. In 2021 we recorded approximately $31 million of bad debt reversals reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic environment as well as lower write-offs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the five year period ended December 31, 2021, our reserve for doubtful accounts ranged from 3.0% to 4.8% of gross receivables. Holding all assumptions constant, a 0.5-percentage point increase or decrease in the reserve from the December 31, 2021 rate of 4.3% would change the 2021 provision by approximately $20 million.\nRefer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 7 - Accounts Receivable, Net and Note 8 - Finance Receivables, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our policy with respect to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses.\nPension Plan Assumptions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms in several countries covering employees who meet eligibility requirements. Where legally possible, we have amended our major defined benefit pension plans to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, including our primary U.S. defined benefit plan for salaried employees, the Canadian Salary Pension Plan and the U.K. Final Salary Pension Plan. In certain Non-U.S. plans, we are required to continue to consider salary increases and inflation in determining the benefit obligation related to prior service. Our pension plan in the Netherlands was changed to a Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) plan. From a Company risk perspective, this plan operates just like a defined contribution plan as the Company is only responsible for a contribution for annual benefit accruals under 5-year agreements. Although the Company risk has been mitigated, under U.S. GAAP this plan doesn't meet the definition of a defined contribution plan and therefore is accounted for as a defined benefit plan.\nSeveral statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense, liability and asset values related to our defined benefit pension plans. These factors include assumptions we make about the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, lump-sum settlement rates, the rate of future compensation increases and mortality. Differences between these assumptions and actual experiences are reported as net actuarial gains and losses and are subject to amortization to net periodic benefit cost over future periods.\nCumulative net actuarial losses for our defined benefit pension plans of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 decreased by $661 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increase of the discount rates and the resultant decrease in the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), excess of actual returns over expected returns, the recognition of actuarial losses through amortization and U.S. settlement losses as well as currency. The total actuarial loss at December 31, 2021 is subject to offsetting gains or losses in the future due to both changes in actuarial assumptions and future experience and will be recognized in future periods through amortization or settlement losses.\nWe used a consolidated weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets of 3.9% for 2021, 4.1% for 2020 and 4.6% for 2019, on a worldwide basis. During 2021, the actual return on plan assets was a gain of $504 million as compared to an expected return of $325 million, with the difference largely due to positive equity market returns, the positive impact of decreasing interest rates on our fixed income investments and the impact of our hedging portfolio in the U.S. When estimating the 2022 expected rate of return, in addition to assessing recent performance, we considered the historical returns earned on plan assets, the rates of return expected in the future, particularly in\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 33\nlight of current economic conditions, and our investment strategy and asset mix with respect to the plans' funds. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets we will use in 2022 is 3.9% with no change from 2021.\nAnother significant assumption affecting our defined benefit pension obligations and the net periodic benefit cost is the rate that we use to discount our future anticipated benefit obligations. In the U.S. and the U.K., which comprise approximately 75% of our PBO, we consider yield curves derived from Moody's Aa or better rated Corporate Bonds and U.K. Corporate bonds rated AA by at least one of the main ratings agencies, respectively, in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions. The consolidated weighted average discount rate we used to measure our pension obligations as of December 31, 2021 and to calculate our 2022 expense was 2.1%; the rate used to calculate our obligations as of December 31, 2020 and our 2021 expense was 1.6%. The increase reflects higher interest rates in both U.S. and non-U.S. regions.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table summarizes the estimated impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rate and a 0.25% change in the expected return on plan assets:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Return </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Increase </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Decrease </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Increase </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 Projected net periodic pension cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(365) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne of the most significant and volatile elements of our net periodic defined benefit pension plan expense is settlement losses. Our primary domestic plans allow participants the option of settling their vested benefits through the receipt of a lump-sum payment. We recognize the losses associated with these settlements immediately upon the settlement of the vested benefits. Settlement accounting requires us to recognize a pro-rata portion of the aggregate unamortized net actuarial losses upon settlement. As noted above, cumulative unamortized net actuarial losses were $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, of which the U.S. primary domestic plans, with a lump-sum feature, represented approximately $590 million. The pro-rata factor is computed as the percentage reduction in the projected benefit obligation due to the settlement of a participant's vested benefit. Settlement accounting is only applied when the event of settlement occurs - i.e. the lump-sum payment is made. Since settlement is dependent on an employee's decision and election, the level of settlements and the associated losses can fluctuate significantly from period to period. During the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, U.S. plan settlements were approximately $300 million, $220 million and $355 million, respectively, and the associated settlement losses on those plan settlements were $54 million, $53 million and $93 million, respectively. In 2022, on average, we estimate that approximately $100 million of plan settlements will result in settlement losses of approximately $20 million.\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan costs for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined benefit pension plans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. settlement losses </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined contribution plans(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retiree health benefit plans(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Benefit Plan Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(47) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Excludes U.S. settlement losses.\n(2)The decrease in 2021 and 2020 reflects the Company's decision to suspend and not make the 2021 or 2020 employer matching contribution to our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees. The employer matching contribution is expected to be resumed and provided for in 2022.\n(3)The 2018 U.S. Retiree Health Plan amendment was fully amortized by December 31, 2021. Accordingly, we estimate amortization of prior service credits in 2022 to decrease by approximately $50 million, as compared to 2021.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 34\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan funding for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Defined benefit pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Defined benefit pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined contribution plans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retiree health benefit plans </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Benefit Plan Funding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)The difference between the estimated funding amount and the estimated expense in 2022 of $20 million is due to estimated contributions for our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees expensed in 2022 as earned but which are expected to be contributed in January of 2023.\nThe 2021 U.S. Defined benefit plans contributions did not include any contributions for our domestic tax-qualified defined benefit plans because none were required to meet the minimum funding requirements. There are no contributions required in 2022 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements.\nRefer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding defined benefit pension plan assumptions, expense and funding.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances, etc., that may not be predictable.\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are assessed for realizability and, where applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more-likely-than-not, be realized in the future. We apply judgment in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowances. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, we considered historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Refer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOur valuation allowance (decreased) increased through income tax expense by approximately $(9) million, $25 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were other decreases to our valuation allowance, including the effects of currency, of $(30) million, $(28) million and $(14) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These did not affect income tax expense in total as there was a corresponding adjustment to Deferred tax assets or Other comprehensive income.\nThe following is a summary of gross deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowances for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross deferred tax assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,463 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowance </td> <td> </td> <td>(357) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(396) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(399) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net deferred tax assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,064 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of the examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 35\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $107 million, $115 million and $127 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRefer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to Goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows of acquired customers, development of new offerings, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, as well as estimates of useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to Goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Refer to Note 5 - Acquisitions and Investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the allocation of the purchase price consideration for our acquisitions.\nOur Goodwill balance was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We assess Goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter based on balances as of October 1st, and more frequently on an interim basis if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The application of an interim or the annual Goodwill impairment test begins with the identification of reporting units, which requires judgment. Consistent with the determination that we have one operating segment, we determined that there is one reporting unit and therefore we tested Goodwill for impairment at the Company or entity level.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of Goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. Our review of impairment starts with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than the net book value. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of Goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than its net book value, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than net book value or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we proceed to a quantitative assessment or test of Goodwill.\nIf a quantitative assessment of Goodwill is required, the determination of the fair value of the Company will involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our quantitative Goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the Company's estimates of forecasted future financial performance including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risks unique to the subject cash flows. When performing our market approach, we rely specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenues and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to our entity. The selected multiples consider our entity's growth, profitability, size and risk relative to those of the selected publicly traded companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations impacting revenues, expenses, cash flows and market capitalization in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and continuing to work remotely and in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 36\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the third and fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of these impacts and projections of these impacts on our future operating results, as well as a sustained market capitalization below book value, we elected to utilize a quantitative model for the assessment of the recoverability of our Goodwill balance for our annual fourth quarter 2021 impairment test. After completing our annual impairment test, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the Company - our single segment and reporting unit - had declined below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized an after-tax non-cash impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) related to our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn estimating the fair value of our single reporting unit, our analysis reflected a 75/25 allocation between the income and market approach and the application of a discount rate applied to our projected cash flows of approximately 7.75%. The heavier weighting to the income approach was consistent with the prior year and reflects the inherent limitations of a market comparison. We likewise believe the discount rate applied was reasonable based on the estimated capital costs of applicable market participants and an appropriate company-specific risk premium that reflects current market and industry conditions. We ran sensitivity cases on the discount rate and, although in certain scenarios our fair value declined further, we believe the implied premiums that would be indicated at our estimated fair value are reasonable.\nOur current results and our internal future forecasts clearly indicate that Xerox has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes a recognition that two years into the pandemic, the transition to more remote and hybrid work environments will continue to have an expected impact on the print business as compared to its pre-pandemic levels. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by providing additional digital services and offerings targeted for the hybrid business model. Our business forecasts reflect these developments, including an easing of the supply chain and logistics issues encountered in 2021 and although our operating results are expected to improve, projected revenues and cash flows are not expected to return to the levels achieved prior to the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company is currently pursuing a strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses such as financing, software and innovation to offset and eventually exceed the reduced cash flows from the print business, this strategy carries an increased level of implementation risk consistent with all new business pursuits.\nIn performing its assessment, the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates based on the facts and circumstances that were available as of the reporting date in light of the continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors noted above. However, the determination of fair value includes assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on subjective factors including the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate. If assumptions or estimates used in the fair value calculations change, including assumptions related to future cash flows as well as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain and logistics issues and our ability to initiate management actions to recover from those issues, it may result in a further decline in our estimated fair value and trigger future impairment charges. We will continue to monitor developments in 2022 including updates to our forecasts as well as our market capitalization and an update of our assessment and related estimates may be required in the future.\nSubsequent to our fourth quarter impairment test, we did not identify any triggering events that required an update to the annual impairment test.\nRefer to Note 13 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 37\nRevenue Results Summary\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue for the three years

section.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year, including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency, and an approximate 0.5-percentage point favorable impact from 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. Revenue reflected global product supply logistics constraints which limited our ability to fulfill orders and drove an increase in our order backlog1 in the second half of the year. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected our revenues by limiting office occupancy; however, the progress of vaccinations and the gradual reopening of workplaces resulted in higher year-over-year page volumes for most of the year. Total revenue decreased 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, including a 0.2-percentage point favorable impact from currency and an approximate 1.2-percentage point favorable impact from 2020 partner dealer acquisitions, partially offset by an approximate 0.6-percentage point unfavorable impact from a one-time upfront OEM license fee of $77 million received in the prior year. The decline in revenue primarily reflected the effects the global pandemic on IT spending and office attendance.\nDuring 2021, our business continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The prolonged impact of the virus, including the Delta and Omicron variants, drove many of our customers to delay their plans to return employees to workplaces. We continued to see a correlation between the roll-out of vaccinations and the return of employees to the workplace, and the gradual recovery of our post sale revenues, but page-volume-driven Post sale revenue was lower than anticipated in the beginning of the year. In addition, global supply chain issues, created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an unprecedented level of disruption, leading to shortages and delays in the receipt of our products and third-party IT hardware. Supply chain disruptions resulted in lower than anticipated equipment and IT hardware sales, higher transportation and logistics costs. Continued strength in demand for our equipment led to a nearly 150% increase in our order backlog1. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential emergence of new variants, as well as global supply chain disruptions, to continue to affect our revenues and margins at least through the first half of 2022.\nGeographically, revenue increased in our EMEA region and declined in our Americas region during 2021. In EMEA, we have a larger presence across SMB businesses, which generally recovered faster and showed greater resiliency against pandemic resurgences than larger enterprises. Revenue decreased in our North American operations, which were more significantly impacted by shipping and logistics constraints, which were further amplified by labor shortages within the North American transportation industry. North America also has a higher proportion of large enterprise customers, who are generally experiencing a slower pace of return to workplaces.\n______________\n(1)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be\ninstalled, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT service offerings.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 38\nTotal revenues included the following:\nPost sale revenue\nPost sale revenue primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenues are associated not only with the population of devices in the field, which is affected by installs and removals, but also by the page volumes generated from the usage of such devices and the revenue per printed page. Post sale revenue also includes transactional IT hardware sales and implementation services primarily from our XBS organization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Post sale revenue was flat as compared to the prior year with a 1.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Post sale revenue decreased 22.1% as compared to the prior year with no impact from currency and an approximate 0.8-percentage point unfavorable impact from an upfront OEM license fee in the prior year, excluding the impact of currency.\nPost sale revenue is comprised of the following:\nServices, maintenance and rentals revenue includes rental and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) as well as the post sale component of the document services revenue from our Xerox Services offerings.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, these revenues decreased 2.6% as compared to the prior year, including a 1.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency, the decline at constant currency1 reflected the impact of lower royalty revenue and lower third-party financing commissions (resulting from higher XFS lease penetration of our XBS operations), as well as a lower net population of devices, and higher mix of services with lower per-page revenues, partially offset by modestly higher page volumes corresponding with the gradual reopening of workplaces, and higher IT revenues, driven by higher demand for our offerings, partially offset by IT hardware product constraints.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, these revenues decreased 22.3% as compared to the prior year, including a 0.2-percentage point favorable impact from currency and an approximate 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from the one-time OEM license fee in the prior year. The decline at constant currency1 reflected a lower population of devices (which is partially associated with lower installs in prior and current periods), a competitive price environment and lower page volumes (including a higher mix of lower average-page-volume products) that are worse than pre-COVID-19 decline trends due to the impact of business closures since March 2020. While these revenues are contractual in nature, on average, our bundled services contracts include a minimum fixed charge and a significant variable component based on print volumes.\nSupplies, paper and other sales includes unbundled supplies and other sales.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, these revenues increased 13.1% as compared to the prior year, including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency. This increase at constant currency1 primarily reflected higher supplies and paper revenues consistent with the gradual reopening of workplaces, which drove higher demand. We also saw a marginal improvement in inventories carried by channel partners, as confidence in the recovery continued to moderately improve. Paper revenue increased $18 million in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, these revenues decreased 24.0% as compared to the prior year, including a 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 primarily reflected lower supplies revenues associated with lower page volume trends, partially offset by higher IT revenues from our XBS channel and from recently acquired IT dealers outside of the U.S. The decrease in supplies was significantly impacted by lower sales through indirect channels, as resellers, in response to the lower demand caused by the pandemic, have reduced their inventory purchases to manage liquidity.\nFinancing revenue is generated from financed equipment sale transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Financing revenue decreased 2.2% as compared to the prior year, including a 1.9-percentage point favorable impact from currency, while Financing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 7.4% as compared to the prior year, including a 0.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 reflected a lower finance receivables balance due to run-off of our lease portfolio and lower equipment sales in prior periods. The decline in 2021 also reflected the impact of lower equipment sales in the second half of 2021. However, lease originations increased in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher XFS (renamed FITTLE in 2022) lease penetration from our XBS sales unit.\n_____________\n(1)See \"Currency Impact\" section for description of constant currency.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 39\nEquipment sales revenue\nEquipment revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows: Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>CC % Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Equipment Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entry </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid-range </td> <td> </td> <td>972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>62% </td> <td> </td> <td>63% </td> <td> </td> <td>68% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High-end </td> <td> </td> <td>304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(22.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.4)% </td> <td> </td> <td>19% </td> <td> </td> <td>21% </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.6)% </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\nCC - See \"Currency Impact\" section for description of constant currency.\nEquipment sales revenue increased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year, including a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decrease at constant currency1 in Equipment sales revenue in 2021 reflected the significant adverse impact of product supply constraints (consistent with market-wide shortages of computer chips and resins) and global freight disruptions, which were further amplified by labor shortages within the transportation industry. Demand increased during the year as businesses reopened, resulting in a backlog of orders at the end of 2021 that was nearly 150% higher than the prior year and higher than pre-pandemic levels. The supply chain disruption most significantly impacted the availability of our mid-range and high-end devices, causing a negative mix impact on total Equipment sales revenue. Equipment sales revenue increased in EMEA, as the impact of supply chain disruptions was offset by higher demand from our indirect channels serving SMB, and from large government deals (in Europe and certain developing market regions). Equipment sales revenue decreased in our Americas operations as shipping and logistics disruptions were more prevalent in the U.S. than other markets. We expect supply chain disruptions to affect Equipment sales revenue through the first half of 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Equipment sales revenue decreased 24.2% as compared to the prior year, including a 0.4-percentage point favorable impact from currency as well as the impact of price declines of less than 5%. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our equipment sales revenue during 2020 as a result of business closures and office building capacity restrictions that impacted our customers' purchasing decisions and caused delayed installations. Additionally, our mix of revenues from lower-end black-and-white devices increased as a result of hybrid workplace trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe change at constant currency1 reflected the following:\nEntry\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase as compared to the prior year was driven by higher demand for our lower-end printers and MFPs through our indirect channels primarily in EMEA as well as in the Americas, which included markedly higher installs related to government deals in the developing regions of EMEA. We also saw higher demand for entry devices associated with hybrid work environments. While sales increased across this portfolio, we experienced an unfavorable mix from significantly higher sales of our lower-end black-and-white devices.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher installs of our black-and-white devices in developing regions in EMEA, including large-order government deals in Eurasia, partially offset by lower sales of devices in our indirect channels in EMEA, Latin America and the U.S. affected in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMid-range\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the significant impact of global product supply constraints and freight disruptions that had a more severe effect on our U.S. operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher demand consistent with the gradual reopening of workplaces, as compared to business shutdowns that reduced purchases of office devices in the prior year.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and related office closures, which significantly impacted our sales through indirect channels in the U.S. and Europe, as resellers, in response to lower demand caused by the pandemic, reduced their inventory purchases to manage liquidity, partially offset by strong demand for our PrimeLink and new generation ConnectKey\u00ae devices.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 40\nHigh-end\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease as compared to the prior year primarily reflected the impact of global product supply constraints and freight disruptions, resulting in lower sales of color systems in the U.S., as well as lower sales of larger color production engines, which continued to be depressed as a result of our customers' delayed capital investment decisions. These negative impacts were partially offset by improvement in sales of devices in the lower-end of the range and to SMB customers, as well as higher sales of black-and-white systems corresponding with our customers' refresh cycles.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease as compared to the prior year primarily reflected lower installs of our Versant entry-production systems and iGen production presses, as well as lower installs of our Iridesse production presses in EMEA, which were partially offset by demand for our larger Baltoro cut-sheet inkjet press and higher sales in the U.S. of our continuous-feed color systems.\n_____________\n(1)See \"Currency Impact\" section for description of constant currency.\nRevenue Metrics\nInstalls reflect only new placements of devices (i.e., measure does not take into account removal of devices which may occur as a result of contract renewals or cancellations). Revenue associated with equipment installations may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our services revenues (which are both reported within our Post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers. Installs include activity for Xerox and non-Xerox branded products installed by our XBS sales unit. Detail by product group (see Geographic Sales Channels and Products and Offerings Definitions) is shown below.\nInstalls for the year ended December 31, 2021 were:\nEntry\n\u20227% increase in color multifunction devices reflecting higher installs of color personal devices at the low-end of the portfolio and higher installs of ConnectKey\u00ae devices through our indirect channels in EMEA and North America.\n\u202236% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices reflecting higher activity primarily from low-end devices through indirect channels primarily from developing regions in EMEA, which included large order government deals, and in the Americas.\nMid-Range(1)\n\u20228% increase in mid-range color installs primarily in EMEA, reflecting higher installs of our recently launched new-generation of ConnectKey\u00ae multi-function printers, as well as our PrimeLink entry-production color devices.\n\u20227% increase in mid-range black-and-white installs reflecting higher installs of our recently launched new-generation of ConnectKey\u00ae multi-function devices, as well as our PrimeLink entry production black-and-white devices.\nHigh-End(1)\n\u202212% increase in high-end color installs reflecting primarily growth from our lower-end Versant devices as well as our Iridesse and iGen production systems.\n\u202219% increase in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting higher installs of our Nuvera devices primarily related to cyclical account refreshes in the U.S and EMEA.\nInstalls for the year ended December 31, 2020 were:\nEntry\n\u202221% decrease in color multifunction devices reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey\u00ae devices through our indirect channels in the U.S. and EMEA.\n\u202220% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices reflecting higher activity primarily from sales in the lower end of the portfolio through indirect channels in our developing regions in EMEA and Latin America associated with work-from-home sales programs, partially offset by lower installs through our indirect channels in the U.S.\nMid-Range(1)\n\u202226% decrease in mid-range color installs primarily reflecting lower installs of multifunction color devices partially offset by strong demand for our recently launched PrimeLink entry-production color devices and our new generation of ConnectKey\u00ae multifunction devices.\n\u202222% decrease in mid-range black-and-white installs reflecting in part global market trends, partially offset by strong demand for our recently launched PrimeLink light-production multi-function devices and our new generation of ConnectKey\u00ae multifunction devices.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 41\nHigh-End(1)\n\u202242% decrease in high-end color installs primarily reflecting lower installs of our lower-end Versant devices, along with lower installs of our Iridesse and iGen production systems, partially offset by strong demand for our Baltoro cut-sheet inkjet press and higher installs in the U.S. of our continuous-feed systems.\n\u202213% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting lower installs of our Nuvera devices along with market trends.\n_____________\n(1)Mid-range and High-end color installations exclude FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. digital front-end sales; including FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. digital front-end sales, Mid-range color devices increased 8% and decreased 26% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, while High-end color systems increased 12% and decreased 42% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGeographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions\nOur business is aligned to a geographic focus and is primarily organized on the basis of go-to-market sales channels, which are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services.

explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure.\nPre-tax (Loss) Income Margin\nPre-tax loss margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 of (6.7)% decreased 10.3-percentage points from the pre-tax income margin of 3.6% in 2020. The decrease primarily reflected the non-cash Goodwill impairment charge of $781 million ($750 million after-tax), and the impact of lower adjusted1 operating margin (see below), of 1.3-percentage points, partially offset by lower Restructuring and related costs, net, Transaction and related costs, net and Other expenses, net.\nPre-tax income margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 3.6% decreased 5.5-percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower adjusted1 operating margin (see below), of 6.5-percentage points, as well as higher Amortization of intangible assets and Transaction and related cost, net, partially offset by lower Restructuring and related costs, net and Other expenses, net.\nPre-tax (loss) income margin includes Restructuring and related costs, net, the Amortization of intangible assets, Transaction and related costs, net and Other expenses, net, all of which are separately discussed in subsequent sections. Adjusted1 Operating margin, discussed below, excludes these items. 2021 Adjusted1 Operating margin also excludes the non-cash Goodwill impairment charge of $781 million ($750 million after-tax).\nAdjusted1 Operating Margin\nAdjusted1 operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 5.3% decreased 1.3-percentage points compared to 2020. The decrease primarily reflects an approximate 1.5-percentage point negative impact of supply chain disruptions, including higher shipping and logistics costs, and an unfavorable mix of equipment revenue due to product constraints, as well as a negative 0.4-percentage points from lower royalty revenue from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. Adjusted1 operating margin also reflected an approximate 1.1-percentage point negative impact of lower savings from temporary government assistance and furlough measures, and an approximate 0.7-percentage point unfavorable impact from lower third-party lease commissions and incremental costs associated with investments to support future growth. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an approximate 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from lower bad debt expense due to a higher provision in the prior year, reflecting the expected impact to our trade and finance receivable portfolio from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, cost and expense reductions associated with our Project Own It transformation actions, favorably impacted adjusted1 operating margin.\nAdjusted1 operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 6.6% decreased 6.5-percentage points as compared to 2019. The decrease reflects the impact of lower revenues, primarily as a result of the significant effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and a 0.9-percentage point unfavorable impact due to an increase in bad debt expense of $61 million in the first quarter of 2020 to reflect the expected impact to our customer base and related outstanding trade and finance receivable portfolio as a result of the economic disruption caused by the\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 43\npandemic. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower costs and expenses, which include savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as additional savings from various cost reductions actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. These actions include approximately $107 million from temporary government assistance measures and furlough programs and other reductions in discretionary spending such as near-term targeted marketing programs, the use of contract employees and the temporary suspension of 401(k) matching contributions for the year 2020, as well as lower compensation incentives consistent with lower sales and operating results. The decrease also included an approximate 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from transaction currency and was affected by an approximate 0.7-percentage point unfavorable impact from the one-time OEM license fee received in the prior year.\n_____________\n(1) Refer to Operating Income and Margin reconciliation table in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section.\nGross Margin\nTotal gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 34.1% decreased 3.3-percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting unfavorable impacts of approximately 1.5-percentage points associated with supply chain costs and capacity restrictions (including significantly higher freight and shipping costs and constrained availability of higher margin equipment) and 0.8-percentage points associated with investments to support future growth. The remainder of the decline reflects the impact of lower savings from temporary government assistance and furlough measures, lower royalty revenue from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. and higher mix of services with lower per-page revenues. These headwinds were partially offset by the cost savings from our Project Own It transformation actions.\nTotal gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 37.4% decreased 2.9-percentage points compared to 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of lower revenues (including from our higher margin post sale stream) primarily as a result of the significant effect of the COVID-19 pandemic due to business closures, as well as price promotion programs, and an approximate 0.5-percentage point adverse combined impact from transaction currency and higher tariffs. The decrease was also affected by an approximate 0.6-percentage point unfavorable impact from the one-time OEM license fee received in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by the cost savings from our Project Own It transformation actions, as well as additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including savings of approximately $74 million from temporary government assistance measures and furlough programs and other reductions in discretionary spend such as the use of contract employees and the temporary suspension of 401(k) matching contributions.\nEquipment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 24.2% decreased 3.2-percentage points compared to 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of higher transportation costs and an unfavorable mix of growth in low-end devices associated with product supply constraints, partially offset by higher revenues and favorable transaction currency.\nEquipment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 27.4% decreased 5.2-percentage points compared to 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of lower revenues (primarily as a result of COVID-19-related business closures) as well as the adverse impact of price promotion programs, incremental tariff costs and the 0.6-percentage point unfavorable impact from transaction currency partially offset by cost reductions from Project Own It.\nPost sale gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 37.0% decreased 3.3-percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting lower savings from temporary government assistance and furlough measures, lower royalty revenues and third-party lease commissions and a higher mix of services with lower per-page revenues, partially offset by restructuring savings associated with Project Own It transformation actions.\nPost sale gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 40.3% decreased 2.2-percentage points compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of lower revenues (primarily as a result of COVID-19-related business closures impacting page volumes) and price erosion on contract renewals, partially offset by productivity and cost savings and restructuring savings associated with Project Own It transformation actions, as well as savings from our additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. These actions include approximately $73 million of savings from temporary government assistance measures and furlough programs and other reductions in discretionary spend such as the use of contract employees and the temporary suspension of 401(k) matching contributions. The decrease was also affected by an approximate 0.6-percentage point unfavorable impact from the one-time OEM license fee received in the prior year.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 44\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses (RD&E) Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>R&D </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(54) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sustaining engineering </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total RD&E Expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRD&E as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 4.4% was flat as compared to 2020.\nRD&E of $310 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased $1 million from 2020, primarily reflecting savings from restructuring and productivity as well as benefits from the timing of program development cycles, partially offset by investments in our innovation portfolio.\nRD&E as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 4.4% was 0.3-percentage points higher compared to 2019, as the impact of revenue declines outpaced the rate of cost reductions.\nRD&E of $311 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $62 million from 2019 reflecting savings from Project Own It that enhanced simplification and rationalization in our core technology spend, and other temporary cost actions, as well as the impact from the timing of investments, partially offset by higher spend in our innovation areas.\nSelling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)\nSAG as a percentage of revenue of 24.4% decreased 2.0-percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of an approximate 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from lower bad debt expense due to a higher provision in the prior year to reflect the expected impact to our trade and finance receivable portfolio from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as bad debt reversals in the current year. The remaining decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower selling expenses, as a result of cost savings and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions, and savings from additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic (including reductions in discretionary spend such as near-term targeted marketing programs and employee benefit programs).\nSAG expenses of $1,718 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $133 million lower than 2020, primarily reflecting lower bad debt expenses, as well as cost savings and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions and from additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic (including reductions in discretionary spend such as near-term targeted marketing programs), partially offset by an approximate $30 million adverse impact from translation currency, higher compensation related accruals (corresponding with higher expected operating results) and other investments in the business to support future growth, as well as the impact of lower benefits from temporary government assistance and furlough measures and higher legal expenses and expenses from prior year acquisitions.\nOur bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $7 million decreased $109 million as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the prior year reflecting an approximate $60 million incremental provision to cover estimated write-offs primarily on our finance receivable portfolio from the COVID-19 pandemic, while 2021 reflected finance receivable reserve reductions of approximately $31 million and lower reserves for trade receivables. The 2021 reductions in our finance and trade reserves reflect improvements in the macroeconomic environment as well as lower write-offs. Although actual finance receivable write-offs incurred to date continued to lag expectations, we believe our current reserve position remains sufficient to cover expected future losses that may result from future economic conditions. We continue to monitor developments regarding the pandemic, including business closures and reopenings and mitigating government support actions as well as future economic conditions, and as a result our reserves may need to be updated in future periods. On a trailing twelve-month basis (TTM), bad debt expense was approximately 0.9% percent of total receivables (excluding the 2021 reductions of $31 million), which is consistent with the pre-pandemic trend and reflects the consistent level of reserves subsequent to the first quarter 2020 charge.\nSAG as a percentage of revenue of 26.4% increased 3.4-percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 and included a 0.9-percentage point unfavorable impact due to the increase in bad debt expense of $61 million in the first quarter 2020. The increase also reflected the impact of lower revenues, partially offset by the benefits from cost reductions associated with our Project Own It transformation actions and savings from additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. These actions included approximately $32 million from temporary government assistance measures and furlough programs, and other reductions in discretionary spend such as near-term targeted marketing programs, the use of contract employees and the\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 45\ntemporary suspension of the 401(k) matching contributions, as well as lower compensation incentives consistent with lower sales and operating results.\nSAG expenses of $1,851 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $234 million lower than 2019, reflecting cost savings and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions and from additional cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, as noted above. These savings were partially offset by higher bad debt expense, as well as expenses from recent acquisitions.\nBad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $116 million or $70 million higher than the prior year primarily as a result of the increase in the bad debt provision recorded in first quarter 2020, which reflects the estimated impact on our customer base and related outstanding receivables portfolio as a result of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the increased provision was related to finance receivables due to their larger balance and longer-term nature. During the remainder of 2020, write-offs as well as the bad debt reserves for our trade and finance receivables portfolios were in line with our projections and consistent with future expectations regarding our estimated impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad debt expense of approximately 2.7% percent of total gross receivables on a trailing-twelve-month basis (TTM) was higher than the 2019 trend of less than one percent, reflecting the significant increase in 2020 due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRestructuring and Related Costs, Net\nWe incurred restructuring and related costs, net of $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These costs were primarily related to the implementation of initiatives under our business transformation projects including Project Own It. The decrease in restructuring and related costs in 2020 is partially due to a higher level of asset impairments and severance and related costs in 2019 for employees transferred as part of an outsourcing arrangement. The following is a breakdown of costs:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and severance costs(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments - leased right-of-use assets(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments - owned assets(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual termination costs(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net reversals(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and asset impairment costs </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention related severance/bonuses(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual severance costs(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting and other costs(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Reflects headcount reductions of approximately 400, 1,850 and 1,000 employees worldwide for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)Primarily related to the exit and abandonment of leased and owned facilities, net of any potential sublease income and other recoveries.\n(3)Primarily includes additional costs incurred upon the exit from our facilities including decommissioning costs and associated contractual termination costs.\n(4)Reflects net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. Net reversals for 2021 also include a $4 million gain on the sale of surplus land.\n(5)Includes retention related severance and bonuses for employees expected to continue working beyond their minimum retention period before termination.\n(6)Primarily reflects severance and other related costs associated with employees transferred (approximately 2,200) as part of a shared service arrangement entered into with HCL Technologies.\n(7)Represents professional support services associated with our business transformation initiatives.\n2021 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 25% focused on gross margin improvements and approximately 70% focused on SAG reductions, and the remainder focused on RD&E optimizations. We expect 2022 pre-tax savings of approximately $15 million from our 2021 restructuring actions.\n2020 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 55% focused on gross margin improvements and approximately 45% focused on SAG reductions.\nThe implementation of our Project Own It initiatives as well as other business transformation initiatives is expected to continue to deliver significant cost savings in 2022. While many initiatives are underway and have yet to yield the full transformation benefits expected upon their completion, the changes implemented thus far have improved our cost structure and are beginning to yield longer-term benefits. However, expected savings associated with these\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 46\ninitiatives may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase as well as investments in new processes and systems until the initiatives are fully implemented and stabilized.\nRestructuring Summary\nThe restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2021 for all programs was $44 million, which is expected to be paid over the next twelve months.\nRefer to Note 14 - Restructuring Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.\nTransaction and Related Costs, Net\nTransaction and related costs, net primarily reflect costs from third party providers for professional services associated with certain major and strategic M&A projects. There were no Transaction and related costs, net incurred during 2021 as compared to $18 million incurred in 2020 and $12 million in 2019. Transaction and related costs, net in 2020 primarily related to legal and other professional costs associated with the terminated proposal to acquire HP Inc. in early 2020.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $55 million, $56 million and $45 million, respectively. The increased level of amortization in 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to intangible assets associated with our 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. Additionally, the increase in amortization of $11 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the accelerated write-off of certain XBS tradenames as part of our continued efforts to realign and consolidate this sales unit as part of Project Own It.\nRefer to Note 13 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets.\nWorldwide Employment\nWorldwide employment was approximately 23,300 as of December 31, 2021 and decreased by approximately 1,8001 from December 31, 2020. The reduction resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), a large portion of which is not expected to be backfilled, as well as the impact of organizational changes.\n_____________\n(1)Decrease based on revised headcount at December 31, 2020 of 25,100 from 24,700 due to the change in definition of full-time equivalent\nemployee.\nOther Expenses, Net Table 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-financing interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-service retirement-related costs </td> <td>(89) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on sales of businesses and assets </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency losses, net </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sales of accounts receivable </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation matters </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract termination costs - IT services </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax indemnification from Conduent </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other expenses, net </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-financing interest expense\nNon-financing interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $96 million was $2 million higher than 2020. When non-financing interest expense is combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense of $207 million decreased by $8 million from the prior year period primarily reflecting a lower average debt balance.\nNon-financing interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $94 million was $11 million lower than 2019. When non-financing interest expense is combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense of $215 million decreased by $21 million from the prior year period reflecting a lower average debt balance primarily due to the full-year effect of the 2019 debt repayments that were not refinanced.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 47\nNOTE: For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 both Xerox Holdings and Xerox reported total interest expense of $207 million and $215 million, respectively, however, the amount reported by Xerox includes $80 million and $32 million, respectively, of interest paid to Xerox Holdings on an Intercompany Loan. The Intercompany Loan represents a loan of the net proceeds Xerox Holdings Corporation received from its Senior Notes to Xerox, which was used to repay existing debt of Xerox Corporation.\nRefer to Note 16 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Xerox Holdings Corporation/Xerox Corporation Intercompany Loan, our debt activity and information regarding the allocation of interest expense.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10 million lower than 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower cash balance.\nNon-service retirement-related costs\nNon-service retirement-related costs decreased $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily driven by lower discount rates and higher expected returns on plan assets due to higher asset balances.\nNon-service retirement-related costs decreased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower losses from pension settlements in the U.S. of $53 million, a $40 million decrease compared to 2019.\nRefer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding non-service retirement-related costs.\nGains on sales of businesses and assets\nGains on sales of businesses and assets increased $10 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods, and reflect the sales of non-core business assets in all periods presented.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nDuring fourth quarter 2020 we recorded a $26 million loss associated with the early extinguishment of $1,062 million of the Senior Notes due May 2021. The net loss included the payment of a redemption premium of $24 million as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other debt carrying value adjustments.\nContract termination costs - IT services\nContract termination costs were a $3 million charge in 2020 and a $12 million credit in 2019, both of which are adjustments to a $43 million penalty recorded in 2018 related to the termination of an IT services arrangement. The penalty was associated with a minimum purchase commitment that would not be fulfilled due to the termination of the related IT services arrangement. The adjustments in 2020 and 2019 reflect changes in the estimate regarding the expected spending in the run-off of this terminated IT services arrangement and the amount due under the minimum purchase agreement. The commitment was settled in 2020 for approximately $34 million. The minimum purchase commitment had originally been entered into in connection with the sale of our Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) business in 2015.\nTax indemnification from Conduent\nRepresents an indemnification payment expected to be received from Conduent as part of the settlement of pre-separation unrecognized tax positions related to Conduent when included in our consolidated return. The equal and offsetting charge to this receipt is recorded in Income tax expense, as part of our obligation to pay the taxing authorities.\nIncome Taxes\nThe 2021 effective tax rate was 3.6%. On an adjusted1 basis, the 2021 effective tax rate was 6.5%. Both rates were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the benefits from tax law changes, additional incentives as a result of changes in elections made with the filed tax returns, the decrease in deferred tax valuation allowances as well as the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions. The adjusted1 effective tax rate also reflects partial offsets for the geographical mix of earnings. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax impacts associated with the following charges: non-cash Goodwill impairment, Restructuring and related costs, net,\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 48\nAmortization of intangible assets and non-service retirement-related costs, as described in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\nThe 2020 effective tax rate was 25.4%. On an adjusted1 basis, the 2020 effective tax rate was 26.3%. These rates were higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes, non-deductible items on lower pre-tax income and an increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances partially offset by the impact from various tax law changes. The adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax impacts associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, net, Amortization of intangible assets, Transaction and related costs, net as well as non-service retirement-related costs and other discrete, unusual or infrequent items as described in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\nThe 2019 effective tax rate was 21.8% and included a credit of $35 million related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). On an adjusted1 basis, the 2019 effective tax rate was 26.1%. Both rates were higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes. In addition to excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the adjusted1 effective tax rate excludes the tax impacts associated with the following charges: Restructuring and related costs, net, Amortization of intangible assets, Transaction and related costs, net, non-service retirement-related costs as well as other discrete, unusual or infrequent items as described in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\nXerox operations are widely dispersed. However, no one country outside of the U.S. is a significant factor in determining our overall effective tax rate. The tax impact from these non-U.S. operations on our full-year effective tax rate for 2021 was (0.9)%. Refer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the geographic mix of income before taxes and the related impacts on our effective tax rate.\nOur effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable.\n_____________\n(1)Refer to the Effective Tax Rate reconciliation table in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section.\nEquity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nIn November 2019, Xerox Holdings sold its remaining indirect 25% equity interest in Fuji Xerox, which had been previously accounted for as an equity method investment. Accordingly, our remaining Investment in Affiliates, at Equity largely consists of several minor investments in entities in the Middle East region.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates - Fuji Xerox(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates - continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges included in equity income </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Equity in net income for Fuji Xerox is reported in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax for all years presented.

These impacts were partially offset by other losses, primarily due to unfavorable currency; and iii) $4 million in unrealized gains, net.\nOther comprehensive income attributable to Xerox was $46 million in 2019 and included the following: i) net translation adjustment gains of $62 million reflecting aggregate translation gains of $45 million from the strengthening of most of our major foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar during 2019, as well as a reclassification of $17 million of accumulated translation losses from AOCL into earnings as a result of the divestiture of our investments in FX and XIP; ii) $10 million of net losses from changes in defined benefit plans reflecting net losses of $138 million associated with defined benefit plan changes during 2019, primarily as a result of lower discount rates, as well as other losses of $21 million, primarily due to unfavorable currency. These losses were partially offset by the reclassification of $148 million of accumulated losses from AOCL into earnings as a result of the divestiture of our investments in FX and XIP; and iii) $6 million in unrealized losses, net.\nRefer to our discussion of Pension Plan Assumptions in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A as well as Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding changes in our defined benefit plans. Refer to Note 17 - Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency derivatives and associated unrealized gains and losses.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 50\nNew Business Strategy/Segment Reporting\nIn January 2021 we announced our intention to stand up our Software, Financing and Innovation businesses as separate units by 2022. During 2021, the operations and financial results for these units continued to be primarily managed by and reported in our go-to-market\u201d (GTM) sales channels and we did not have discrete and complete financial information for these new businesses. Accordingly, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) continued to manage the Company's operations, including the products and services from these new units, primarily through the GTM sales channels and as a result, we continued to have one operating and reportable segment.\nBased on our efforts in 2021, as of year-end these new businesses have largely been stood-up as separate units and we will proceed with these efforts in 2022 and provide additional information related to these businesses during the year. Accordingly, as a result of this effort, we will be reassessing our operating and reportable segments in 2022 and a revision of our segment reporting is expected in 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on results of operations and financial conditions.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 51\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur liquidity is primarily dependent on our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations. Additional liquidity is also provided through access to the financial capital markets and through secured borrowings on our finance receivable balances. Our 2021 financial results continued to be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and those impacts are expected to continue at least through the first half of 2022. However, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to manage the business through the economic disruption caused by this pandemic. The following is a summary of our liquidity position:\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1,909 million and $2,691 million, respectively, and apart from restricted cash of $69 million and $66 million, respectively, was readily accessible for use.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $1.8 billion Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, which terminates in August 2022, contains various investment grade covenants at a time when the Company is not investment grade rated. The Company may seek to renegotiate or replace such facility, including reducing the size of such facility, or may determine not to replace such facility at all and may instead pursue other forms of liquidity. Any new credit agreement may result in higher borrowing costs and may contain non-investment grade covenants, such as those that would place greater restrictions on how the Company can run its businesses and/or limit the Company from taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to the Company and/or its shareholders, customers, suppliers, partners and/or lenders.\n\u2022We continue to focus our efforts on incremental actions to prioritize and preserve cash as we manage through the pandemic.\n\u2022We expect operating cash flows from continuing operations to be approximately $475 million in 2022, reflecting increased investment across each of our new businesses as well as the absence of the upfront prepaid fixed royalty from FX of $100 million. Additionally, we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $75 million.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(696) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(785) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(246) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(161) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,233) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(246) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,394) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(1,310) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,834) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(894) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>(782) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(104) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(678) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,751) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year </td> <td>2,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(104) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at End of Year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(782) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(104) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $629 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $81 million increase in operating cash from 2020 was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$211 million decrease in pre-tax income before depreciation and amortization, provisions, goodwill impairment, restructuring and related costs, net and defined benefit pension costs.\n\u2022$241 million increase from accounts payable primarily due to higher spending as compared to the prior year and the timing of supplier and vendor payments.\n\u2022$222 million increase from inventory primarily due to significant cash usage in 2020 as inventory levels increased because of lower demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 52\n\u2022$136 million increase in other current and long-term liabilities, reflecting higher accruals from the increased level of operations as compared to the prior year.\n\u2022$94 million increase from accrued compensation primarily related to higher employee incentive accruals and year-over-year timing of employee incentive payments.\n\u2022$57 million net increase primarily due to the receipt of an upfront prepaid fixed royalty from FX of $100 million for their continued use of the Xerox brand trademark subsequent to the termination of our technology agreement with them.\n\u2022$22 million increase primarily due to lower payments for restructuring and related costs.\n\u2022$328 million decrease from accounts receivable primarily due to a lower year-over-year decline in revenues as well as the timing of collections.\n\u2022$163 million decrease from a lower net run-off of finance receivables due to an increased level of direct lease originations from our XBS sales unit as well as higher equipment sales.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $696 million decrease in operating cash from 2019 was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$729 million decrease in pre-tax income before depreciation and amortization, provisions, gain on sales of businesses and assets, restructuring and related costs, net, defined benefit pension costs and loss on early extinguishment of debt.\n\u2022$243 million decrease from higher levels of inventory primarily due to lower sales volume.\n\u2022$147 million decrease in other current and long-term liabilities, reflecting lower accruals, particularly incentive-related payments associated with our direct channel partners and decrease in deferred revenue reflecting lower sales activity.\n\u2022$95 million decrease from accrued compensation primarily due to decreased spending and the year-over-year timing of payments.\n\u2022$76 million decrease from lower accounts payable primarily related to lower inventory and other spending partially offset by the timing of supplier and vendor payments.\n\u2022$359 million increase from accounts receivable primarily due to lower revenue and the timing of invoicing and collections.\n\u2022$117 million increase primarily related to a higher level of net run-off due to lower originations of finance receivables of $82 million and lower equipment on operating leases of $35 million.\n\u2022$57 million increase from net taxes primarily due to lower payments in 2020 as a result of lower pre-tax income.\n\u2022$51 million increase primarily due to lower payments for restructuring and related costs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for Xerox Holdings was $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $161 million change in cash from 2020 was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$150 million change due to three acquisitions completed in the current year for $53 million as compared to five acquisitions in the prior year for $203 million.\n\u2022$11 million increase due to proceeds from the sales of non-core business assets of $38 million in the current year as compared to $27 million in the prior year.\n\u2022Other investing, net of Xerox Holdings includes $8 million of noncontrolling investments as part of our corporate venture capital fund.\nNet cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Hedge accounting requires hedged debt instruments to be reported inclusive of any fair value adjustment.\nRefer to Note 16 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt activity.\nCredit Rating Downgrade\nAs a result of the downgrade of our debt ratings in February 2022 by one of the rating agencies, the coupon rate on our $1.0 billion Senior Notes due 2023 of 4.375% will increase by 0.25% to 4.625% effective March 15, 2022.\nFinance Assets and Related Debt\nWe provide lease equipment financing to our customers. Our lease contracts permit customers to pay for equipment over time rather than at the date of installation. Our investment in these contracts is reflected in total finance assets, net. We primarily fund our customer financing activity through cash generated from operations, cash on hand, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and proceeds from capital markets offerings.\nWe have arrangements, in certain international countries and domestically, with our small and mid-sized customers in which third-party financial institutions independently provide lease financing directly to our customers, on a non-recourse basis to Xerox. In these arrangements, we sell and transfer title of the equipment to these financial institutions. Generally, we have no continuing ownership rights in the equipment subsequent to its sale; therefore, the unrelated third-party finance receivable and debt are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following represents our total finance assets, net associated with our lease and finance operations:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total finance receivables, net(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,165 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment on operating leases, net </td> <td> </td> <td>253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Finance assets, net (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,461 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1)Includes (i) Billed portion of finance receivables, net, (ii) Finance receivables, net and (iii) Finance receivables due after one year, net as included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)The change from December 31, 2020 includes a decrease of $74 million due to currency.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 55\nOur lease contracts permit customers to pay for equipment over time rather than at the date of installation; therefore, we maintain a certain level of debt (that we refer to as financing debt) to support our investment in these lease contracts, which are reflected in Total finance receivables, net. For this financing aspect of our business, we maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our finance assets. Approximately 35% of our Total Finance assets, net balance at December 31, 2021 include indirect lease financing primarily provided to end-user customers who purchased equipment sold through distributors, resellers and dealers.\nBased on this leverage, the following represents the breakdown of total debt between financing debt and core debt: Table 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,769 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment on operating leases debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>259 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,028 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core debt </td> <td> </td> <td>1,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,416 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,444 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Finance receivables debt is the basis for our calculation of Cost of financing\u201d expense in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nAt December 31, 2021, leverage was assessed against the Total Debt of Xerox Holdings Corporation and Xerox Corporation since the debt held by Xerox Holdings Corporation is guaranteed by Xerox Corporation and the funds from that borrowing were contributed in full by Xerox Holdings Corporation to Xerox Corporation. In 2022, we expect to continue leveraging our finance assets on a Total Debt basis at an assumed 7:1 ratio of debt to equity.\nCapital Market/Debt Activity\nDuring 2021 we received $311 million from a secured financing arrangement. The secured loan was an amendment of the July 2020 secured borrowing with the same financial institution, which had a remaining balance of $136 million, and we received the incremental net cash.\nRefer to Note 16 - Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt activity, as well as Note 27 - Subsequent Events in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our secured financing arrangements.\nFinancial Instruments\nRefer to Note 17 - Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSales of Accounts Receivable\nThe net impact from the sales of accounts receivable on reported net cash flows is summarized below:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated (decrease) increase to net cash flows(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(41) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Represents the difference between current and prior year fourth quarter accounts receivable sales adjusted for the effects of: (i) the deferred proceeds, (ii) collections prior to the end of the year and (iii) currency.

This program replaced the approximate $450 thousand of authority remaining under Xerox Holdings Corporation's previously authorized $1.1 billion share repurchase program.\nDuring 2021, Xerox Holdings Corporation repurchased 19.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $388 million, including fees. The remaining authorization at December 31, 2021 is approximately $113 million.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 56\nIncluding the shares repurchased under Xerox Holdings Corporation's current and previously authorized share repurchase programs in 2021, Xerox Holdings Corporation repurchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $888 million, including fees.\nDuring 2020, Xerox Holdings Corporation repurchased 15.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $300 million, including fees.\nDuring 2019, Xerox Holdings Corporation repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $300 million, including fees.

The decrease in dividends since 2019 primarily reflects lower shares of common stock outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs.\nAggregate dividends of $14 million were declared on preferred stock in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLiquidity and Financial Flexibility\nWe manage our worldwide liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate, (ii) the legal requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (iii) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services.\nOur principal debt maturities are in line with historical and projected cash flows and are spread over the next five years as follows:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Xerox Holdings Corporation </td> <td> </td> <td>Xerox Corporation </td> <td> </td> <td>Xerox - Other Subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 - Q1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 - Q2 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 - Q3 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 - Q4 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2027 and thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,261 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Represents subsidiaries of Xerox Corporation.\n(2)Includes fair value adjustments.\nLoan Covenants and Compliance\nAt December 31, 2021, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our Credit Facility and Senior Notes.

Our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses, if any, when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We currently do not have, nor do we anticipate, material loss contracts.\nPension and Retiree Health Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans and retiree health plans that require periodic cash contributions. Our 2021 cash contributions for these plans were $135 million for our defined benefit pension plans and $25 million for our retiree health plans.\nIn 2022, based on current actuarial calculations, we expect to make contributions of approximately $135 million to our worldwide defined benefit pension plans and $25 million to our retiree health benefit plans. There are no contributions required in 2022 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of plan assets and discount rates as well as potential legislative and plan changes.\nAt December 31, 2021, the net unfunded balance of our defined benefit pension plans was $119 million, which is a $786 million decrease from the balance at December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to contributions, favorable asset returns and higher discount rates, which lowered the benefit obligation. The $119 million net unfunded position at December 31, 2021 includes the following:\n\u2022$(763) million for certain unfunded plans that by design do not require or allow for advanced funding.\n\u2022$(571) million for under-funded plans, primarily our U.S. tax qualified plans ($512 million under-funded).\n\u2022$1,215 million for over-funded plans, primarily our U.K. plan ($1,044 million over-funded).\nCash contributions to our retiree health plans are made each year to cover medical claims costs incurred during the year. The amounts reported in the above table as retiree health payments represent our estimate of future benefit payments. Our retiree health benefit plans are non-funded and are primarily related to domestic operations. The unfunded balance of our retiree health plans of $303 million at December 31, 2021 decreased $67 million from the balance at December 31, 2020 primarily due to a plan amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health plan, which reduced future benefits and the benefit obligation by approximately $50 million, as well as benefit payments and higher discount rates.\nRefer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health plans.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 58\nFUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp.\nAs previously disclosed, in November 2019, Xerox Holdings completed the sale of its indirect 25% equity interest in Fuji Xerox (now known as FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp.). However, arrangements with FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. whereby we purchase inventory from and sell inventory to FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. continued after the sale.\nWe purchased products, including parts and supplies, from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. totaling $966 million, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our product supply agreements with FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. are designed to support the entire product lifecycle, end-to-end, including the availability of spare parts, consumables and technical support throughout the time such products are with our customers. Our purchase orders under such agreements are made in the normal course of business and typically have a lead time of three months.\nShared Services Arrangements\nIn March 2019, as part of Project Own It, Xerox entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we transitioned certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions, from Xerox to HCL. This transition was expected to be completed during 2020, however, it sustained some delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is now expected to be finalized by the end of 2021. HCL is expected to make certain ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings. The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a remaining aggregate spending commitment of approximately $829 million over the next 5 years. However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term, or for cause.\nIn July 2021, Xerox entered into an arrangement with Tata Consulting Services (TCS), whereby TCS will provide business processing outsourcing services in support of our global finance organization. This included the transition of all the finance processes currently being provided by HCL. These activities started to transition during the third quarter 2021 and were completed in fourth quarter 2021. The transition does not impact our minimum revenue commitments to HCL and will result in all of our finance business processing outsourcing services being provided by one vendor. TCS will leverage their existing technology and make additional investments as required to consolidate, optimize and automate the supported services with the goal of providing improved service levels and cost savings. The arrangement is initially for 6 years with a total contract value of approximately $163 million. We can terminate the arrangement subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term.\nWe incurred net charges of $207 million and $185 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to these shared services arrangements. The cost has been allocated to the various functional expense lines in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income based on an assessment of the nature and amount of the costs incurred for the various transferred functions prior to their transfer to HCL and TCS.\nBrazil Contingencies\nOur Brazilian operations have received or been the subject of numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes. These tax matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the internal transfer of inventory, municipal service taxes on rentals and gross revenue taxes. We are disputing these tax matters and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and current reserves for those matters deemed probable of loss, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Below is a summary of our Brazilian tax contingencies:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax contingency - unreserved </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Escrow cash deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Surety bonds </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liens on Brazilian assets </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the unreserved portion of the tax contingency, inclusive of any related interest, was primarily related to closed cases and currency, partially offset by interest. With respect to the unreserved tax contingency, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute, as well as additional surety bonds\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 59\nand letters of credit, which include associated indexation. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens on assets would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We are also involved in certain disputes with contract and former employees. Exposures related to labor matters are not material to the financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We routinely assess all these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nAs more fully discussed in Note 21 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement law; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); and other laws and regulations. In addition, guarantees, indemnifications and claims may arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers and non-consolidated affiliates. Nonperformance under a contract including a guarantee, indemnification or claim could trigger an obligation of the Company.\nWe determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Should developments in any of these areas cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $107 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and foreign tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is at various stages and, therefore, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. In addition, certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of credit and net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other offsets, including the indirect benefit from other taxing jurisdictions that may be available.\nRefer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may occasionally utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in our operations (as defined by the SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), Disclosure in Management's Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\u201d). Accounts receivable sales facilities arrangements that we enter into may have off-balance sheet elements. During 2017, we terminated all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe. Refer to Note 7 - Accounts Receivable, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding accounts receivable sales.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we do not believe we have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIn addition, see the preceding table for the Company's contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies and Note 21 - Contingencies and Litigation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies, guarantees, indemnifications and warranty liabilities.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 60\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below in the following tables.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Earnings Measures\n\u2022Net (Loss) income and Earnings per share (EPS)\n\u2022Effective tax rate\nThe above measures were adjusted for the following items:\nRestructuring and related costs, net: Restructuring and related costs, net include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our transformation programs beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our transformation programs are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance.\nAmortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\nTransaction and related costs, net: Transaction and related costs, net are costs and expenses primarily associated with certain strategic M&A projects. These costs are primarily for third-party legal, accounting, consulting and other similar type professional services as well as potential legal settlements that may arise in connection with those M&A transactions. These costs are considered incremental to our normal operating charges and were incurred or are expected to be incurred solely as a result of the planned transactions. Accordingly, we are excluding these expenses from our Adjusted Earnings Measures in order to evaluate our performance on a comparable basis.\nNon-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the service cost elements of our retirement costs, which is related to current employee service as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.\nOther discrete, unusual or infrequent items: We excluded the following items given their discrete, unusual or infrequent nature and their impact on our results for the period:\n\u2022Non-cash Goodwill impairment charge.\n\u2022Losses on early extinguishment of debt.\n\u2022Contract termination costs - IT services.\n\u2022Impacts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted in December 2017.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 61\nWe believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Margin\nWe calculate and utilize adjusted operating income and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax (loss) income and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted above as adjustments for our adjusted earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.\nConstant Currency (CC)\nRefer to the Currency Impact section in the MD&A for discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth.\nSummary\nManagement believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period's results against the corresponding prior period's results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThroughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) that follows, references to \"Xerox Holdings\" refer to Xerox Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, while references to \"Xerox\" refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to we,\u201d \"us,\" our,\u201d or the Company,\u201d refer collectively to both Xerox Holdings and Xerox unless the context suggests otherwise. References to Xerox Holdings Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries. References to Xerox Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone company and do not include subsidiaries.\nCurrently, Xerox Holdings' primary direct operating subsidiary is Xerox and Xerox reflects nearly all of Xerox Holdings' operations. Accordingly, the following MD&A primarily focuses on the operations of Xerox and is intended to help the reader understand Xerox's business and its results of operations and financial condition. Throughout this combined Form 10-K, references are made to various notes in the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Part II, Item 8 of this combined Form 10-K, and the information contained in such notes is incorporated by reference into the MD&A in the places where such references are made.\nXerox Holdings' other direct subsidiary is Xerox Ventures LLC, which was established in 2021 solely to invest in startups and early/mid-stage growth companies aligned with the Company's innovation focus areas and targeted adjacencies. Xerox Ventures LLC had investments of approximately $8 million at December 31, 2021. Due to its immaterial nature, and for ease of discussion, Xerox Ventures LLC's results are included within the following discussion.\nExecutive Overview\nOur expectation entering 2021 was that in-office work would normalize following 2020's wave of COVID-19 infections and the global rollout of effective vaccines. However, the emergence of various variants of COVID-19 in 2021 resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to the workplace and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact resulted in a reduction in expected Post sale revenue and profits. In the second half of the year, we also experienced an unprecedented level of supply chain disruption, in part due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with conditions deteriorating throughout the final two quarters of the year. These disruptions resulted in revenue falling below expectations for the year, with most of the shortfall comprised of high-margin mid-range devices and Post sale revenue. Supply chain disruptions also drove an increase in our backlog1 of equipment and IT hardware to nearly $350 million, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than at the end of 2020. We continue to streamline and optimize our operations and exceeded our target Project Own It savings of $375 million in 2021.\nAs we head into 2022, demand for our equipment remains strong as evidenced by our backlog1 of approximately $350 million as of year-end, which is primarily comprised of high-margin office equipment. We expect to have an elevated backlog1 at least through the first half of the year. As the backlog1 clears, our equipment revenue mix is expected to improve, which should result in improvements in gross margin. We also expect that there will be a broader return of workers to the office in the second half of 2022 and for Xerox, the correlation between return-to-work trends, page volumes, and post sale revenues remains strong, which suggests employees print when they return to the office and clients continue to value our printing services.\nAlthough our financial results are expected to improve in 2022, our earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2021 includes an after-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) or $4.38 and $4.08 per share, respectively. This charge largely reflects the impact that the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the Xerox print business. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by growth of our digital services and offerings targeted for hybrid work business models. Additionally, the Company is currently pursuing its strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses, such as financing, software and innovation to offset and, eventually, exceed reduced cash flows from the print business, but this strategy will take time to develop. Refer to the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A as well as Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Financial Overview for further discussion regarding additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in 2021 and 2020.\n_____________\n(1)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT services offerings.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 27\nBusiness Overview\nWith annual revenues of approximately $7.0 billion, we remain a leading global provider of digital print technology and related services, software and solutions. Our primary offerings span four main areas: Workplace Solutions, Production Solutions, Xerox Services and FITTLE. We disclosed at our Investor Conference on February 23, 2022, that we have rebranded our Xerox Financial Services (XFS) business, which is now known as FITTLE.\n\u2022Workplace Solutions includes two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, much of which share common solutions, apps and ConnectKey\u00ae software. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products (captured primarily as equipment sales) as well as the supplies and associated technical services and the financing of those products through FITTLE (captured as post sale revenue).\n\u2022Production Solutions are designed for customers in the graphic communications, in-plant and production print environments with high-volume printing requirements.\n\u2022Xerox Services includes a continuum of solutions and services that helps our customers optimize their print and communications infrastructure, apply automation and simplification to maximize productivity, and ensure the highest levels of security. Our primary offerings in this area are Managed Print Services (MPS), Capture & Content Services (CCS) and Customer Engagement Services (CES) as well as IT Services. CCS and CES encompass a range of Digital Services that leverage our software capabilities in Workflow Automation, Personalization and Communication Software, Content Management Solutions, and Digitization Services.\n\u2022FITTLE (formerly XFS) is a global financing solutions business and currently offers financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through our indirect channels.\nIn addition to our four primary offering areas described above, a smaller but growing portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue, as well as from IT Services, CareAR, which is comprised of DocuShare\u00ae and XMPie, and PARC (Innovation).\nHeadquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, with approximately 23,300 employees, Xerox serves customers in approximately 160 countries. We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to printing production companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2021, approximately 40% of our revenue was generated outside the United States.\nMarket and Business Strategy\nOur market and business strategy is to maintain overall market share leadership in our core market and increase our participation in the growth areas, while expanding into adjacent markets and leveraging our innovation capabilities to enter new markets. The Company's four strategic initiatives, summarized below, remain at the core of how we operate and deliver results for all stakeholders.\n1.Optimize Operations for Simplicity\n\u2022Continuously improve operating efficiency, revenue flow-through and return on assets\n\u2022Invest in augmented reality, robotic process automation, business process outsourcing, analytics and system enhancements to drive efficiencies\n2.Drive Revenue\n\u2022Drive increased adoption and utilization of CareAR\n\u2022Scale IT Services and robotic process automation in the SMB market\n\u2022Grow our financing business as a global financing solutions business\n\u2022Expand distribution of digital solutions among existing Print and Services clients\n3.Monetize Innovation\n\u2022Leverage $250 million corporate venture fund to bolster investment and innovation\n\u2022Add value-added equity partners to accelerate development and market penetration\n\u2022Embed PARC's technology into new and existing businesses\n4.Focus on cash flow and increasing capital returns\n\u2022Maximize annual free cash flow1 generation\n\u2022Deploy excess capital for strategic M&A\n\u2022Opportunistic share repurchases\n_____________\n(1)Free cash flow is defined as Operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 28\nPost-sale Based Business Model\nIn 2021, 78% of our total revenue was post-sale based, which includes contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenue streams generally follow equipment placements and provide some stability to our revenue and cash flows. Key indicators of future post sale revenue include installs and related removals of printers and multifunction devices, the number and type of machines in the field (MIF), page volumes (including the mix of pages printed on our MIF, including color devices) and the type and nature of related software and services provided to customers. Post sale revenue also includes transactional IT hardware sales and implementation services primarily from our XBS organization.\nProject Own It\nDuring the second half of 2018, we initiated a transformation project - Project Own It - centered on creating a more effective organization to enhance our focus on our customers and our partners, instill a culture of continuous improvement and improve our financial results through on-going cost reductions and savings. The primary goal of this project is to improve productivity by driving end-to-end transformation of our processes and systems to improve effectiveness and to reduce costs. These efforts are considered critical to making us more competitive and giving us the capacity to invest in growth and maximize shareholder returns. Key opportunities under Project Own It include establishing more effective shared service centers (captive and through our outsource partners), rationalizing our IT infrastructure, reducing our real estate footprint, and improving our supply chain management and the productivity of our supplier base. In 2021, we exceeded our gross savings target of $375 million. Since its inception, total savings from Project Own It are approximately $1.8 billion. We expect to generate approximately $300 million of gross savings in 2022.\nThis project also involves evaluating the sourcing of all of our products to optimize our options. Our approach is to analyze our potential options both by product category and holistically to determine what sourcing makes the most strategic and economic sense.\nIn March 2019, as part of Project Own It, Xerox entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we transitioned certain global administrative and support functions, including selected finance functions, from Xerox to HCL. In July 2021, Xerox entered into an arrangement with Tata Consulting Services (TCS), whereby TCS will provide business processing outsourcing services in support of our global finance organization. This will include the transition of the finance processes currently being provided by HCL.\nWe incurred restructuring and related costs, net of $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to costs incurred to implement initiatives under our business transformation projects including Project Own It. Refer to Restructuring and Related Costs, Net section of the MD&A and Note 14 - Restructuring Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Businesses Strategy\nIn 2021, we stood up three new businesses: CareAR, Xerox Financial Services (now known as FITTLE) and Innovation (PARC). As a result of this effort, we believe we are positioned to begin reporting separate financial and non-financial information for each business in 2022.\nCareAR Holdings (CareAR) is Xerox's newly formed software business and is comprised of: CareAR, Inc., an enterprise augmented reality business Xerox acquired in late 2020; DocuShare\u00ae, a cloud-based content management system; and XMPie, a multi-channel marketing software platform. Together, these software assets combine to provide an AR and AI-driven visual support platform that provides real-time access to expertise for service companies, field service employees and end-use customers.\nFITTLE has historically offered financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through Xerox indirect dealer channels. At the outset of 2021, FITTLE changed its strategy to broaden its portfolio of assets financed to include numerous growth opportunities independent of Xerox equipment and services, such as the expansion of its dealer relationships to include an increasing number of non-Xerox dealers, leveraging its existing dealer relationships to finance a wider breadth of products and forming relationships with new vendors. Additionally, in 2021, FITTLE became the primary equipment lease provider for our XBS business.\nInnovation (known as PARC Innovation, or PARC) includes the scientists and engineers located at our facilities in Palo Alto, Calif.; Webster, N.Y.; Cary, N.C., and Toronto, Canada. PARC is focused on incubating, productizing and commercializing disruptive technology aligned with innovation focus areas such as 3D Printing, Sensors and Services for the IoT, AI and clean tech.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 29\nIn 2021 we also made progress toward our goal of monetizing and strategically diversifying our investments in innovation. In May, we announced the formation of Eloque, a joint venture with the government of Victoria, Australia to commercialize IoT sensor-based technology and services for monitoring the structural health of bridges. In September, we announced the formation of CareAR, in conjunction with a $10 million noncontrolling investment from digital workflow leader ServiceNow, Inc. Although minimal in terms of revenue, we also began commercializing our 3D liquid metal printing technology through the sales and placements of ElemX 3D printing devices.\nFinancial Overview\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the latter part of the third quarter 2021 and throughout the fourth quarter 2021. We expect the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential emergence of new variants, as well as the global supply chain disruption, to delay economic recovery and continue to impact our revenues and margins, with improvements anticipated in the second half of 2022.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various governments enacted various measures to provide aid and economic stimulus directly to companies through cash grants and credits or indirectly through payments to temporarily furloughed employees. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), and certain provisions from that Act were extended as part of the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted in March 2021. Similar pay protection programs were enacted in Canada and Europe that primarily provide direct grants to companies to cover the salary and wages of employees (retained or temporarily furloughed). In 2021, we recognized savings of approximately $34 million from these various government assistance programs as compared to $107 million recognized in 2020.\nEstimated savings were recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income:\n\nWe continue to monitor government programs and actions being implemented or expected to be implemented to counter the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 Operating Results\nTotal revenue of $7.0 billion in 2021 increased 0.2% from the prior year, including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency and an approximate 0.5-percentage point favorable impact from 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. Total revenue for 2021 reflected the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the global product supply and logistics constraints, which limited our ability to fulfill orders and drove an increase in our order backlog in the second half of the year. Total revenue reflected a 1.1% increase in Equipment sales revenue, including a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency, while Post sale revenue was flat, including a 1.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our 2021 revenues as a result of business closures and office building capacity restrictions, the progress of vaccinations and the gradual reopening of workplaces resulted in higher year-over-year page volumes for most of 2021.\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings was as follows:\n\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 30\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 of $(455) million decreased $647 million as compared to Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings of $192 million in 2020. The decrease primarily reflected the after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense, non-service retirement-related costs, Restructuring and related costs, net, Income tax expense, and Transaction and related costs, net. These benefits were partially offset by reduced temporary government assistance as well as higher supply chain cost, including higher freight and shipping costs, which accordingly reduced gross profit.\nAdjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 decreased $20 million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting reduced temporary government assistance and higher supply chain cost, including freight and shipping costs, which were only partially offset by lower bad debt expense and Income tax expense. Adjustments in 2021 include an after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), Restructuring and related costs, net and Amortization of intangible assets, as well as non-service retirement-related costs.\nOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $629 million in 2021 as compared to $548 million in 2020. The increase includes the receipt of an upfront prepaid fixed royalty from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. (formerly Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.) of $100 million, and primarily reflects higher cash from working capital2 and lower accrued compensation, partially offset by a lower run-off of finance receivables and higher cash tax payments.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $85 million in 2021, reflecting capital expenditures of $68 million and acquisitions of $53 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of non-core business assets of $44 million. Cash used in financing activities of Xerox Holdings was $1,310 million in 2021, reflecting payments of $518 million on secured borrowing arrangements, partially offset by proceeds of $311 million on a new secured financing arrangement, as well as payments of $888 million for share repurchases and dividend payments of $206 million.\n2022 Outlook\nWe currently expect 2022 revenue to grow to $7.1 billion in actual currency (and remain flat at $7.0 billion at constant currency1). We expect revenue growth in 2022 to be weighted to the second half of 2022 as the supply chain is likely to remain challenged through the first half of the year. Post sale revenue growth is expected to track a return of workers to the office, which we assume will likewise occur in the second half of the year.\nSimilar to revenue, we expect profitability to be weighted to the second half of 2022. We expect gross margin to be negatively affected by supply chain disruption through at least the first half of the year. We began implementing price increases for equipment supplies and services in 2021, which will partially offset elevated shipping and logistic costs. Furthermore, as supply chain conditions and page volumes improve, we expect gross margin to benefit from a more favorable equipment and revenue mix.\nWe are confident in our ability to generate cash and plan to continue our capital allocation policy of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders. We expect 2022 Operating cash flows from continuing operations to be approximately $475 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $75 million. During 2022, we expect to opportunistically make share repurchases utilizing our remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $113 million.\n_____________\n(1)Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2)Working capital, net reflects Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Accounts payable.\nCurrency Impact\nTo understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as \"constant currency\", currency impact\u201d or the impact from currency.\u201d This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate and is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.\nApproximately 40% of our consolidated revenues are derived from operations outside of the U.S. where the U.S. Dollar is normally not the functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation had a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2021 and a 0.2-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2020.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 31\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply various accounting policies. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Xerox Holdings Board of Directors. We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclosed the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, such as revenue recognition for leases, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nAs discussed above (see Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations), during 2021 the Company continued to be impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption required us to continue our increased review of the majority of our estimates to ensure we appropriately considered the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the extent and duration of the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue, the Company's estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates including ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC Topic 842 Leases. We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) on January 1, 2018 and ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842) on January 1, 2019. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition and lease revenue recognition policies. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the revenue related to the following areas involves significant judgments and estimates:\nBundled Lease Arrangements: We sell our equipment direct to end customers under bundled lease arrangements, which typically include the equipment, service, supplies and a financing component for which the customer pays a single negotiated fixed minimum monthly payment for all elements over the contractual lease term. These arrangements also typically include an incremental, variable component for page volumes in excess of the contractual page volume minimums, which are often expressed in terms of price-per-image or page. Lease deliverables include the equipment and financing, while the non-lease deliverables generally consist of the services, which include supplies. Sales made under bundled lease arrangements directly to end customers or through third party leasing companies comprise 42.0% or $664 million of our equipment sales revenue. Revenues under these bundled lease arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. The allocation of revenue among the elements - equipment vs. post sale (service, supplies and financing) - has remained fairly consistent at approximately 25% and 75%, respectively, over the past three years.\nSales to Distributors and Resellers: We utilize distributors and resellers to sell many of our products, supplies and parts to end-user customers. Sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized as revenue when products are shipped to such distributors and resellers. Distributors and resellers participate in various discount, rebate, price-support, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we record provisions and allowances for these programs as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we also record estimates for sales returns and other discounts and allowances when the sales occur. We consider various factors, including a review of specific transactions and programs, historical experience and market and economic conditions when calculating these provisions and allowances. Total sales of equipment, supplies and parts to distributors and resellers were $1,130 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and provisions and allowances recorded on these sales were approximately 25% of the associated gross revenues.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 32\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses is based on an assessment of historical collection experience as well as consideration of current and future economic conditions and changes in our customer-specific collection trends. Our methodology includes an expected loss model that incorporates an assessment of current and future economic conditions.\nWe recorded bad debt provisions of $7 million, $116 million and $46 million in Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses in our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reserves, as a percentage of trade and finance receivables, were 4.3% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 4.8% and 3.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We continue to assess our receivables portfolio in light of the current economic environment and its impact on our estimation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe significant increase in bad debt provision and reserve percentage in 2020, as compared to 2019, was principally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers. In assessing the level of provision and related reserve for 2020, we critically assessed current and forecasted economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time to ensure we objectively included those expected impacts in the determination of our reserve. That assessment resulted in the recognition of a $60 million incremental bad debt provision in the first quarter 2020. This increased provision was primarily related to finance receivables due to their larger balance and long-term nature. In 2021 we recorded approximately $31 million of bad debt reversals reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic environment as well as lower write-offs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the five year period ended December 31, 2021, our reserve for doubtful accounts ranged from 3.0% to 4.8% of gross receivables. Holding all assumptions constant, a 0.5-percentage point increase or decrease in the reserve from the December 31, 2021 rate of 4.3% would change the 2021 provision by approximately $20 million.\nRefer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 7 - Accounts Receivable, Net and Note 8 - Finance Receivables, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our policy with respect to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses.\nPension Plan Assumptions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms in several countries covering employees who meet eligibility requirements. Where legally possible, we have amended our major defined benefit pension plans to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, including our primary U.S. defined benefit plan for salaried employees, the Canadian Salary Pension Plan and the U.K. Final Salary Pension Plan. In certain Non-U.S. plans, we are required to continue to consider salary increases and inflation in determining the benefit obligation related to prior service. Our pension plan in the Netherlands was changed to a Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) plan. From a Company risk perspective, this plan operates just like a defined contribution plan as the Company is only responsible for a contribution for annual benefit accruals under 5-year agreements. Although the Company risk has been mitigated, under U.S. GAAP this plan doesn't meet the definition of a defined contribution plan and therefore is accounted for as a defined benefit plan.\nSeveral statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense, liability and asset values related to our defined benefit pension plans. These factors include assumptions we make about the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, lump-sum settlement rates, the rate of future compensation increases and mortality. Differences between these assumptions and actual experiences are reported as net actuarial gains and losses and are subject to amortization to net periodic benefit cost over future periods.\nCumulative net actuarial losses for our defined benefit pension plans of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 decreased by $661 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increase of the discount rates and the resultant decrease in the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), excess of actual returns over expected returns, the recognition of actuarial losses through amortization and U.S. settlement losses as well as currency. The total actuarial loss at December 31, 2021 is subject to offsetting gains or losses in the future due to both changes in actuarial assumptions and future experience and will be recognized in future periods through amortization or settlement losses.\nWe used a consolidated weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets of 3.9% for 2021, 4.1% for 2020 and 4.6% for 2019, on a worldwide basis. During 2021, the actual return on plan assets was a gain of $504 million as compared to an expected return of $325 million, with the difference largely due to positive equity market returns, the positive impact of decreasing interest rates on our fixed income investments and the impact of our hedging portfolio in the U.S. When estimating the 2022 expected rate of return, in addition to assessing recent performance, we considered the historical returns earned on plan assets, the rates of return expected in the future, particularly in\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 33\nlight of current economic conditions, and our investment strategy and asset mix with respect to the plans' funds. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets we will use in 2022 is 3.9% with no change from 2021.\nAnother significant assumption affecting our defined benefit pension obligations and the net periodic benefit cost is the rate that we use to discount our future anticipated benefit obligations. In the U.S. and the U.K., which comprise approximately 75% of our PBO, we consider yield curves derived from Moody's Aa or better rated Corporate Bonds and U.K. Corporate bonds rated AA by at least one of the main ratings agencies, respectively, in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions. The consolidated weighted average discount rate we used to measure our pension obligations as of December 31, 2021 and to calculate our 2022 expense was 2.1%; the rate used to calculate our obligations as of December 31, 2020 and our 2021 expense was 1.6%. The increase reflects higher interest rates in both U.S. and non-U.S. regions.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table summarizes the estimated impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rate and a 0.25% change in the expected return on plan assets:\n\nOne of the most significant and volatile elements of our net periodic defined benefit pension plan expense is settlement losses. Our primary domestic plans allow participants the option of settling their vested benefits through the receipt of a lump-sum payment. We recognize the losses associated with these settlements immediately upon the settlement of the vested benefits. Settlement accounting requires us to recognize a pro-rata portion of the aggregate unamortized net actuarial losses upon settlement. As noted above, cumulative unamortized net actuarial losses were $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, of which the U.S. primary domestic plans, with a lump-sum feature, represented approximately $590 million. The pro-rata factor is computed as the percentage reduction in the projected benefit obligation due to the settlement of a participant's vested benefit. Settlement accounting is only applied when the event of settlement occurs - i.e. the lump-sum payment is made. Since settlement is dependent on an employee's decision and election, the level of settlements and the associated losses can fluctuate significantly from period to period. During the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, U.S. plan settlements were approximately $300 million, $220 million and $355 million, respectively, and the associated settlement losses on those plan settlements were $54 million, $53 million and $93 million, respectively. In 2022, on average, we estimate that approximately $100 million of plan settlements will result in settlement losses of approximately $20 million.\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan costs for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\n\n_____________\n(1)Excludes U.S. settlement losses.\n(2)The decrease in 2021 and 2020 reflects the Company's decision to suspend and not make the 2021 or 2020 employer matching contribution to our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees. The employer matching contribution is expected to be resumed and provided for in 2022.\n(3)The 2018 U.S. Retiree Health Plan amendment was fully amortized by December 31, 2021. Accordingly, we estimate amortization of prior service credits in 2022 to decrease by approximately $50 million, as compared to 2021.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 34\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan funding for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\n\n_____________\n(1)The difference between the estimated funding amount and the estimated expense in 2022 of $20 million is due to estimated contributions for our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees expensed in 2022 as earned but which are expected to be contributed in January of 2023.\nThe 2021 U.S. Defined benefit plans contributions did not include any contributions for our domestic tax-qualified defined benefit plans because none were required to meet the minimum funding requirements. There are no contributions required in 2022 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements.\nRefer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding defined benefit pension plan assumptions, expense and funding.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances, etc., that may not be predictable.\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are assessed for realizability and, where applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more-likely-than-not, be realized in the future. We apply judgment in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowances. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, we considered historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Refer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOur valuation allowance (decreased) increased through income tax expense by approximately $(9) million, $25 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were other decreases to our valuation allowance, including the effects of currency, of $(30) million, $(28) million and $(14) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These did not affect income tax expense in total as there was a corresponding adjustment to Deferred tax assets or Other comprehensive income.\nThe following is a summary of gross deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowances for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of the examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 35\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $107 million, $115 million and $127 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRefer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to Goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows of acquired customers, development of new offerings, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, as well as estimates of useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to Goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Refer to Note 5 - Acquisitions and Investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the allocation of the purchase price consideration for our acquisitions.\nOur Goodwill balance was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We assess Goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter based on balances as of October 1st, and more frequently on an interim basis if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The application of an interim or the annual Goodwill impairment test begins with the identification of reporting units, which requires judgment. Consistent with the determination that we have one operating segment, we determined that there is one reporting unit and therefore we tested Goodwill for impairment at the Company or entity level.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of Goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. Our review of impairment starts with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than the net book value. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of Goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than its net book value, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than net book value or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we proceed to a quantitative assessment or test of Goodwill.\nIf a quantitative assessment of Goodwill is required, the determination of the fair value of the Company will involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our quantitative Goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the Company's estimates of forecasted future financial performance including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risks unique to the subject cash flows. When performing our market approach, we rely specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenues and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to our entity. The selected multiples consider our entity's growth, profitability, size and risk relative to those of the selected publicly traded companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations impacting revenues, expenses, cash flows and market capitalization in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and continuing to work remotely and in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 36\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the third and fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of these impacts and projections of these impacts on our future operating results, as well as a sustained market capitalization below book value, we elected to utilize a quantitative model for the assessment of the recoverability of our Goodwill balance for our annual fourth quarter 2021 impairment test. After completing our annual impairment test, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the Company - our single segment and reporting unit - had declined below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized an after-tax non-cash impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) related to our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn estimating the fair value of our single reporting unit, our analysis reflected a 75/25 allocation between the income and market approach and the application of a discount rate applied to our projected cash flows of approximately 7.75%. The heavier weighting to the income approach was consistent with the prior year and reflects the inherent limitations of a market comparison. We likewise believe the discount rate applied was reasonable based on the estimated capital costs of applicable market participants and an appropriate company-specific risk premium that reflects current market and industry conditions. We ran sensitivity cases on the discount rate and, although in certain scenarios our fair value declined further, we believe the implied premiums that would be indicated at our estimated fair value are reasonable.\nOur current results and our internal future forecasts clearly indicate that Xerox has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes a recognition that two years into the pandemic, the transition to more remote and hybrid work environments will continue to have an expected impact on the print business as compared to its pre-pandemic levels. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by providing additional digital services and offerings targeted for the hybrid business model. Our business forecasts reflect these developments, including an easing of the supply chain and logistics issues encountered in 2021 and although our operating results are expected to improve, projected revenues and cash flows are not expected to return to the levels achieved prior to the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company is currently pursuing a strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses such as financing, software and innovation to offset and eventually exceed the reduced cash flows from the print business, this strategy carries an increased level of implementation risk consistent with all new business pursuits.\nIn performing its assessment, the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates based on the facts and circumstances that were available as of the reporting date in light of the continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors noted above. However, the determination of fair value includes assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on subjective factors including the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate. If assumptions or estimates used in the fair value calculations change, including assumptions related to future cash flows as well as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain and logistics issues and our ability to initiate management actions to recover from those issues, it may result in a further decline in our estimated fair value and trigger future impairment charges. We will continue to monitor developments in 2022 including updates to our forecasts as well as our market capitalization and an update of our assessment and related estimates may be required in the future.\nSubsequent to our fourth quarter impairment test, we did not identify any triggering events that required an update to the annual impairment test.\nRefer to Note 13 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 37\nRevenue Results Summary\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThroughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) that follows, references to \"Xerox Holdings\" refer to Xerox Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, while references to \"Xerox\" refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to we,\u201d \"us,\" our,\u201d or the Company,\u201d refer collectively to both Xerox Holdings and Xerox unless the context suggests otherwise. References to Xerox Holdings Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries. References to Xerox Corporation\u201d refer to the stand-alone company and do not include subsidiaries.\nCurrently, Xerox Holdings' primary direct operating subsidiary is Xerox and Xerox reflects nearly all of Xerox Holdings' operations. Accordingly, the following MD&A primarily focuses on the operations of Xerox and is intended to help the reader understand Xerox's business and its results of operations and financial condition. Throughout this combined Form 10-K, references are made to various notes in the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Part II, Item 8 of this combined Form 10-K, and the information contained in such notes is incorporated by reference into the MD&A in the places where such references are made.\nXerox Holdings' other direct subsidiary is Xerox Ventures LLC, which was established in 2021 solely to invest in startups and early/mid-stage growth companies aligned with the Company's innovation focus areas and targeted adjacencies. Xerox Ventures LLC had investments of approximately $8 million at December 31, 2021. Due to its immaterial nature, and for ease of discussion, Xerox Ventures LLC's results are included within the following discussion.\nExecutive Overview\nOur expectation entering 2021 was that in-office work would normalize following 2020's wave of COVID-19 infections and the global rollout of effective vaccines. However, the emergence of various variants of COVID-19 in 2021 resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to the workplace and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact resulted in a reduction in expected Post sale revenue and profits. In the second half of the year, we also experienced an unprecedented level of supply chain disruption, in part due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with conditions deteriorating throughout the final two quarters of the year. These disruptions resulted in revenue falling below expectations for the year, with most of the shortfall comprised of high-margin mid-range devices and Post sale revenue. Supply chain disruptions also drove an increase in our backlog1 of equipment and IT hardware to nearly $350 million, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than at the end of 2020. We continue to streamline and optimize our operations and exceeded our target Project Own It savings of $375 million in 2021.\nAs we head into 2022, demand for our equipment remains strong as evidenced by our backlog1 of approximately $350 million as of year-end, which is primarily comprised of high-margin office equipment. We expect to have an elevated backlog1 at least through the first half of the year. As the backlog1 clears, our equipment revenue mix is expected to improve, which should result in improvements in gross margin. We also expect that there will be a broader return of workers to the office in the second half of 2022 and for Xerox, the correlation between return-to-work trends, page volumes, and post sale revenues remains strong, which suggests employees print when they return to the office and clients continue to value our printing services.\nAlthough our financial results are expected to improve in 2022, our earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2021 includes an after-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) or $4.38 and $4.08 per share, respectively. This charge largely reflects the impact that the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the Xerox print business. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by growth of our digital services and offerings targeted for hybrid work business models. Additionally, the Company is currently pursuing its strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses, such as financing, software and innovation to offset and, eventually, exceed reduced cash flows from the print business, but this strategy will take time to develop. Refer to the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A as well as Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Financial Overview for further discussion regarding additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in 2021 and 2020.\n_____________\n(1)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT services offerings.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 27\nBusiness Overview\nWith annual revenues of approximately $7.0 billion, we remain a leading global provider of digital print technology and related services, software and solutions. Our primary offerings span four main areas: Workplace Solutions, Production Solutions, Xerox Services and FITTLE. We disclosed at our Investor Conference on February 23, 2022, that we have rebranded our Xerox Financial Services (XFS) business, which is now known as FITTLE.\n\u2022Workplace Solutions includes two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, much of which share common solutions, apps and ConnectKey\u00ae software. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products (captured primarily as equipment sales) as well as the supplies and associated technical services and the financing of those products through FITTLE (captured as post sale revenue).\n\u2022Production Solutions are designed for customers in the graphic communications, in-plant and production print environments with high-volume printing requirements.\n\u2022Xerox Services includes a continuum of solutions and services that helps our customers optimize their print and communications infrastructure, apply automation and simplification to maximize productivity, and ensure the highest levels of security. Our primary offerings in this area are Managed Print Services (MPS), Capture & Content Services (CCS) and Customer Engagement Services (CES) as well as IT Services. CCS and CES encompass a range of Digital Services that leverage our software capabilities in Workflow Automation, Personalization and Communication Software, Content Management Solutions, and Digitization Services.\n\u2022FITTLE (formerly XFS) is a global financing solutions business and currently offers financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through our indirect channels.\nIn addition to our four primary offering areas described above, a smaller but growing portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue, as well as from IT Services, CareAR, which is comprised of DocuShare\u00ae and XMPie, and PARC (Innovation).\nHeadquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, with approximately 23,300 employees, Xerox serves customers in approximately 160 countries. We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to printing production companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2021, approximately 40% of our revenue was generated outside the United States.\nMarket and Business Strategy\nOur market and business strategy is to maintain overall market share leadership in our core market and increase our participation in the growth areas, while expanding into adjacent markets and leveraging our innovation capabilities to enter new markets. The Company's four strategic initiatives, summarized below, remain at the core of how we operate and deliver results for all stakeholders.\n1.Optimize Operations for Simplicity\n\u2022Continuously improve operating efficiency, revenue flow-through and return on assets\n\u2022Invest in augmented reality, robotic process automation, business process outsourcing, analytics and system enhancements to drive efficiencies\n2.Drive Revenue\n\u2022Drive increased adoption and utilization of CareAR\n\u2022Scale IT Services and robotic process automation in the SMB market\n\u2022Grow our financing business as a global financing solutions business\n\u2022Expand distribution of digital solutions among existing Print and Services clients\n3.Monetize Innovation\n\u2022Leverage $250 million corporate venture fund to bolster investment and innovation\n\u2022Add value-added equity partners to accelerate development and market penetration\n\u2022Embed PARC's technology into new and existing businesses\n4.Focus on cash flow and increasing capital returns\n\u2022Maximize annual free cash flow1 generation\n\u2022Deploy excess capital for strategic M&A\n\u2022Opportunistic share repurchases\n_____________\n(1)Free cash flow is defined as Operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 28\nPost-sale Based Business Model\nIn 2021, 78% of our total revenue was post-sale based, which includes contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenue streams generally follow equipment placements and provide some stability to our revenue and cash flows. Key indicators of future post sale revenue include installs and related removals of printers and multifunction devices, the number and type of machines in the field (MIF), page volumes (including the mix of pages printed on our MIF, including color devices) and the type and nature of related software and services provided to customers. Post sale revenue also includes transactional IT hardware sales and implementation services primarily from our XBS organization.\nProject Own It\nDuring the second half of 2018, we initiated a transformation project - Project Own It - centered on creating a more effective organization to enhance our focus on our customers and our partners, instill a culture of continuous improvement and improve our financial results through on-going cost reductions and savings. The primary goal of this project is to improve productivity by driving end-to-end transformation of our processes and systems to improve effectiveness and to reduce costs. These efforts are considered critical to making us more competitive and giving us the capacity to invest in growth and maximize shareholder returns. Key opportunities under Project Own It include establishing more effective shared service centers (captive and through our outsource partners), rationalizing our IT infrastructure, reducing our real estate footprint, and improving our supply chain management and the productivity of our supplier base. In 2021, we exceeded our gross savings target of $375 million. Since its inception, total savings from Project Own It are approximately $1.8 billion. We expect to generate approximately $300 million of gross savings in 2022.\nThis project also involves evaluating the sourcing of all of our products to optimize our options. Our approach is to analyze our potential options both by product category and holistically to determine what sourcing makes the most strategic and economic sense.\nIn March 2019, as part of Project Own It, Xerox entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we transitioned certain global administrative and support functions, including selected finance functions, from Xerox to HCL. In July 2021, Xerox entered into an arrangement with Tata Consulting Services (TCS), whereby TCS will provide business processing outsourcing services in support of our global finance organization. This will include the transition of the finance processes currently being provided by HCL.\nWe incurred restructuring and related costs, net of $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to costs incurred to implement initiatives under our business transformation projects including Project Own It. Refer to Restructuring and Related Costs, Net section of the MD&A and Note 14 - Restructuring Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Businesses Strategy\nIn 2021, we stood up three new businesses: CareAR, Xerox Financial Services (now known as FITTLE) and Innovation (PARC). As a result of this effort, we believe we are positioned to begin reporting separate financial and non-financial information for each business in 2022.\nCareAR Holdings (CareAR) is Xerox's newly formed software business and is comprised of: CareAR, Inc., an enterprise augmented reality business Xerox acquired in late 2020; DocuShare\u00ae, a cloud-based content management system; and XMPie, a multi-channel marketing software platform. Together, these software assets combine to provide an AR and AI-driven visual support platform that provides real-time access to expertise for service companies, field service employees and end-use customers.\nFITTLE has historically offered financing for direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements and lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through Xerox indirect dealer channels. At the outset of 2021, FITTLE changed its strategy to broaden its portfolio of assets financed to include numerous growth opportunities independent of Xerox equipment and services, such as the expansion of its dealer relationships to include an increasing number of non-Xerox dealers, leveraging its existing dealer relationships to finance a wider breadth of products and forming relationships with new vendors. Additionally, in 2021, FITTLE became the primary equipment lease provider for our XBS business.\nInnovation (known as PARC Innovation, or PARC) includes the scientists and engineers located at our facilities in Palo Alto, Calif.; Webster, N.Y.; Cary, N.C., and Toronto, Canada. PARC is focused on incubating, productizing and commercializing disruptive technology aligned with innovation focus areas such as 3D Printing, Sensors and Services for the IoT, AI and clean tech.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 29\nIn 2021 we also made progress toward our goal of monetizing and strategically diversifying our investments in innovation. In May, we announced the formation of Eloque, a joint venture with the government of Victoria, Australia to commercialize IoT sensor-based technology and services for monitoring the structural health of bridges. In September, we announced the formation of CareAR, in conjunction with a $10 million noncontrolling investment from digital workflow leader ServiceNow, Inc. Although minimal in terms of revenue, we also began commercializing our 3D liquid metal printing technology through the sales and placements of ElemX 3D printing devices.\nFinancial Overview\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and allowing employees to continue to work remotely or in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the latter part of the third quarter 2021 and throughout the fourth quarter 2021. We expect the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential emergence of new variants, as well as the global supply chain disruption, to delay economic recovery and continue to impact our revenues and margins, with improvements anticipated in the second half of 2022.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various governments enacted various measures to provide aid and economic stimulus directly to companies through cash grants and credits or indirectly through payments to temporarily furloughed employees. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), and certain provisions from that Act were extended as part of the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted in March 2021. Similar pay protection programs were enacted in Canada and Europe that primarily provide direct grants to companies to cover the salary and wages of employees (retained or temporarily furloughed). In 2021, we recognized savings of approximately $34 million from these various government assistance programs as compared to $107 million recognized in 2020.\nEstimated savings were recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services, maintenance and rentals </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research, development and engineering expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, administrative and general expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Estimated savings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to monitor government programs and actions being implemented or expected to be implemented to counter the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 Operating Results\nTotal revenue of $7.0 billion in 2021 increased 0.2% from the prior year, including a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency and an approximate 0.5-percentage point favorable impact from 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. Total revenue for 2021 reflected the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the global product supply and logistics constraints, which limited our ability to fulfill orders and drove an increase in our order backlog in the second half of the year. Total revenue reflected a 1.1% increase in Equipment sales revenue, including a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency, while Post sale revenue was flat, including a 1.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our 2021 revenues as a result of business closures and office building capacity restrictions, the progress of vaccinations and the gradual reopening of workplaces resulted in higher year-over-year page volumes for most of 2021.\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings was as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>B/(W) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(455) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(647) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(456) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted(1) Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(515) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 30\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 of $(455) million decreased $647 million as compared to Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings of $192 million in 2020. The decrease primarily reflected the after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense, non-service retirement-related costs, Restructuring and related costs, net, Income tax expense, and Transaction and related costs, net. These benefits were partially offset by reduced temporary government assistance as well as higher supply chain cost, including higher freight and shipping costs, which accordingly reduced gross profit.\nAdjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox Holdings for 2021 decreased $20 million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting reduced temporary government assistance and higher supply chain cost, including freight and shipping costs, which were only partially offset by lower bad debt expense and Income tax expense. Adjustments in 2021 include an after-tax Goodwill impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax), Restructuring and related costs, net and Amortization of intangible assets, as well as non-service retirement-related costs.\nOperating cash flow provided by continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $629 million in 2021 as compared to $548 million in 2020. The increase includes the receipt of an upfront prepaid fixed royalty from FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. (formerly Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.) of $100 million, and primarily reflects higher cash from working capital2 and lower accrued compensation, partially offset by a lower run-off of finance receivables and higher cash tax payments.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations of Xerox Holdings was $85 million in 2021, reflecting capital expenditures of $68 million and acquisitions of $53 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of non-core business assets of $44 million. Cash used in financing activities of Xerox Holdings was $1,310 million in 2021, reflecting payments of $518 million on secured borrowing arrangements, partially offset by proceeds of $311 million on a new secured financing arrangement, as well as payments of $888 million for share repurchases and dividend payments of $206 million.\n2022 Outlook\nWe currently expect 2022 revenue to grow to $7.1 billion in actual currency (and remain flat at $7.0 billion at constant currency1). We expect revenue growth in 2022 to be weighted to the second half of 2022 as the supply chain is likely to remain challenged through the first half of the year. Post sale revenue growth is expected to track a return of workers to the office, which we assume will likewise occur in the second half of the year.\nSimilar to revenue, we expect profitability to be weighted to the second half of 2022. We expect gross margin to be negatively affected by supply chain disruption through at least the first half of the year. We began implementing price increases for equipment supplies and services in 2021, which will partially offset elevated shipping and logistic costs. Furthermore, as supply chain conditions and page volumes improve, we expect gross margin to benefit from a more favorable equipment and revenue mix.\nWe are confident in our ability to generate cash and plan to continue our capital allocation policy of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders. We expect 2022 Operating cash flows from continuing operations to be approximately $475 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $75 million. During 2022, we expect to opportunistically make share repurchases utilizing our remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $113 million.\n_____________\n(1)Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2)Working capital, net reflects Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Accounts payable.\nCurrency Impact\nTo understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as \"constant currency\", currency impact\u201d or the impact from currency.\u201d This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate and is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.\nApproximately 40% of our consolidated revenues are derived from operations outside of the U.S. where the U.S. Dollar is normally not the functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation had a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2021 and a 0.2-percentage point favorable impact on revenue in 2020.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 31\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply various accounting policies. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies, estimates and related disclosures included herein with the Audit Committee of the Xerox Holdings Board of Directors. We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In instances where different estimates could have reasonably been used, we disclosed the impact of these different estimates on our operations. In certain instances, such as revenue recognition for leases, the accounting rules are prescriptive; therefore, it would not have been possible to reasonably use different estimates. Changes in assumptions and estimates are reflected in the period in which they occur. The impact of such changes could be material to our results of operations and financial condition in any quarterly or annual period.\nAs discussed above (see Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Operations), during 2021 the Company continued to be impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption required us to continue our increased review of the majority of our estimates to ensure we appropriately considered the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the extent and duration of the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue, the Company's estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change.\nSpecific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout the MD&A, where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of the various accounting principles in GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates including ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC Topic 842 Leases. We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) on January 1, 2018 and ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842) on January 1, 2019. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition and lease revenue recognition policies. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the revenue related to the following areas involves significant judgments and estimates:\nBundled Lease Arrangements: We sell our equipment direct to end customers under bundled lease arrangements, which typically include the equipment, service, supplies and a financing component for which the customer pays a single negotiated fixed minimum monthly payment for all elements over the contractual lease term. These arrangements also typically include an incremental, variable component for page volumes in excess of the contractual page volume minimums, which are often expressed in terms of price-per-image or page. Lease deliverables include the equipment and financing, while the non-lease deliverables generally consist of the services, which include supplies. Sales made under bundled lease arrangements directly to end customers or through third party leasing companies comprise 42.0% or $664 million of our equipment sales revenue. Revenues under these bundled lease arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. The allocation of revenue among the elements - equipment vs. post sale (service, supplies and financing) - has remained fairly consistent at approximately 25% and 75%, respectively, over the past three years.\nSales to Distributors and Resellers: We utilize distributors and resellers to sell many of our products, supplies and parts to end-user customers. Sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized as revenue when products are shipped to such distributors and resellers. Distributors and resellers participate in various discount, rebate, price-support, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we record provisions and allowances for these programs as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we also record estimates for sales returns and other discounts and allowances when the sales occur. We consider various factors, including a review of specific transactions and programs, historical experience and market and economic conditions when calculating these provisions and allowances. Total sales of equipment, supplies and parts to distributors and resellers were $1,130 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and provisions and allowances recorded on these sales were approximately 25% of the associated gross revenues.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 32\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses is based on an assessment of historical collection experience as well as consideration of current and future economic conditions and changes in our customer-specific collection trends. Our methodology includes an expected loss model that incorporates an assessment of current and future economic conditions.\nWe recorded bad debt provisions of $7 million, $116 million and $46 million in Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses in our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reserves, as a percentage of trade and finance receivables, were 4.3% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 4.8% and 3.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We continue to assess our receivables portfolio in light of the current economic environment and its impact on our estimation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe significant increase in bad debt provision and reserve percentage in 2020, as compared to 2019, was principally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers. In assessing the level of provision and related reserve for 2020, we critically assessed current and forecasted economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time to ensure we objectively included those expected impacts in the determination of our reserve. That assessment resulted in the recognition of a $60 million incremental bad debt provision in the first quarter 2020. This increased provision was primarily related to finance receivables due to their larger balance and long-term nature. In 2021 we recorded approximately $31 million of bad debt reversals reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic environment as well as lower write-offs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the five year period ended December 31, 2021, our reserve for doubtful accounts ranged from 3.0% to 4.8% of gross receivables. Holding all assumptions constant, a 0.5-percentage point increase or decrease in the reserve from the December 31, 2021 rate of 4.3% would change the 2021 provision by approximately $20 million.\nRefer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 7 - Accounts Receivable, Net and Note 8 - Finance Receivables, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our policy with respect to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses.\nPension Plan Assumptions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms in several countries covering employees who meet eligibility requirements. Where legally possible, we have amended our major defined benefit pension plans to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, including our primary U.S. defined benefit plan for salaried employees, the Canadian Salary Pension Plan and the U.K. Final Salary Pension Plan. In certain Non-U.S. plans, we are required to continue to consider salary increases and inflation in determining the benefit obligation related to prior service. Our pension plan in the Netherlands was changed to a Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) plan. From a Company risk perspective, this plan operates just like a defined contribution plan as the Company is only responsible for a contribution for annual benefit accruals under 5-year agreements. Although the Company risk has been mitigated, under U.S. GAAP this plan doesn't meet the definition of a defined contribution plan and therefore is accounted for as a defined benefit plan.\nSeveral statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense, liability and asset values related to our defined benefit pension plans. These factors include assumptions we make about the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, lump-sum settlement rates, the rate of future compensation increases and mortality. Differences between these assumptions and actual experiences are reported as net actuarial gains and losses and are subject to amortization to net periodic benefit cost over future periods.\nCumulative net actuarial losses for our defined benefit pension plans of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 decreased by $661 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the increase of the discount rates and the resultant decrease in the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), excess of actual returns over expected returns, the recognition of actuarial losses through amortization and U.S. settlement losses as well as currency. The total actuarial loss at December 31, 2021 is subject to offsetting gains or losses in the future due to both changes in actuarial assumptions and future experience and will be recognized in future periods through amortization or settlement losses.\nWe used a consolidated weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets of 3.9% for 2021, 4.1% for 2020 and 4.6% for 2019, on a worldwide basis. During 2021, the actual return on plan assets was a gain of $504 million as compared to an expected return of $325 million, with the difference largely due to positive equity market returns, the positive impact of decreasing interest rates on our fixed income investments and the impact of our hedging portfolio in the U.S. When estimating the 2022 expected rate of return, in addition to assessing recent performance, we considered the historical returns earned on plan assets, the rates of return expected in the future, particularly in\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 33\nlight of current economic conditions, and our investment strategy and asset mix with respect to the plans' funds. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets we will use in 2022 is 3.9% with no change from 2021.\nAnother significant assumption affecting our defined benefit pension obligations and the net periodic benefit cost is the rate that we use to discount our future anticipated benefit obligations. In the U.S. and the U.K., which comprise approximately 75% of our PBO, we consider yield curves derived from Moody's Aa or better rated Corporate Bonds and U.K. Corporate bonds rated AA by at least one of the main ratings agencies, respectively, in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions. The consolidated weighted average discount rate we used to measure our pension obligations as of December 31, 2021 and to calculate our 2022 expense was 2.1%; the rate used to calculate our obligations as of December 31, 2020 and our 2021 expense was 1.6%. The increase reflects higher interest rates in both U.S. and non-U.S. regions.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table summarizes the estimated impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rate and a 0.25% change in the expected return on plan assets:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Return </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Increase </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Decrease </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Increase </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25% Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 Projected net periodic pension cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(365) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne of the most significant and volatile elements of our net periodic defined benefit pension plan expense is settlement losses. Our primary domestic plans allow participants the option of settling their vested benefits through the receipt of a lump-sum payment. We recognize the losses associated with these settlements immediately upon the settlement of the vested benefits. Settlement accounting requires us to recognize a pro-rata portion of the aggregate unamortized net actuarial losses upon settlement. As noted above, cumulative unamortized net actuarial losses were $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, of which the U.S. primary domestic plans, with a lump-sum feature, represented approximately $590 million. The pro-rata factor is computed as the percentage reduction in the projected benefit obligation due to the settlement of a participant's vested benefit. Settlement accounting is only applied when the event of settlement occurs - i.e. the lump-sum payment is made. Since settlement is dependent on an employee's decision and election, the level of settlements and the associated losses can fluctuate significantly from period to period. During the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, U.S. plan settlements were approximately $300 million, $220 million and $355 million, respectively, and the associated settlement losses on those plan settlements were $54 million, $53 million and $93 million, respectively. In 2022, on average, we estimate that approximately $100 million of plan settlements will result in settlement losses of approximately $20 million.\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan costs for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined benefit pension plans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. settlement losses </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined contribution plans(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retiree health benefit plans(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Benefit Plan Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(47) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)Excludes U.S. settlement losses.\n(2)The decrease in 2021 and 2020 reflects the Company's decision to suspend and not make the 2021 or 2020 employer matching contribution to our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees. The employer matching contribution is expected to be resumed and provided for in 2022.\n(3)The 2018 U.S. Retiree Health Plan amendment was fully amortized by December 31, 2021. Accordingly, we estimate amortization of prior service credits in 2022 to decrease by approximately $50 million, as compared to 2021.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 34\nThe following is a summary of our benefit plan funding for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as estimated amounts for 2022:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Defined benefit pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Defined benefit pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defined contribution plans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retiree health benefit plans </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Benefit Plan Funding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\n(1)The difference between the estimated funding amount and the estimated expense in 2022 of $20 million is due to estimated contributions for our U.S. based 401(k) savings plans for salaried employees expensed in 2022 as earned but which are expected to be contributed in January of 2023.\nThe 2021 U.S. Defined benefit plans contributions did not include any contributions for our domestic tax-qualified defined benefit plans because none were required to meet the minimum funding requirements. There are no contributions required in 2022 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements.\nRefer to Note 19 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding defined benefit pension plan assumptions, expense and funding.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. Our provision is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our provision will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events such as audit settlements, tax law changes, changes in valuation allowances, etc., that may not be predictable.\nWe record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are assessed for realizability and, where applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more-likely-than-not, be realized in the future. We apply judgment in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowances. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, we considered historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Refer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOur valuation allowance (decreased) increased through income tax expense by approximately $(9) million, $25 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were other decreases to our valuation allowance, including the effects of currency, of $(30) million, $(28) million and $(14) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These did not affect income tax expense in total as there was a corresponding adjustment to Deferred tax assets or Other comprehensive income.\nThe following is a summary of gross deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowances for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross deferred tax assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,463 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation allowance </td> <td> </td> <td>(357) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(396) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(399) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net deferred tax assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,064 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results. Our ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of the examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate, as well as impact our operating results.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 35\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $107 million, $115 million and $127 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRefer to Note 20 - Income and Other Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to Goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows of acquired customers, development of new offerings, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, as well as estimates of useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to Goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Refer to Note 5 - Acquisitions and Investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the allocation of the purchase price consideration for our acquisitions.\nOur Goodwill balance was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We assess Goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter based on balances as of October 1st, and more frequently on an interim basis if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The application of an interim or the annual Goodwill impairment test begins with the identification of reporting units, which requires judgment. Consistent with the determination that we have one operating segment, we determined that there is one reporting unit and therefore we tested Goodwill for impairment at the Company or entity level.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of Goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. Our review of impairment starts with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than the net book value. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of Goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than its net book value, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company is less than net book value or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we proceed to a quantitative assessment or test of Goodwill.\nIf a quantitative assessment of Goodwill is required, the determination of the fair value of the Company will involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our quantitative Goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the Company's estimates of forecasted future financial performance including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risks unique to the subject cash flows. When performing our market approach, we rely specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenues and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to our entity. The selected multiples consider our entity's growth, profitability, size and risk relative to those of the selected publicly traded companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant effect on the Company's operations impacting revenues, expenses, cash flows and market capitalization in 2021. Although business results improved in the first half of 2021 and the Company was meeting expectations, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants during the year resulted in many of our customers delaying their plans to return employees to workplaces and continuing to work remotely and in a hybrid environment. This impact combined with the global supply chain and logistic issues, created in part by\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 36\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, had a negative effect on the Company's results particularly in the third and fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of these impacts and projections of these impacts on our future operating results, as well as a sustained market capitalization below book value, we elected to utilize a quantitative model for the assessment of the recoverability of our Goodwill balance for our annual fourth quarter 2021 impairment test. After completing our annual impairment test, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the Company - our single segment and reporting unit - had declined below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized an after-tax non-cash impairment charge of $750 million ($781 million pre-tax) related to our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn estimating the fair value of our single reporting unit, our analysis reflected a 75/25 allocation between the income and market approach and the application of a discount rate applied to our projected cash flows of approximately 7.75%. The heavier weighting to the income approach was consistent with the prior year and reflects the inherent limitations of a market comparison. We likewise believe the discount rate applied was reasonable based on the estimated capital costs of applicable market participants and an appropriate company-specific risk premium that reflects current market and industry conditions. We ran sensitivity cases on the discount rate and, although in certain scenarios our fair value declined further, we believe the implied premiums that would be indicated at our estimated fair value are reasonable.\nOur current results and our internal future forecasts clearly indicate that Xerox has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes a recognition that two years into the pandemic, the transition to more remote and hybrid work environments will continue to have an expected impact on the print business as compared to its pre-pandemic levels. Some of this impact is expected to be mitigated by providing additional digital services and offerings targeted for the hybrid business model. Our business forecasts reflect these developments, including an easing of the supply chain and logistics issues encountered in 2021 and although our operating results are expected to improve, projected revenues and cash flows are not expected to return to the levels achieved prior to the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company is currently pursuing a strategy to develop and expand certain expected growth businesses such as financing, software and innovation to offset and eventually exceed the reduced cash flows from the print business, this strategy carries an increased level of implementation risk consistent with all new business pursuits.\nIn performing its assessment, the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates based on the facts and circumstances that were available as of the reporting date in light of the continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors noted above. However, the determination of fair value includes assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on subjective factors including the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate. If assumptions or estimates used in the fair value calculations change, including assumptions related to future cash flows as well as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain and logistics issues and our ability to initiate management actions to recover from those issues, it may result in a further decline in our estimated fair value and trigger future impairment charges. We will continue to monitor developments in 2022 including updates to our forecasts as well as our market capitalization and an update of our assessment and related estimates may be required in the future.\nSubsequent to our fourth quarter impairment test, we did not identify any triggering events that required an update to the annual impairment test.\nRefer to Note 13 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Goodwill.\nXerox 2021 Annual Report 37\nRevenue Results Summary\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue for the three years
