We are developing nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic pruritus, chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, or LID, in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe are conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER, which we refer to as the PRISM trial, in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The PRISM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-arm treatment study that is designed to evaluate the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of nalbuphine ER in approximately 240 patients in the United States and Europe. To date, we have enrolled approximately 45% of the target number of patients. The pace of enrollment has been slower than anticipated primarily due to competition from other clinical trials and slower than planned site start-ups in Europe. We expect to report top-line data from the 14-week blinded treatment period of the PRISM trial in the second half of 2020. Additionally, the protocol for the PRISM trial provides for a sample size re-estimation analysis once 50% of the patients in the trial are evaluable for the primary endpoint. We expect to reach 50% patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2020. Once all of these patients complete the primary efficacy endpoint, the sample size re-estimation analysis will occur. We expect this analysis will occur in mid-2020. If we increase the target number of patients in the trial as a result of the re-estimation analysis, the timing of our report of top-line data may be delayed.\nWe are also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in patients with IPF. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in up to 56 patients with IPF in the United Kingdom. We expect to report top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2020.\nIn addition, we are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of nalbuphine ER in this population. This trial was designed as an open label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single and multiple ascending dose pharmacokinetic trial in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. We completed the single ascending dosing portion of this trial in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. After reviewing the safety and PK data generated to date in the single ascending dose portion of the trial, we believe that these data are sufficient to support further investigation of nalbuphine ER in potential future safety and efficacy studies in patients with relevant liver diseases. We intend to start planning for a Phase 2 trial of nalbuphine ER in patients with pruritus associated with primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. In addition, we intend to use the data from the hepatic impairment study to support a new drug application, or NDA, submission for nalbuphine ER for pruritus in prurigo nodularis.\nWe have written the protocol for a Phase 2 clinical trial for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA in the upcoming months.\nWe are currently focusing our resources on completing the PRISM trial and Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF. We are continuing to prepare to conduct the Phase 2 trials for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and pruritus associated with PBC but plan to prioritize our cash and operational resources on our two lead clinical programs.\nSince commencing operations in 2011, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the clinical development of nalbuphine ER. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, chronic cough in patients with IPF or LID in patients with Parkinson's disease, and we can provide no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\nOn May 9, 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO, and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, our preferred stock then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 10,381,234 shares of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in patients with pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will be required to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the development and validation of our commercial manufacturing process for nalbuphine ER and other development activities, including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for one or more indications or delay our efforts to expand our product pipeline.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAll of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of nalbuphine ER. These expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, consulting costs, contract manufacturing costs and fees paid to clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. We do not allocate our costs by each indication for which we are developing nalbuphine ER, as a significant amount of our development activities broadly support all indications. In addition, several of our departments support our nalbuphine ER drug candidate development program and we do not identify internal costs for each potential indication.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next few years as we pursue our development program, pursue regulatory approval of nalbuphine ER in the United States and Europe and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER. Predicting the timing or the cost to conduct our nalbuphine ER development program and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors including factors outside of our control such as the sample size re-estimation for our PRISM trial. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on our development program. Furthermore, we are unable to predict when or if nalbuphine ER will receive regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere with any certainty.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and other administrative functions, professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services as well as rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Expense on our Term Loan Facility\nIn December 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital, Ltd. and Square 1 Bank under which we borrowed $15.0 million under a term loan, or the Term Loan. The Term Loan accrued interest at a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 7.75% per annum. The Term Loan required interest-only payments until March 2016, which was extended to November 2016. After November 2016, payments on the Term Loan were made monthly in 20 equal installments of principal plus interest. In June 2018, we paid all amounts owed under the Term Loan.\nChange in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\nThe stock purchase agreement under which we sold shares of Series C preferred stock provided for the issuance and sale of our Series C preferred stock in three separate tranches. The tranches represented a free-standing financial instrument under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 480 and required fair value accounting until they were settled. We recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet for the obligations under this financial instrument. We adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized the changes in fair value in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We continued to recognize changes in the fair value of this liability through the closing of the third tranche, which occurred on January 18, 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Obligation for Loan Success Fee\nIn connection with the Term Loan, we entered into the Success Fee Agreement under which we agreed to pay the lenders a Success Fee upon the occurrence of an exit event, as defined in the Success Fee Agreement. We classified this contingent obligation for the Success Fee as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and we adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date. We recognized changes in the fair value of this obligation for the Success Fee in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We recognized changes in the fair value of the obligation for the Success Fee until the Success Fee payment was triggered and paid upon the closing of our IPO in May 2019.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned from money market funds on our cash and cash equivalents.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table

31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in clinical development expenses primarily related to increased activities in several clinical trials including our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, our Phase 2 trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF and our Phase 1b trial in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition, personnel and related expenses increased by $0.3 million as a result of an increase in our employee headcount, and consulting expenses and professional fees increased by $0.3 million as a result of our increased clinical trial activity. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, all of our research and development expenses relate to our development activity for nalbuphine ER.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 68.5%, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million, which we incurred from the issuance of new stock option grants upon the IPO and from expanded operations, an increase in expenses related to being a public company of $1.1 million and an increase in consulting expenses and professional fees of $0.5 million.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to other income, net of $0.6 million from other (expense), net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase primarily reflects the change in fair value of our liability during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the shares of Series C preferred stock purchasable in the second and third tranches of our Series C preferred stock financing as well as increased interest income of $0.8 million due to our larger cash balance following our IPO in May 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Prior to the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement in May 2019, we financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and convertible notes as well as borrowings under the Term Loan. From inception to our IPO, we raised an aggregate of $102.2 million in gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock and convertible notes and borrowed $15.0 million under the Term Loan. As of June 30, 2018, all amounts owed under the Term Loan had been paid in full.\nIn May 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our IPO and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in money market accounts.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,289\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,818\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $23.1 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $26.1 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million and non-cash charges of $1.4 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses, a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase in receivables, and a $0.2 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in accruals related to our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in prurigo nodularis and our Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in IPF. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of vendor invoices. The increase in receivables was primarily due to prepayments made to one of our vendors, which we expect will be paid back to us in the first half of 2020. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to prepayments of our insurance policies. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and changes in fair value of the Success Fee of $0.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, operating activities used $18.3 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $20.5 million and net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.8 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $1.3 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to increases in prepayments under our ongoing research, development and clinical trial work performed by CROs. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $2.1 million expense related to the change in fair value of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used an insignificant amount of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $73.2 million, primarily consisting of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and placement agent fees, of $65.1 million from our IPO and concurrent private placement, and $10.0 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the third tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in January 2019, partially offset by costs relating to our IPO of $1.2 million and payment of the $0.7 million Success Fee.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.6 million, primarily consisting of net cash proceeds of $10.5 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the second tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in August 2018, partially offset by payments of $4.8 million on the Term Loan and $0.5 million of final fees on the Term Loan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will need to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the costs of commercialization activities, including manufacturing capabilities, for nalbuphine ER and other development activities including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, including the results of the sample size re-estimation for our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial that we expect will take place in mid-2020 as well as the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for other serious neurologically mediated conditions, including our ongoing Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF, as well as any future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of indications for which we seek to develop nalbuphine ER or any future product candidates, and their respective development requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and costs of clinical and nonclinical trials and of seeking regulatory approvals, including the costs of supportive clinical studies such as our planned human abuse liability study and our planned Thorough QT studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs associated with the manufacture of necessary quantities of nalbuphine ER or any future product candidate for clinical development in connection with regulatory submissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or for any future product candidates that receive marketing approval, if any, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> subject to receipt of marketing approvals, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or from any future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to identify potential collaborators for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any future product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we acquire or in-license rights to other potential product candidates or technologies, and the terms and timing of any such acquisition or licensing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development activities and establish a commercial infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021.\nWe have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to complete the clinical development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or any other indication. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include grants of security interests on our assets and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, granting liens over our assets, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient capital as and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or abandon our product development programs or commercialization efforts. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our financial statements, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe have entered into agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the recognition of compensation expense, using a fair value based method, for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options. Our determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options with time-based vesting, and is impacted by our common stock price as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected term that options will remain outstanding, expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe have awarded stock options to non-employees for consultancy services. We have adopted new guidance, effective as of January 1, 2018, which requires that non-employee share-based payment transactions be measured at the grant-date fair value and no longer remeasured at the then-current fair values at each reporting date until the stock options have vested.\nThe fair value of an option award is recognized over the period during which the optionee is required to provide services in exchange for the option award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis.\nEstimating the fair value of equity-settled awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require analysis and judgment to develop.\nExpected Term-The expected term assumption represents the weighted average period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the simplified method\u201d for estimating the expected term of the options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility-For all stock options granted to date, the volatility data was estimated based on a study of publicly traded industry peer companies. For purposes of identifying these peer companies, we considered the industry, stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies.\nExpected Dividend-The Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. We currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the equity-settled award.\nThe following assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of awards granted during the periods indicated:\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected life of options (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and interest rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nStock-based compensation expense, is reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized stock-based compensation was $3.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years.\nThe intrinsic value of all outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.9 million based on a common stock fair value of $3.75 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on December 31, 2019.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO in May 2019, the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined at each grant date by our board of directors, with input from management. All options to purchase shares of our common stock were intended to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, on each grant date, we developed an estimate of the fair value of our common stock based on the information known to us on the date of grant, upon a review of any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock, and in part on input from an independent third-party valuation. As is provided for in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we generally relied on our valuations for up to twelve months unless we had experienced a material event that would have affected the estimated fair value of our common stock.\nOur valuations of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019 were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The methodology to determine the fair value of our common stock included estimating the fair value of the enterprise using a market approach, which estimates the fair value of the company by including an estimation of the value of the business based on guideline public companies under a number of different scenarios. The assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock were based on numerous objective and subjective factors, combined with management judgment, including external market conditions affecting the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and trends within the industry; our stage of development; the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock; our financial condition and operating results, including our levels of available capital resources; the progress of our research and development efforts, our stage of development and business strategy; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; general U.S. market conditions; and the lack of marketability of our common stock.\nThe Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, we considered the following methods:\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Option Pricing Method, or OPM-The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In the model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM-Under the PWERM methodology, the fair value of common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Hybrid Method-The hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered an IPO, as the other potential future liquidity event. The equity value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The relative probability of the IPO scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the IPO at each valuation date. In our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that had a similar profile to ours as well as recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate discount rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our early stage of development and other relevant factors, our board of directors determined that the OPM was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for the valuation performed for December 2017, which resulted in our board of directors determining that the fair value of our common stock was $3.33. Following its determination in early 2018 that we should explore a potential IPO, our board of directors determined that the Hybrid Method was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for valuations performed for April 2018, September 2018 and December 2018, which resulted in the fair value of our common stock being $6.65, $9.12 and $9.31, respectively.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, our board of directors applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the weighted-average expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of our common stock has been determined based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced, as necessary, by a valuation allowance when management determines it is more likely than not that some or all of the tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740. We assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total deferred tax assets were $33.3 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards; which totaled approximately $106.8 million at December 31, 2019. Due to our Series A preferred stock financing in December 2012 and the shares we issued in connection with our IPO in May 2019, we were subject to an ownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Code. As a result, our ability to use $91.3 million of these NOL carryforwards is limited. We may experience further ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If a further ownership change occurred, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards might be further limited.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur financial instruments have consisted of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, term loan payable, Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and obligation for loan success fee. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short term nature of those instruments. The fair value of the obligation for loan success fee has been estimated utilizing a probability-weighted income approach, including variables for the timing of the success event and other probability estimates. The fair value of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability has been estimated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of our Series C preferred stock over the purchase price of any outstanding tranches that may be sold pursuant to our stock purchase agreement referred to in -Components of Operating Results-Other Income (Expense), Net-Change in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\u201d.\nCurrent accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The valuation techniques included in the guidance are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions and are classified into the following fair value hierarchy:\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 1-Observable inputs-quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 2-Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities-such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 3-Unobservable inputs-includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the company to develop relevant assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion regarding our commitments and contingent commitments.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act, permits emerging growth companies such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-02 titled Leases, or ASU 2016-02, which requires rights and obligations arising from both operating and capital leases to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and to disclose quantitative and qualitative information about lease transactions (such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases). ASU 2016-02 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\nWe adopted this new guidance as of January 1, 2019, which included an assessment of the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. We utilized the transition practical expedient added by the FASB, which eliminated the requirement that entities apply the new lease standard to the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. We elected to use the package of practical expedients that allowed us to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. We used the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of leases as a single lease component. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset of $379 and related lease liabilities of $424 related to our operating lease commitments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019 (Note 4). The impact of adoption of the new leasing standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The list of changes is comprehensive and many will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial reporting. The changes include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, ASU 2019-12 requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method, requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination, and removes the requirement to allocate the current and deferred tax provision among entities in stand-alone financial statement reporting. ASU 2019-12 also now requires that an entity reflect enacted changes in tax laws in the annual effective rate, and other codification adjustments have been made to employee stock ownership plans. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of ASU 2019-12 is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2019-12 in the first interim period of the year ending December 31, 2020.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the way credit losses on certain financial instruments are estimated. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "- The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are developing nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic pruritus, chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, or LID, in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe are conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER, which we refer to as the PRISM trial, in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The PRISM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-arm treatment study that is designed to evaluate the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of nalbuphine ER in approximately 240 patients in the United States and Europe. To date, we have enrolled approximately 45% of the target number of patients. The pace of enrollment has been slower than anticipated primarily due to competition from other clinical trials and slower than planned site start-ups in Europe. We expect to report top-line data from the 14-week blinded treatment period of the PRISM trial in the second half of 2020. Additionally, the protocol for the PRISM trial provides for a sample size re-estimation analysis once 50% of the patients in the trial are evaluable for the primary endpoint. We expect to reach 50% patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2020. Once all of these patients complete the primary efficacy endpoint, the sample size re-estimation analysis will occur. We expect this analysis will occur in mid-2020. If we increase the target number of patients in the trial as a result of the re-estimation analysis, the timing of our report of top-line data may be delayed.\nWe are also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in patients with IPF. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in up to 56 patients with IPF in the United Kingdom. We expect to report top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2020.\nIn addition, we are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of nalbuphine ER in this population. This trial was designed as an open label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single and multiple ascending dose pharmacokinetic trial in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. We completed the single ascending dosing portion of this trial in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. After reviewing the safety and PK data generated to date in the single ascending dose portion of the trial, we believe that these data are sufficient to support further investigation of nalbuphine ER in potential future safety and efficacy studies in patients with relevant liver diseases. We intend to start planning for a Phase 2 trial of nalbuphine ER in patients with pruritus associated with primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. In addition, we intend to use the data from the hepatic impairment study to support a new drug application, or NDA, submission for nalbuphine ER for pruritus in prurigo nodularis.\nWe have written the protocol for a Phase 2 clinical trial for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA in the upcoming months.\nWe are currently focusing our resources on completing the PRISM trial and Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF. We are continuing to prepare to conduct the Phase 2 trials for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and pruritus associated with PBC but plan to prioritize our cash and operational resources on our two lead clinical programs.\nSince commencing operations in 2011, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the clinical development of nalbuphine ER. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, chronic cough in patients with IPF or LID in patients with Parkinson's disease, and we can provide no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\nOn May 9, 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO, and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, our preferred stock then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 10,381,234 shares of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in patients with pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will be required to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the development and validation of our commercial manufacturing process for nalbuphine ER and other development activities, including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for one or more indications or delay our efforts to expand our product pipeline.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAll of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of nalbuphine ER. These expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, consulting costs, contract manufacturing costs and fees paid to clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. We do not allocate our costs by each indication for which we are developing nalbuphine ER, as a significant amount of our development activities broadly support all indications. In addition, several of our departments support our nalbuphine ER drug candidate development program and we do not identify internal costs for each potential indication.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next few years as we pursue our development program, pursue regulatory approval of nalbuphine ER in the United States and Europe and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER. Predicting the timing or the cost to conduct our nalbuphine ER development program and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors including factors outside of our control such as the sample size re-estimation for our PRISM trial. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on our development program. Furthermore, we are unable to predict when or if nalbuphine ER will receive regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere with any certainty.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and other administrative functions, professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services as well as rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Expense on our Term Loan Facility\nIn December 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital, Ltd. and Square 1 Bank under which we borrowed $15.0 million under a term loan, or the Term Loan. The Term Loan accrued interest at a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 7.75% per annum. The Term Loan required interest-only payments until March 2016, which was extended to November 2016. After November 2016, payments on the Term Loan were made monthly in 20 equal installments of principal plus interest. In June 2018, we paid all amounts owed under the Term Loan.\nChange in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\nThe stock purchase agreement under which we sold shares of Series C preferred stock provided for the issuance and sale of our Series C preferred stock in three separate tranches. The tranches represented a free-standing financial instrument under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 480 and required fair value accounting until they were settled. We recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet for the obligations under this financial instrument. We adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized the changes in fair value in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We continued to recognize changes in the fair value of this liability through the closing of the third tranche, which occurred on January 18, 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Obligation for Loan Success Fee\nIn connection with the Term Loan, we entered into the Success Fee Agreement under which we agreed to pay the lenders a Success Fee upon the occurrence of an exit event, as defined in the Success Fee Agreement. We classified this contingent obligation for the Success Fee as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and we adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date. We recognized changes in the fair value of this obligation for the Success Fee in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We recognized changes in the fair value of the obligation for the Success Fee until the Success Fee payment was triggered and paid upon the closing of our IPO in May 2019.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned from money market funds on our cash and cash equivalents.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $5.3 million, or 37.4%, from $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in clinical development expenses primarily related to increased activities in several clinical trials including our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, our Phase 2 trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF and our Phase 1b trial in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition, personnel and related expenses increased by $0.3 million as a result of an increase in our employee headcount, and consulting expenses and professional fees increased by $0.3 million as a result of our increased clinical trial activity. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, all of our research and development expenses relate to our development activity for nalbuphine ER.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 68.5%, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million, which we incurred from the issuance of new stock option grants upon the IPO and from expanded operations, an increase in expenses related to being a public company of $1.1 million and an increase in consulting expenses and professional fees of $0.5 million.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to other income, net of $0.6 million from other (expense), net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase primarily reflects the change in fair value of our liability during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the shares of Series C preferred stock purchasable in the second and third tranches of our Series C preferred stock financing as well as increased interest income of $0.8 million due to our larger cash balance following our IPO in May 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Prior to the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement in May 2019, we financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and convertible notes as well as borrowings under the Term Loan. From inception to our IPO, we raised an aggregate of $102.2 million in gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock and convertible notes and borrowed $15.0 million under the Term Loan. As of June 30, 2018, all amounts owed under the Term Loan had been paid in full.\nIn May 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our IPO and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in money market accounts.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $23.1 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $26.1 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million and non-cash charges of $1.4 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses, a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase in receivables, and a $0.2 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in accruals related to our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in prurigo nodularis and our Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in IPF. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of vendor invoices. The increase in receivables was primarily due to prepayments made to one of our vendors, which we expect will be paid back to us in the first half of 2020. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to prepayments of our insurance policies. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and changes in fair value of the Success Fee of $0.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, operating activities used $18.3 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $20.5 million and net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.8 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $1.3 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to increases in prepayments under our ongoing research, development and clinical trial work performed by CROs. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $2.1 million expense related to the change in fair value of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used an insignificant amount of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $73.2 million, primarily consisting of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and placement agent fees, of $65.1 million from our IPO and concurrent private placement, and $10.0 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the third tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in January 2019, partially offset by costs relating to our IPO of $1.2 million and payment of the $0.7 million Success Fee.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.6 million, primarily consisting of net cash proceeds of $10.5 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the second tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in August 2018, partially offset by payments of $4.8 million on the Term Loan and $0.5 million of final fees on the Term Loan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will need to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the costs of commercialization activities, including manufacturing capabilities, for nalbuphine ER and other development activities including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, including the results of the sample size re-estimation for our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial that we expect will take place in mid-2020 as well as the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for other serious neurologically mediated conditions, including our ongoing Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF, as well as any future product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of indications for which we seek to develop nalbuphine ER or any future product candidates, and their respective development requirements; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of clinical and nonclinical trials and of seeking regulatory approvals, including the costs of supportive clinical studies such as our planned human abuse liability study and our planned Thorough QT studies; \n \u2022 the costs associated with the manufacture of necessary quantities of nalbuphine ER or any future product candidate for clinical development in connection with regulatory submissions; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or for any future product candidates that receive marketing approval, if any, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approvals, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or from any future product candidates; \n \u2022 our ability to identify potential collaborators for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any future product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates; \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license rights to other potential product candidates or technologies, and the terms and timing of any such acquisition or licensing arrangements; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development activities and establish a commercial infrastructure; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products; and \n \u2022 the costs of operating as a public company. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021.\nWe have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to complete the clinical development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or any other indication. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include grants of security interests on our assets and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, granting liens over our assets, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient capital as and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or abandon our product development programs or commercialization efforts. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our financial statements, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe have entered into agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the recognition of compensation expense, using a fair value based method, for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options. Our determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options with time-based vesting, and is impacted by our common stock price as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected term that options will remain outstanding, expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe have awarded stock options to non-employees for consultancy services. We have adopted new guidance, effective as of January 1, 2018, which requires that non-employee share-based payment transactions be measured at the grant-date fair value and no longer remeasured at the then-current fair values at each reporting date until the stock options have vested.\nThe fair value of an option award is recognized over the period during which the optionee is required to provide services in exchange for the option award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis.\nEstimating the fair value of equity-settled awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require analysis and judgment to develop.\nExpected Term-The expected term assumption represents the weighted average period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the simplified method\u201d for estimating the expected term of the options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility-For all stock options granted to date, the volatility data was estimated based on a study of publicly traded industry peer companies. For purposes of identifying these peer companies, we considered the industry, stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies.\nExpected Dividend-The Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. We currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the equity-settled award.\nThe following assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of awards granted during the periods indicated:\n\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and interest rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nStock-based compensation expense, is reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized stock-based compensation was $3.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years.\nThe intrinsic value of all outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.9 million based on a common stock fair value of $3.75 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on December 31, 2019.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO in May 2019, the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined at each grant date by our board of directors, with input from management. All options to purchase shares of our common stock were intended to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, on each grant date, we developed an estimate of the fair value of our common stock based on the information known to us on the date of grant, upon a review of any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock, and in part on input from an independent third-party valuation. As is provided for in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we generally relied on our valuations for up to twelve months unless we had experienced a material event that would have affected the estimated fair value of our common stock.\nOur valuations of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019 were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The methodology to determine the fair value of our common stock included estimating the fair value of the enterprise using a market approach, which estimates the fair value of the company by including an estimation of the value of the business based on guideline public companies under a number of different scenarios. The assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock were based on numerous objective and subjective factors, combined with management judgment, including external market conditions affecting the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and trends within the industry; our stage of development; the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock; our financial condition and operating results, including our levels of available capital resources; the progress of our research and development efforts, our stage of development and business strategy; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; general U.S. market conditions; and the lack of marketability of our common stock.\nThe Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, we considered the following methods:\n \u2022 Option Pricing Method, or OPM-The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In the model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities. \n \u2022 Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM-Under the PWERM methodology, the fair value of common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. \n \u2022 Hybrid Method-The hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered an IPO, as the other potential future liquidity event. The equity value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The relative probability of the IPO scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the IPO at each valuation date. In our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that had a similar profile to ours as well as recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate discount rate. \nBased on our early stage of development and other relevant factors, our board of directors determined that the OPM was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for the valuation performed for December 2017, which resulted in our board of directors determining that the fair value of our common stock was $3.33. Following its determination in early 2018 that we should explore a potential IPO, our board of directors determined that the Hybrid Method was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for valuations performed for April 2018, September 2018 and December 2018, which resulted in the fair value of our common stock being $6.65, $9.12 and $9.31, respectively.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, our board of directors applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the weighted-average expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of our common stock has been determined based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced, as necessary, by a valuation allowance when management determines it is more likely than not that some or all of the tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740. We assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total deferred tax assets were $33.3 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards; which totaled approximately $106.8 million at December 31, 2019. Due to our Series A preferred stock financing in December 2012 and the shares we issued in connection with our IPO in May 2019, we were subject to an ownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Code. As a result, our ability to use $91.3 million of these NOL carryforwards is limited. We may experience further ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If a further ownership change occurred, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards might be further limited.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur financial instruments have consisted of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, term loan payable, Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and obligation for loan success fee. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short term nature of those instruments. The fair value of the obligation for loan success fee has been estimated utilizing a probability-weighted income approach, including variables for the timing of the success event and other probability estimates. The fair value of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability has been estimated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of our Series C preferred stock over the purchase price of any outstanding tranches that may be sold pursuant to our stock purchase agreement referred to in -Components of Operating Results-Other Income (Expense), Net-Change in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\u201d.\nCurrent accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The valuation techniques included in the guidance are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions and are classified into the following fair value hierarchy:\n \u2022 Level 1-Observable inputs-quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 2-Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities-such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. \n \u2022 Level 3-Unobservable inputs-includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the company to develop relevant assumptions. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion regarding our commitments and contingent commitments.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act, permits emerging growth companies such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-02 titled Leases, or ASU 2016-02, which requires rights and obligations arising from both operating and capital leases to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and to disclose quantitative and qualitative information about lease transactions (such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases). ASU 2016-02 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\nWe adopted this new guidance as of January 1, 2019, which included an assessment of the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. We utilized the transition practical expedient added by the FASB, which eliminated the requirement that entities apply the new lease standard to the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. We elected to use the package of practical expedients that allowed us to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. We used the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of leases as a single lease component. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset of $379 and related lease liabilities of $424 related to our operating lease commitments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019 (Note 4). The impact of adoption of the new leasing standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The list of changes is comprehensive and many will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial reporting. The changes include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, ASU 2019-12 requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method, requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination, and removes the requirement to allocate the current and deferred tax provision among entities in stand-alone financial statement reporting. ASU 2019-12 also now requires that an entity reflect enacted changes in tax laws in the annual effective rate, and other codification adjustments have been made to employee stock ownership plans. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of ASU 2019-12 is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2019-12 in the first interim period of the year ending December 31, 2020.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the way credit losses on certain financial instruments are estimated. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the statements contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We are developing nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic pruritus, chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, or LID, in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe are conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER, which we refer to as the PRISM trial, in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The PRISM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-arm treatment study that is designed to evaluate the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of nalbuphine ER in approximately 240 patients in the United States and Europe. To date, we have enrolled approximately 45% of the target number of patients. The pace of enrollment has been slower than anticipated primarily due to competition from other clinical trials and slower than planned site start-ups in Europe. We expect to report top-line data from the 14-week blinded treatment period of the PRISM trial in the second half of 2020. Additionally, the protocol for the PRISM trial provides for a sample size re-estimation analysis once 50% of the patients in the trial are evaluable for the primary endpoint. We expect to reach 50% patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2020. Once all of these patients complete the primary efficacy endpoint, the sample size re-estimation analysis will occur. We expect this analysis will occur in mid-2020. If we increase the target number of patients in the trial as a result of the re-estimation analysis, the timing of our report of top-line data may be delayed.\nWe are also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in patients with IPF. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of nalbuphine ER for chronic cough in up to 56 patients with IPF in the United Kingdom. We expect to report top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2020.\nIn addition, we are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of nalbuphine ER in this population. This trial was designed as an open label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single and multiple ascending dose pharmacokinetic trial in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. We completed the single ascending dosing portion of this trial in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. After reviewing the safety and PK data generated to date in the single ascending dose portion of the trial, we believe that these data are sufficient to support further investigation of nalbuphine ER in potential future safety and efficacy studies in patients with relevant liver diseases. We intend to start planning for a Phase 2 trial of nalbuphine ER in patients with pruritus associated with primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. In addition, we intend to use the data from the hepatic impairment study to support a new drug application, or NDA, submission for nalbuphine ER for pruritus in prurigo nodularis.\nWe have written the protocol for a Phase 2 clinical trial for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA in the upcoming months.\nWe are currently focusing our resources on completing the PRISM trial and Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF. We are continuing to prepare to conduct the Phase 2 trials for LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and pruritus associated with PBC but plan to prioritize our cash and operational resources on our two lead clinical programs.\nSince commencing operations in 2011, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the clinical development of nalbuphine ER. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, as a result, we have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since commencement of our operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, chronic cough in patients with IPF or LID in patients with Parkinson's disease, and we can provide no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\nOn May 9, 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO, and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, our preferred stock then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 10,381,234 shares of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our future viability beyond that point is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in patients with pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will be required to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the development and validation of our commercial manufacturing process for nalbuphine ER and other development activities, including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for one or more indications or delay our efforts to expand our product pipeline.\nComponents of Operating Results\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAll of our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of nalbuphine ER. These expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, consulting costs, contract manufacturing costs and fees paid to clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. We do not allocate our costs by each indication for which we are developing nalbuphine ER, as a significant amount of our development activities broadly support all indications. In addition, several of our departments support our nalbuphine ER drug candidate development program and we do not identify internal costs for each potential indication.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next few years as we pursue our development program, pursue regulatory approval of nalbuphine ER in the United States and Europe and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER. Predicting the timing or the cost to conduct our nalbuphine ER development program and prepare for a possible commercial launch of nalbuphine ER is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors including factors outside of our control such as the sample size re-estimation for our PRISM trial. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on our development program. Furthermore, we are unable to predict when or if nalbuphine ER will receive regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere with any certainty.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and other administrative functions, professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services as well as rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services associated with maintaining compliance with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Expense on our Term Loan Facility\nIn December 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital, Ltd. and Square 1 Bank under which we borrowed $15.0 million under a term loan, or the Term Loan. The Term Loan accrued interest at a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 7.75% per annum. The Term Loan required interest-only payments until March 2016, which was extended to November 2016. After November 2016, payments on the Term Loan were made monthly in 20 equal installments of principal plus interest. In June 2018, we paid all amounts owed under the Term Loan.\nChange in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\nThe stock purchase agreement under which we sold shares of Series C preferred stock provided for the issuance and sale of our Series C preferred stock in three separate tranches. The tranches represented a free-standing financial instrument under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 480 and required fair value accounting until they were settled. We recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet for the obligations under this financial instrument. We adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized the changes in fair value in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We continued to recognize changes in the fair value of this liability through the closing of the third tranche, which occurred on January 18, 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Obligation for Loan Success Fee\nIn connection with the Term Loan, we entered into the Success Fee Agreement under which we agreed to pay the lenders a Success Fee upon the occurrence of an exit event, as defined in the Success Fee Agreement. We classified this contingent obligation for the Success Fee as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and we adjusted this liability to fair value at each reporting date. We recognized changes in the fair value of this obligation for the Success Fee in our statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net. We recognized changes in the fair value of the obligation for the Success Fee until the Success Fee payment was triggered and paid upon the closing of our IPO in May 2019.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned from money market funds on our cash and cash equivalents.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table

31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $4.8 million increase in clinical development expenses primarily related to increased activities in several clinical trials including our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, our Phase 2 trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF and our Phase 1b trial in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition, personnel and related expenses increased by $0.3 million as a result of an increase in our employee headcount, and consulting expenses and professional fees increased by $0.3 million as a result of our increased clinical trial activity. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, all of our research and development expenses relate to our development activity for nalbuphine ER.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 68.5%, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and stock-based compensation expenses of $1.4 million, which we incurred from the issuance of new stock option grants upon the IPO and from expanded operations, an increase in expenses related to being a public company of $1.1 million and an increase in consulting expenses and professional fees of $0.5 million.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to other income, net of $0.6 million from other (expense), net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase primarily reflects the change in fair value of our liability during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the shares of Series C preferred stock purchasable in the second and third tranches of our Series C preferred stock financing as well as increased interest income of $0.8 million due to our larger cash balance following our IPO in May 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Prior to the completion of our IPO and concurrent private placement in May 2019, we financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and convertible notes as well as borrowings under the Term Loan. From inception to our IPO, we raised an aggregate of $102.2 million in gross proceeds from sales of our preferred stock and convertible notes and borrowed $15.0 million under the Term Loan. As of June 30, 2018, all amounts owed under the Term Loan had been paid in full.\nIn May 2019, we issued and sold 5,500,000 shares of common stock in our IPO and 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement, in each case at an offering price of $10.00 per share, for combined net proceeds of $62.1 million after deducting aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions and private placement agent fees of $4.9 million and other offering expenses of $3.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.3 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in money market accounts.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented below (in thousands):\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,289\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,818\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $23.1 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $26.1 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million and non-cash charges of $1.4 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $1.4 million increase in accrued expenses, a $0.8 million increase in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase in receivables, and a $0.2 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in accruals related to our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in prurigo nodularis and our Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in IPF. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of vendor invoices. The increase in receivables was primarily due to prepayments made to one of our vendors, which we expect will be paid back to us in the first half of 2020. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to prepayments of our insurance policies. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million and changes in fair value of the Success Fee of $0.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, operating activities used $18.3 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $20.5 million and net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.6 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.8 million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $1.3 million increase in prepaid expenses. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to increases in prepayments under our ongoing research, development and clinical trial work performed by CROs. The non-cash charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of a $2.1 million expense related to the change in fair value of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used an insignificant amount of cash in investing activities, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $73.2 million, primarily consisting of cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and placement agent fees, of $65.1 million from our IPO and concurrent private placement, and $10.0 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the third tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in January 2019, partially offset by costs relating to our IPO of $1.2 million and payment of the $0.7 million Success Fee.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.6 million, primarily consisting of net cash proceeds of $10.5 million from our sales of shares of Series C preferred stock in the second tranche of our Series C preferred stock financing in August 2018, partially offset by payments of $4.8 million on the Term Loan and $0.5 million of final fees on the Term Loan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance nalbuphine ER through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur substantial expenses relating to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, the additional Phase 3 clinical trial we will need to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic cough in patients with IPF, the costs of commercialization activities, including manufacturing capabilities, for nalbuphine ER and other development activities including potentially commencing Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease and for pruritus associated with PBC. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of nalbuphine ER, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, including the results of the sample size re-estimation for our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial that we expect will take place in mid-2020 as well as the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of nalbuphine ER for other serious neurologically mediated conditions, including our ongoing Phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with IPF, as well as any future product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of indications for which we seek to develop nalbuphine ER or any future product candidates, and their respective development requirements; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and costs of clinical and nonclinical trials and of seeking regulatory approvals, including the costs of supportive clinical studies such as our planned human abuse liability study and our planned Thorough QT studies; \n \u2022 the costs associated with the manufacture of necessary quantities of nalbuphine ER or any future product candidate for clinical development in connection with regulatory submissions; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or for any future product candidates that receive marketing approval, if any, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 subject to receipt of marketing approvals, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any other serious neurologically mediated conditions or from any future product candidates; \n \u2022 our ability to identify potential collaborators for nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or for any future product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates; \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license rights to other potential product candidates or technologies, and the terms and timing of any such acquisition or licensing arrangements; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development activities and establish a commercial infrastructure; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products; and \n \u2022 the costs of operating as a public company. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021.\nWe have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to complete the clinical development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or any other indication. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include grants of security interests on our assets and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, granting liens over our assets, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient capital as and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or abandon our product development programs or commercialization efforts. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our financial statements, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nWe have entered into agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies. Our research and development accruals are estimated based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs. The estimated costs of research and development provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and other companies under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the recognition of compensation expense, using a fair value based method, for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options. Our determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options with time-based vesting, and is impacted by our common stock price as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected term that options will remain outstanding, expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe have awarded stock options to non-employees for consultancy services. We have adopted new guidance, effective as of January 1, 2018, which requires that non-employee share-based payment transactions be measured at the grant-date fair value and no longer remeasured at the then-current fair values at each reporting date until the stock options have vested.\nThe fair value of an option award is recognized over the period during which the optionee is required to provide services in exchange for the option award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis.\nEstimating the fair value of equity-settled awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require analysis and judgment to develop.\nExpected Term-The expected term assumption represents the weighted average period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the simplified method\u201d for estimating the expected term of the options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.\nExpected Volatility-For all stock options granted to date, the volatility data was estimated based on a study of publicly traded industry peer companies. For purposes of identifying these peer companies, we considered the industry, stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies.\nExpected Dividend-The Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. We currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the equity-settled award.\nThe following assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of awards granted during the periods indicated:\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected life of options (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms and interest rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.\nStock-based compensation expense, is reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized stock-based compensation was $3.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years.\nThe intrinsic value of all outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.9 million based on a common stock fair value of $3.75 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on December 31, 2019.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO in May 2019, the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined at each grant date by our board of directors, with input from management. All options to purchase shares of our common stock were intended to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, on each grant date, we developed an estimate of the fair value of our common stock based on the information known to us on the date of grant, upon a review of any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock, and in part on input from an independent third-party valuation. As is provided for in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we generally relied on our valuations for up to twelve months unless we had experienced a material event that would have affected the estimated fair value of our common stock.\nOur valuations of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019 were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. The methodology to determine the fair value of our common stock included estimating the fair value of the enterprise using a market approach, which estimates the fair value of the company by including an estimation of the value of the business based on guideline public companies under a number of different scenarios. The assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock were based on numerous objective and subjective factors, combined with management judgment, including external market conditions affecting the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and trends within the industry; our stage of development; the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock; our financial condition and operating results, including our levels of available capital resources; the progress of our research and development efforts, our stage of development and business strategy; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; general U.S. market conditions; and the lack of marketability of our common stock.\nThe Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, we considered the following methods:\n \u2022 Option Pricing Method, or OPM-The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preferences at the time of a liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In the model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the convertible preferred stock liquidation preference is paid. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. This model defines the securities' fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event and the estimated volatility of the equity securities. \n \u2022 Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM-Under the PWERM methodology, the fair value of common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. \n \u2022 Hybrid Method-The hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one of the scenarios is calculated using an OPM. In the hybrid method used by us, we considered an IPO, as the other potential future liquidity event. The equity value for the IPO scenario was determined using the guideline public company, or GPC, method under the market approach. The relative probability of the IPO scenario was determined based on an analysis of market conditions at the time and our expectations as to the timing and likely prospects of the IPO at each valuation date. In our application of the GPC method, we considered publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that had a similar profile to ours as well as recently completed IPOs as indicators of our estimated future value in an IPO. We then discounted that future value back to the valuation date at an appropriate discount rate. \nBased on our early stage of development and other relevant factors, our board of directors determined that the OPM was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for the valuation performed for December 2017, which resulted in our board of directors determining that the fair value of our common stock was $3.33. Following its determination in early 2018 that we should explore a potential IPO, our board of directors determined that the Hybrid Method was the most appropriate method for allocating our enterprise value to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock for valuations performed for April 2018, September 2018 and December 2018, which resulted in the fair value of our common stock being $6.65, $9.12 and $9.31, respectively.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock prior to our IPO in May 2019, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, our board of directors applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the weighted-average expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of our common stock has been determined based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced, as necessary, by a valuation allowance when management determines it is more likely than not that some or all of the tax benefits will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or ASC 740. We assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position's sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we will determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total deferred tax assets were $33.3 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards; which totaled approximately $106.8 million at December 31, 2019. Due to our Series A preferred stock financing in December 2012 and the shares we issued in connection with our IPO in May 2019, we were subject to an ownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Code. As a result, our ability to use $91.3 million of these NOL carryforwards is limited. We may experience further ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If a further ownership change occurred, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards might be further limited.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur financial instruments have consisted of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, term loan payable, Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability and obligation for loan success fee. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short term nature of those instruments. The fair value of the obligation for loan success fee has been estimated utilizing a probability-weighted income approach, including variables for the timing of the success event and other probability estimates. The fair value of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock liability has been estimated as the excess, if any, of the fair value of our Series C preferred stock over the purchase price of any outstanding tranches that may be sold pursuant to our stock purchase agreement referred to in -Components of Operating Results-Other Income (Expense), Net-Change in Fair Value of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Liability\u201d.\nCurrent accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The valuation techniques included in the guidance are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions and are classified into the following fair value hierarchy:\n \u2022 Level 1-Observable inputs-quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 2-Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities-such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. \n \u2022 Level 3-Unobservable inputs-includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the company to develop relevant assumptions. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion regarding our commitments and contingent commitments.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act, permits emerging growth companies such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-02 titled Leases, or ASU 2016-02, which requires rights and obligations arising from both operating and capital leases to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and to disclose quantitative and qualitative information about lease transactions (such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases). ASU 2016-02 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\nWe adopted this new guidance as of January 1, 2019, which included an assessment of the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. We utilized the transition practical expedient added by the FASB, which eliminated the requirement that entities apply the new lease standard to the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. We elected to use the package of practical expedients that allowed us to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts were or contained leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. We used the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of leases as a single lease component. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset of $379 and related lease liabilities of $424 related to our operating lease commitments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019 (Note 4). The impact of adoption of the new leasing standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The list of changes is comprehensive and many will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial reporting. The changes include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, ASU 2019-12 requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method, requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination, and removes the requirement to allocate the current and deferred tax provision among entities in stand-alone financial statement reporting. ASU 2019-12 also now requires that an entity reflect enacted changes in tax laws in the annual effective rate, and other codification adjustments have been made to employee stock ownership plans. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of ASU 2019-12 is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2019-12 in the first interim period of the year ending December 31, 2020.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the way credit losses on certain financial instruments are estimated. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements."}
