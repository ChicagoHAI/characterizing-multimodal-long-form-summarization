MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (this \u201c2020 Form 10-K\u201d). The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2020 Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors, in each case contained in this 2020 Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cDLPN\u201d.\nOn August 17, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social Public Relations, LLC, a California LLC referred to as Be Social. Be Social is a Los Angeles based digital communications group representing both brands and highly-engaged digital influencers. As consideration for the acquisition of the membership interest of Be Social we agreed to pay to the seller, Ms. Alison Grant, (i) $1.5 million in cash and 69,907 shares of our common stock on August 17, 2020 and (ii) issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $350,000 on January 4, 2021. We may also pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Ms. Grant has entered into an employment agreement with a term through December 31, 2023.\nThrough our subsidiaries 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in PR services for the respective industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides digital communication capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin's legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O'Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.\nWe have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2021, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2021 or at all.\nWe operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment comprises 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic marketing consulting, digital marketing capabilities, creative branding and in-house production of content for marketing. The content production segment comprises Dolphin Films and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.\nOn March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected our business and demand for certain of our services. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector that has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients have been negatively impacted by the suspension or reduction of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. We have taken steps to align our expenses with our changes in revenue. The steps being taken across the Company include freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending. We continue to believe that our strategic strengths discussed above will continue to assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.\nEffective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split. Shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the following management discussion and analysis.\nGoing Concern\nManagement has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our accumulated deficit, recurring losses and working capital deficit, as of December 31, 2020. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In addition, we operate in industries that have been adversely affected by COVID-19 (e.g. food, hospitality and talent PR). On June 5, 2020, we sold 1.6 million shares and received proceeds in the amount of approximately $7.6 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, as well as available bank and non-bank financing, or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital or securing loans. Any such issuances of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. In April of 2020, we received five separate loans for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169, prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Payroll Protection Program. There is no assurance that our loans will be forgiven. If we are unable to raise additional funds from the sale of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, bank and non-bank financing or any combination of such financing securities, we may not be able to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nREVENUES\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived substantially all of our revenues from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment derives its revenues from providing public relations services for celebrities and musicians, entertainment and targeted content marketing for film and television series, strategic communications services for corporations and public relations, marketing services and brand strategies for hotels and restaurants. We additionally derived revenues from the content production segment primarily from the distribution of our feature films, Max Steel and Believe. The table below sets forth the percentage of total revenue derived from our two segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entertainment publicity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment Publicity and Marketing\nOur revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. We believe that we have a stable client base, and we have continued to grow organically through referrals and actively soliciting new business, as well as through acquisition of new businesses within the same industry. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.\nWe earn entertainment publicity and marketing revenues primarily through the following:\n\u00b7\nTalent - We earn fees from creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including Oscar, Tony and Emmy winning film, theater and television stars, directors, producers, celebrity chefs and Grammy winning recording artists. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio and/or network liaison work, and event and tour support.\n\u00b7\nEntertainment Marketing and Brand Strategy- We earn fees from providing marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for entertainment content (including theatrical films, television programs, DVD and VOD releases, and online series) from all the major studios, as well as content producers ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. In addition, we provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, food and wine festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red-carpet management. As part of our services, we offer marketing and publicity services tailored to reach diverse audiences. We also provide marketing direction targeted to the ideal consumer through a creative public relations and creative brand strategy for hotel and restaurant groups. Our clients for this type of service include major studios, streaming services, independent producers and leading hotel and restaurant groups. We expect that increased digital streaming marketing budgets at several large key clients will drive growth of revenue and profit in 42West's Entertainment Marketing division over the next several years.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Communications - We earn fees by advising companies looking to create, raise or reposition their public profiles, primarily in the entertainment industry. We believe that growth in Strategic Communications division will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients who are expanding their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products PR sectors. We expect that this growth trend will continue for the next three to five years. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies, as well as high-profile individuals address sensitive situations.\n\u00b7\nCreative Branding and Production - We offer clients creative branding and production services from concept creation to final delivery. Our services include brand strategy, concept and creative development, design and art direction, script and copyrighting, live action production and photography, digital development, video editing and composite, animation, audio mixing and engineering, project management and technical support. We expect that our ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries, will be accretive to our revenue.\n\u00b7\nDigital Media Influencer Marketing Campaigns - We arrange strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers, for both organic and paid campaigns. We also offer services for social media activations at events, as well as editorial work on behalf of brand clients. Our services extend beyond our own captive influencer network, and we manage custom campaigns targeting specific demographics and locations, from ideation to delivery of results reports. We expect that our relationship with social media influencers will provide us the ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries and will be accretive to our revenue.\nContent Production\nProject Development and Related Services\nWe have a team that dedicates a portion of its time to identifying scripts, story treatments and novels for acquisition, development and production. The scripts can be for either digital or motion picture productions. We have acquired the rights to certain scripts that we intend to produce and release in the future, subject to obtaining financing. We have not yet determined if these projects would be produced for digital, television or theatrical distribution.\nOur pipeline of feature films includes:\n\u00b7\nYoungblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic and;\n\u00b7\nSisters Before Misters, a comedy about two estranged sisters finding their way back to each other after a misunderstanding causes one of them to have to plan the other's wedding.\n\u00b7\nOut of their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband versus wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and\nWe have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production once financing is obtained. We are planning to fund these projects through third-party financing arrangements, domestic distribution advances, pre-sales, and location-based tax credits, and if necessary, sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to produce any of these feature films.\nEXPENSES\nOur expenses consist primarily of: (1) direct costs; (2) selling, general and administrative expenses; (3) depreciation and amortization expense; (4) legal and professional fees and (5) payroll expenses.\nDirect costs include certain cost of services, as well as certain production costs, related to our entertainment publicity and marketing business. Included within direct costs are immaterial impairments for any of our content production projects.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all overhead costs except for payroll, depreciation and amortization and legal and professional fees that are reported as a separate expense item.\nDepreciation and amortization include the depreciation of our property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and leasehold improvements.\nLegal and professional fees include fees paid to our attorneys, fees for investor relations consultants, audit and accounting fees and fees for general business consultants.\nPayroll expenses include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits.\nOther Income and Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other income and expenses consisted primarily of: (1) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (2) acquisition costs; (3) changes in the fair value of put rights; (4) changes in fair value of contingent consideration; (5) changes in fair value of warrants; (6) changes in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities and (7) interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also had a loss on the deconsolidation of our Max Steel variable interest entity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were as follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entertainment publicity and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,946,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,915,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,054,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,001,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues from entertainment publicity and marketing decreased by approximately $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease a result of COVID-19 and its effects on food and hospitality sector and the talent division. Government imposed orders to either reduce or completely shut down the in-restaurant service has caused our clients to either reduce or suspend the services we offer. As the production of content was halted between mid-March 2020 and July 2020, several of our talent clients requested to suspend their services during this period until the recommencement of production.\nRevenues from content production increased by $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Revenues for the content production segment are currently derived from either Max Steel or Believe, feature films that were released in 2016 and 2013, respectively, and our nearing the end of their normal revenue cycles.\nOn August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender of the prints and advertising loan and agreed to give them up $0.9 million of future domestic distribution revenue in exchange for the payment and full satisfaction of the prints and advertising loan in the amount of $0.7 million, including accrued interest, on the date of the agreement. We do not expect to receive any significant future revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel.\nExpenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating expenses were as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,576,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,043,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,822,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,799,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,030,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,946,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and professional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,191,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,560,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,990,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,735,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,610,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,087,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is related to the changes described below.\nDirect costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct costs for Viewpoint are primarily costs attributable to the production costs of each of their projects. The decrease in direct costs is primarily related to a decrease in Viewpoint's revenue due to COVID-19, as well as reduced direct client costs at 42West and The Door from a slowdown in business from COVID-19.\nDirect costs attributable to the content production segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.05 million, mainly attributable to the impairment of script costs. Direct costs related to the content production segment were approximately $0.8 million for 2019. During 2019, direct costs for the content production segment consisted primarily of impairment of capitalized production for Max Steel as a result of the agreement to direct all future domestic film revenues up to $0.9 million to the print and advertising loan's creditor, in settlement of said loan. We evaluate capitalized production costs to determine if the fair value of the capitalized production costs is below the carrying value. Based on management's estimate of ultimate revenues for Max Steel, the capitalized production costs in the amount of $0.6 million were determined to be above fair value and were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses for Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and four months of selling, general and administrative expenses for Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization had an immaterial increase of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to the amortization of intangible assets of Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nLegal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in audit fees and certain legal fees.\nPayroll expenses decreased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In response to the business slowdown due to COVID-19, the certain staff salaries were reduced during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of Shore Fire and Be Social payroll expense.\nOther Income and Expenses\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,311,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on deconsolidation of Max Steel VIE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,484,591\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,042\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of put rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,745,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,880,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(534,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and debt amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,133,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,545,206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,339,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million primarily related to the Max Steel VIE. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the production service agreement confirmed that the Max Steel VIE did not owe them any debt. We reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE. As a result, we deconsolidated the Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of approximately $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14-(Variable Interest Entities) to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our analysis of primary beneficiary status.\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed to exchange up to $0.9 million of future domestic revenues of Max Steel for the extinguishment of the prints and advertising loan and recorded $0.7 million of a gain on the extinguishment of that debt.\nAcquisition costs consisted primarily of legal, consulting and auditing costs related to our acquisitions. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of Be Social in August 2020. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of costs associated with our acquisition of Shore Fire in December 2019.\nThe fair value of put rights related to the 42West acquisition were recorded on our balance sheet on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the put rights is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the puts was $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of The Door and Be Social were recorded on our balance sheet on July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent consideration is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss of $0.06 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a gain of approximately $0.2 million and was related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for The Door.\nWe elected the fair value option for certain convertible notes issued in 2020. The embedded conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note meets the criteria for a derivative. The fair value of these notes and embedded conversion feature are remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature of $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net income.\nWarrants issued with each of the 2019 and 2020 Lincoln Park convertible notes payable and Series \u201cI\u201d warrant were each initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of these warrants increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense and debt amortization decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to convertible promissory notes that were converted into shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion on these notes payable.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe had an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary component of the income tax benefit in both years is due to a release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities of the companies acquired.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $46.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, we have approximately $26.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14.9 million of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3.9 million, approximately $4.3 million of New York state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038, approximately $3.9 million of New York city net operating loss carryforwards that being to expire in 2038, approximately $0.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031, and approximately $1.3 million of Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nIn assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we have accordingly recorded a net valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was approximately $(1.9) million or $(0.35) per share based on 5,619,969 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(0.58) per share based on 6,382,937 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net loss was approximately $(2.3) million or $(0.70) per share based on 3,304,585 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(1.20) per share based on 4,285,101 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the factors discussed above.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.5 million. Our net loss of approximately $1.9 million contained non-cash items such as gain on extinguishment of debt and changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $1.3 million resulting in $0.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, primarily from the increase of accounts receivable for projects completed by The Door and Viewpoint at year end. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.9 million. Our net loss of approximately $2.3 million contained non-cash items such as changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $0.3 million resulting in $2.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $0.3 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million primarily related to (i) a payment of deferred cash consideration for the Shore Fire acquisition in the amount of $0.3 million, (ii) a payment of approximately $1.0 million, net of cash acquired for the Be Social acquisition and $0.08 for fixed assets purchased. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $0.9 million and were primarily related to approximately $0.8 million for the purchase of Shore Fire, net of cash acquired and approximately $0.1 million for the purchase of fixed assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $8.6 million as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of the net of (i) $0.5 million to paydown the line of credit with Bank United; (ii) $0.3 million of principal and interest payments for the term loan with Bank United; (iii) $1.6 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iv) $0.3 million comprising the final installment of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (v) $1.9 million to repay convertible notes that matured, including $0.7 million to a related party, Leslee Dart, a member of the Board of Directors; (vi) $0.8 million consideration paid in installments as deferred cash consideration to the seller of Shore Fire; (vii) $7.6 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a registered direct offering in June of 2020 and (viii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3.6 million. By contrast, cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.4 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of (i) $0.1 million of net repayment of debt related to Max Steel; (ii) $2.3 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iii) $0.3 million comprising the second and third installments of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (iv) second installment of the consideration for The Door in the amount of $0.8 million; (v) final installment of the consideration paid to employees of 42West to settle change of control provisions in their employment contracts in the amount of $0.4 million; (vi) $1.9 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a public offering in October 2019; (vii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $2.1 million and (viii) proceeds from non-convertible note payable of $0.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash available for working capital of approximately $7.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, not including $0.7 million pledged as collateral for standby letter of credit for the New York office, and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.\nOur net losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, along with an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.0 million as of December 31, 2020, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2020 Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Such issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. We currently have the rights to several scripts, that we intend to produce and release subject to obtaining financing. We will potentially earn a producer and overhead fee for this production. There can be no assurances that such production will be released or fees will be realized in future periods.\nOur subsidiaries operate in industries that were adversely affected by the government mandated shelter-in-place, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we entered into five separate loan agreements and received an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no assurance that our obligation under these loans will be forgiven.\nIn addition, we have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $10.9 million and our total stockholders' equity was approximately $19.7 million. Approximately $1.5 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 represents the fair value of put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 is related to PPP Loans received that may be forgiven upon application to the lender for qualifying expenditures primarily related to payroll costs.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nFinancing Arrangements\nPrints and Advertising Loan\nOn August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, or Max Steel Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the P&A Loan, providing for a $14.5 million non-revolving credit facility that matured on August 25, 2017. The loan was not guaranteed by any other Dolphin entity and the only asset held by Max Steel Holdings is the copyright for the motion picture. The loan was also secured by $1,250,000 in a deposit account and a third-party guarantee of $4,500,000, of which Dolphin agreed to backstop $620,000. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay a portion of the P&A expenses of the domestic distribution of our feature film, Max Steel. During 2017 the lender applied the $1,250,000 in the deposit account and the third-party guarantor paid the $4,500,000 to reduce the loan balance. Repayment of the loan was intended to be made from revenues generated by Max Steel in the United States. Max Steel did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan prior to the maturity date. On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender whereby they are entitled to the next $0.9 million of revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel in exchange for payment and satisfaction in full of the P&A Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million related to this revenue participation agreement.\nProduction Service Agreement\nDuring 2014, the Max Steel variable interest entity (or Max Steel VIE), created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel, entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $10.4 million to produce Max Steel. The loan was partially secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The agreement contained repayment milestones to be made during 2015, which were not met and, as such, accrued interest at a default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited until the maturity date of January 31, 2016 or the release of the movie. Due to delays in the release of the film, Max Steel VIE was unable to make some of the scheduled payments and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Max Steel VIE accrued $1.6 million of interest at the default rate. The film was released in theaters in the United States on October 14, 2016 and delivery to the international distributors began after the US release. On February 20, 2020, the Company received notification from the lender of the Production Service Agreement that the Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt to the lender. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3.3 million during year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a balance of $0 and $3.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets related to the Production Service Agreement.\n42West Line of Credit\nOn March 15, 2018, 42West entered into a business loan agreement with BankUnited, N.A., (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), for a revolving line of credit agreement under a revolving note. The revolving line of credit matured on March 15, 2020 and bore interest on the outstanding balance at the bank's prime rate plus 0.25% per annum. The maximum amount that could be drawn on the revolving line of credit was $2,300,000. Amounts outstanding under the note were secured by 42West's current and future inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles. On March 28, 2018, we drew $1,690,000 from the line of credit facility to purchase 36,659 shares of our common stock, per the put agreements with the sellers of 42West. On February 20, 2020, in anticipation of converting the line of credit into a term loan, we partially repaid the line of credit in the amount of $500,000. On March 31, 2020 we converted the line of credit into a three-year term loan in the amount of $1,200,390. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the loan recorded on our balance sheet was $1,700,390.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender's Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the balance on the term loan was $900,292.\nThe Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door's insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our calculations, we believe we are out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we have classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nPromissory Notes\nNonconvertible Notes\nOn November 5, 2019, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $350,000 that matures two years after issuance. We may prepay this promissory note with no penalty after the initial six months. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nOn December 10, 2018, we agreed to exchange an unsecured promissory note with a principal balance of $300,000 that had been issued in 2012 and accrued interest of $192,233, for a new unsecured promissory note in the amount of $492,233 that matures on December 10, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and provides for monthly repayments of principal and interest in the amount of $10,459 beginning January 15, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid interest of $122,732, recorded interest expense of $0.7 million, including debt amortization, on our consolidated statement of operations related to the beneficial conversion of the 2019 convertible notes.\n2018 Convertible Debt\nOn July 5, 2018, we issued an 8% secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.5 million, to Pinnacle Family Office Investments, L.P. (\u201cPinnacle\u201d), pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated the same date, herein referred to as the Pinnacle Note. We used the proceeds of the Pinnacle Note to finance the Company's acquisition of The Door. Our obligations under the Pinnacle Note were secured primarily by a lien on the assets of The Door and Viewpoint. The Pinnacle Note matured on January 5, 2020. The Pinnacle Note contained a clause that re-prices the conversion price if we sell equity securities at a price lower than the conversion price at any time that the Pinnacle Note is outstanding. On October 21, 2019, we issued 540,000 shares of common stock pursuant to a public offering at a purchase price of $3.90 per share. As such, the conversion price of the Pinnacle Note was adjusted to $3.91. On December 4, 2019, Pinnacle converted $297,936 of the Pinnacle Note into 76,121 shares of our common stock.\nOn January 5, 2020, the Pinnacle Note maturity date, we paid Pinnacle $1,231,678, including accrued interest of $29,614, in full satisfaction and repayment of the Pinnacle Note. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded debt amortization for a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of $0.07 million, related to the Pinnacle Note.\n2017 Convertible Debt\nIn 2017, we entered into subscription agreements pursuant to which we issued unsecured convertible promissory notes, each with substantially similar terms, for an aggregate principal amount of $625,000. The convertible promissory notes matured during the third quarter of 2020 and each bore interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The principal and any accrued and unpaid interest of the convertible promissory notes were convertible by the respective noteholders into shares of our common stock at a price of either (i) the 90-day average closing market price per share of our common stock as of the date the holder submits a notice of conversion or (ii) if an Eligible Offering (as defined in the convertible promissory notes) of our common stock is made, 95% of the public offering price per share of our common stock. On June 15, 2020, $250,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt and $2,905 of accrued interest was converted into 84,302 shares of our common stock; on June 17, 2020, $75,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt and $333 of accrued interest was converted into 24,802 shares of our common stock; on June 30, 2020, $50,000 of the 2017 Convertible Debt was converted into 15,873 shares of our common stock and on July 1, 2020, two notes in the aggregate amount of $100,000 were converted into 32,002 shares of our common stock, using a 90-day average trading price. We recorded as debt amortization a beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Debt in the aggregate amount of $550,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have an outstanding balance for any of the 2017 convertible debt. During 2020, we paid interest in the amount of $29,154, recorded interest expense in the amount of $24,917 and recorded as debt amortization a beneficial conversion feature related to the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Debt in the aggregate amount of $550,000 on our consolidated statement of operations.\n2020 Registered Direct Offering\nOn June 5, 2020, we issued and sold to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.25 per share. The offering of the shares was made pursuant to our then effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received proceeds of approximately $7.6 million from the issuance and sale of our common stock after deducting related offering fees and expenses.\n2019 Public Offering\nOn October 21, 2019, in an underwritten registered public offering, we sold 540,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.91 per share. The net proceeds of the 2019 Public Offering were approximately $1.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or \u201cGAAP\u201d. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAdditionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we have made appropriate accounting estimates on certain accounting matters, which include the allowance for doubtful accounts, carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets, based on the facts and circumstances available to us as of the reporting date. Our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our financial statements in future reporting periods.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2020, in connection with its acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social, we have a balance of $19,627,856 of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which management has assigned to the entertainment publicity and marketing segment. This amount includes a provisional goodwill balance of $1,555,030 related to the Be Social acquisition and a working capital adjustment in the amount of $124,836 pursuant to the Shore Fire purchase agreement that were each made during the year ended December 31, 2020. We account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d). ASC 350 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We evaluate goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its' carrying amount, we conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying value (including goodwill). We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its' carrying value, a goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recorded.\nWe determined that the adverse effects of COVID-19 on certain of the industries in which we operate could be an indicator of a possible impairment of goodwill. As such, we updated our estimates and assumptions, with the information available as of the date of the assessment, performed an impairment test on the carrying value of our goodwill and determined that an impairment adjustment was not necessary. As previously discussed, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. Our future assessment of the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business could result in impairment of goodwill in future reporting periods.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires all assets and liabilities arising from leases to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB added an optional transition method which we elected upon adoption of the new standard. This allowed us to recognize and measure leases existing at January 1, 2019 without restating comparative information. In addition, we elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical lease classification.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at the lease commencement date. In addition to our lease agreements, we review all material new vendor arrangements for potential embedded lease obligations. The asset balance related to operating leases is presented within \u201cright-of-use (ROU) asset\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. The current and noncurrent balances related to operating leases are presented as \u201cLease liability\u201d, in their respective classifications, on our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for the leases in existence on the date of adoption or our incremental borrowing rate on the date of the lease for leases entered into after January 1, 2019. The ROU asset is calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date (i.e. prepaid rent) and initial direct costs incurred by us and excluding any lease incentives received from the Lessor. For operating leases, the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for its lease and non-lease components as a single component, and therefore both are included in the calculation of lease liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Applying this guidance, we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.\nRevenue from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment consists of fees from the performance of professional services and billings for direct costs reimbursed by clients. Fees are generally recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis, as the services are consumed by our clients, which approximates the proportional performance on such contracts. Direct costs reimbursed by clients are billed as pass-through revenue with no mark-up. We enter into contracts that provide for third-party costs. We typically act as an agent in these types of arrangements and recognize the revenue only on the fees attributable to our performance of the contract and not including the third-party costs which are not recorded on our consolidated statement of operations. Revenues from content produced for digital marketing is recognized upon satisfactory delivery to the client. We also enter into management agreements with a roster of social media influencers and are paid a percentage of the revenue earned by the social media influencer. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, the performance obligation is typically completed and revenue is recognized in the period in which the contract originated.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of our company. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, defined as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Level 1\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Level 2\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Level 3\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as of the reporting date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe carry certain derivative financial instruments using inputs classified as \u201cLevel 3\u201d in the fair value hierarchy on our balance sheets.\nConvertible Notes and Warrants\nThe 2019 Lincoln Park Warrants, the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants and the Series \u201cI\u201d Warrant were each determined to be a derivative liability under FASB ASC 815. Each are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet. They were each initially measured at fair value at time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as other income or expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes simulation valuation model. The model utilized our common stock price and certain Level 3 inputs to take into account the probabilities of certain events occurring over their respective life.\nWe account for the issued and outstanding 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes under the \u201cFair Value Option election\u201d of ASC 825, Financial Instruments, as discussed below. The notes are each a debt financial instrument host containing embedded features and /or options which would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815. Notwithstanding, ASC 825-10-15-4 provides for the \u201cfair value option\u201d (\u201cFVO\u201d), to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825-10-15-5, to be afforded to financial instruments, wherein the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. Further, the estimated fair value adjustment, as required by ASC 825-10-45-5, is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) with respect to the portion of the fair value adjustment attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, with the remaining amount of the fair value adjustment recognized as other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. With respect to our 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes, the \u201cother income (expense) component\u201d is presented in a single line in the consolidated statement of operations within net income, as none of the change in fair value was attributable to instrument specific credit risk. See our accompanying consolidated financial statements Note 11 - Notes Payable, and Note 13- Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of such FVO election and the 2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes.\nThe recurring and non-recurring estimated fair value measurements are subjective and are affected by changes in inputs to the valuation models, including our common stock price, and certain Level 3 inputs, including, the assumptions regarding the estimated volatility in the value of our common stock price; our dividend yield; the likelihood and timing of future dilutive transactions, as applicable, along with the risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury security yields. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair values.\nPut Rights\nIn connection with the 42West acquisition, we entered into put agreements with each of the sellers of 42West granting them the right, but not the obligation, to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 237,419 of their shares received as consideration for their membership interest of 42West, including the put rights on the shares earned from the earn out consideration. Based upon the results of operations of 42West during 2017, the sellers earned the additional consideration. In January of 2018, we also entered into put agreements with certain 42West employees granting them the right, but not the obligation, to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 28,140 of their shares received in April 2017 and in July 2018 and those earned from the earn out consideration. We have agreed to purchase the shares at $46.10 per share during certain specified exercise periods as set forth in the put agreements, up until March 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 41,486 shares of common stock and paid approximately $1.6 million cash for put rights that were exercised, including $275,000 for put rights exercised in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we owed the sellers of 42West $560,900 for put rights that were exercised and not paid.\nWe use a Black-Scholes Option Pricing model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the put rights reflects management's own assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the put rights. The put rights were initially measured on the date of the put agreements and are subsequently measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between balance sheet dates, being recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.\nContingent Consideration\nOn July 5, 2018, as part of the merger agreement with the former members of The Door, we agreed to pay up to 307,692 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $16.25 and up to $2.0 million in cash if certain adjusted net income targets were met over a four-year period. If the adjusted net income targets are achieved, the contingent consideration is first paid in shares of common stock and the last $2.0 million of contingent consideration earned is paid in cash. On August 17, 2020, as part of the purchase agreement with the former member of Be Social, we agreed to pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nTo value the contingent consideration, we used a Monte Carlo Simulation Model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The contingent consideration was initially measured as of the date of the merger (The Door) and acquisition (Be Social) (July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020) and is subsequently measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between balance sheet dates, being recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe reported an effective tax rate of (7.7)% and (25.4)% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $46,494,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and have recorded a net valuation allowance of $19,107,000 and $16,451,955 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in this deferred tax account.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this 2020 Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this 2020 Form 10-K contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act\u201d, which are subject to the \u201csafe harbor\u201d created by those sections.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (this \u201c2020 Form 10-K\u201d). The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2020 Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors, in each case contained in this 2020 Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cDLPN\u201d.\nOn August 17, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social Public Relations, LLC, a California LLC referred to as Be Social. Be Social is a Los Angeles based digital communications group representing both brands and highly-engaged digital influencers. As consideration for the acquisition of the membership interest of Be Social we agreed to pay to the seller, Ms. Alison Grant, (i) $1.5 million in cash and 69,907 shares of our common stock on August 17, 2020 and (ii) issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $350,000 on January 4, 2021. We may also pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Ms. Grant has entered into an employment agreement with a term through December 31, 2023.\nThrough our subsidiaries 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in PR services for the respective industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides digital communication capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin's legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O'Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.\nWe have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2021, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2021 or at all.\nWe operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment comprises 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic marketing consulting, digital marketing capabilities, creative branding and in-house production of content for marketing. The content production segment comprises Dolphin Films and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.\nOn March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected our business and demand for certain of our services. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector that has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients have been negatively impacted by the suspension or reduction of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. We have taken steps to align our expenses with our changes in revenue. The steps being taken across the Company include freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending. We continue to believe that our strategic strengths discussed above will continue to assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.\nEffective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split. Shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the following management discussion and analysis.\nGoing Concern\nManagement has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our accumulated deficit, recurring losses and working capital deficit, as of December 31, 2020. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In addition, we operate in industries that have been adversely affected by COVID-19 (e.g. food, hospitality and talent PR). On June 5, 2020, we sold 1.6 million shares and received proceeds in the amount of approximately $7.6 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, as well as available bank and non-bank financing, or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital or securing loans. Any such issuances of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. In April of 2020, we received five separate loans for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169, prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Payroll Protection Program. There is no assurance that our loans will be forgiven. If we are unable to raise additional funds from the sale of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, bank and non-bank financing or any combination of such financing securities, we may not be able to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nREVENUES\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived substantially all of our revenues from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment derives its revenues from providing public relations services for celebrities and musicians, entertainment and targeted content marketing for film and television series, strategic communications services for corporations and public relations, marketing services and brand strategies for hotels and restaurants. We additionally derived revenues from the content production segment primarily from the distribution of our feature films, Max Steel and Believe. The table below sets forth the percentage of total revenue derived from our two segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nEntertainment Publicity and Marketing\nOur revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. We believe that we have a stable client base, and we have continued to grow organically through referrals and actively soliciting new business, as well as through acquisition of new businesses within the same industry. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.\nWe earn entertainment publicity and marketing revenues primarily through the following:\n\u00b7\nTalent - We earn fees from creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including Oscar, Tony and Emmy winning film, theater and television stars, directors, producers, celebrity chefs and Grammy winning recording artists. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio and/or network liaison work, and event and tour support.\n\u00b7\nEntertainment Marketing and Brand Strategy- We earn fees from providing marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for entertainment content (including theatrical films, television programs, DVD and VOD releases, and online series) from all the major studios, as well as content producers ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. In addition, we provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, food and wine festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red-carpet management. As part of our services, we offer marketing and publicity services tailored to reach diverse audiences. We also provide marketing direction targeted to the ideal consumer through a creative public relations and creative brand strategy for hotel and restaurant groups. Our clients for this type of service include major studios, streaming services, independent producers and leading hotel and restaurant groups. We expect that increased digital streaming marketing budgets at several large key clients will drive growth of revenue and profit in 42West's Entertainment Marketing division over the next several years.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Communications - We earn fees by advising companies looking to create, raise or reposition their public profiles, primarily in the entertainment industry. We believe that growth in Strategic Communications division will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients who are expanding their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products PR sectors. We expect that this growth trend will continue for the next three to five years. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies, as well as high-profile individuals address sensitive situations.\n\u00b7\nCreative Branding and Production - We offer clients creative branding and production services from concept creation to final delivery. Our services include brand strategy, concept and creative development, design and art direction, script and copyrighting, live action production and photography, digital development, video editing and composite, animation, audio mixing and engineering, project management and technical support. We expect that our ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries, will be accretive to our revenue.\n\u00b7\nDigital Media Influencer Marketing Campaigns - We arrange strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers, for both organic and paid campaigns. We also offer services for social media activations at events, as well as editorial work on behalf of brand clients. Our services extend beyond our own captive influencer network, and we manage custom campaigns targeting specific demographics and locations, from ideation to delivery of results reports. We expect that our relationship with social media influencers will provide us the ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries and will be accretive to our revenue.\nContent Production\nProject Development and Related Services\nWe have a team that dedicates a portion of its time to identifying scripts, story treatments and novels for acquisition, development and production. The scripts can be for either digital or motion picture productions. We have acquired the rights to certain scripts that we intend to produce and release in the future, subject to obtaining financing. We have not yet determined if these projects would be produced for digital, television or theatrical distribution.\nOur pipeline of feature films includes:\n\u00b7\nYoungblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic and;\n\u00b7\nSisters Before Misters, a comedy about two estranged sisters finding their way back to each other after a misunderstanding causes one of them to have to plan the other's wedding.\n\u00b7\nOut of their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband versus wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and\nWe have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production once financing is obtained. We are planning to fund these projects through third-party financing arrangements, domestic distribution advances, pre-sales, and location-based tax credits, and if necessary, sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to produce any of these feature films.\nEXPENSES\nOur expenses consist primarily of: (1) direct costs; (2) selling, general and administrative expenses; (3) depreciation and amortization expense; (4) legal and professional fees and (5) payroll expenses.\nDirect costs include certain cost of services, as well as certain production costs, related to our entertainment publicity and marketing business. Included within direct costs are immaterial impairments for any of our content production projects.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all overhead costs except for payroll, depreciation and amortization and legal and professional fees that are reported as a separate expense item.\nDepreciation and amortization include the depreciation of our property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and leasehold improvements.\nLegal and professional fees include fees paid to our attorneys, fees for investor relations consultants, audit and accounting fees and fees for general business consultants.\nPayroll expenses include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits.\nOther Income and Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other income and expenses consisted primarily of: (1) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (2) acquisition costs; (3) changes in the fair value of put rights; (4) changes in fair value of contingent consideration; (5) changes in fair value of warrants; (6) changes in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities and (7) interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also had a loss on the deconsolidation of our Max Steel variable interest entity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were as follows:\n\nRevenues from entertainment publicity and marketing decreased by approximately $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease a result of COVID-19 and its effects on food and hospitality sector and the talent division. Government imposed orders to either reduce or completely shut down the in-restaurant service has caused our clients to either reduce or suspend the services we offer. As the production of content was halted between mid-March 2020 and July 2020, several of our talent clients requested to suspend their services during this period until the recommencement of production.\nRevenues from content production increased by $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Revenues for the content production segment are currently derived from either Max Steel or Believe, feature films that were released in 2016 and 2013, respectively, and our nearing the end of their normal revenue cycles.\nOn August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender of the prints and advertising loan and agreed to give them up $0.9 million of future domestic distribution revenue in exchange for the payment and full satisfaction of the prints and advertising loan in the amount of $0.7 million, including accrued interest, on the date of the agreement. We do not expect to receive any significant future revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel.\nExpenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating expenses were as follows:\n\nOverall expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is related to the changes described below.\nDirect costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct costs for Viewpoint are primarily costs attributable to the production costs of each of their projects. The decrease in direct costs is primarily related to a decrease in Viewpoint's revenue due to COVID-19, as well as reduced direct client costs at 42West and The Door from a slowdown in business from COVID-19.\nDirect costs attributable to the content production segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.05 million, mainly attributable to the impairment of script costs. Direct costs related to the content production segment were approximately $0.8 million for 2019. During 2019, direct costs for the content production segment consisted primarily of impairment of capitalized production for Max Steel as a result of the agreement to direct all future domestic film revenues up to $0.9 million to the print and advertising loan's creditor, in settlement of said loan. We evaluate capitalized production costs to determine if the fair value of the capitalized production costs is below the carrying value. Based on management's estimate of ultimate revenues for Max Steel, the capitalized production costs in the amount of $0.6 million were determined to be above fair value and were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses for Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and four months of selling, general and administrative expenses for Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization had an immaterial increase of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to the amortization of intangible assets of Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nLegal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in audit fees and certain legal fees.\nPayroll expenses decreased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In response to the business slowdown due to COVID-19, the certain staff salaries were reduced during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of Shore Fire and Be Social payroll expense.\nOther Income and Expenses\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million primarily related to the Max Steel VIE. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the production service agreement confirmed that the Max Steel VIE did not owe them any debt. We reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE. As a result, we deconsolidated the Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of approximately $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14-(Variable Interest Entities) to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our analysis of primary beneficiary status.\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed to exchange up to $0.9 million of future domestic revenues of Max Steel for the extinguishment of the prints and advertising loan and recorded $0.7 million of a gain on the extinguishment of that debt.\nAcquisition costs consisted primarily of legal, consulting and auditing costs related to our acquisitions. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of Be Social in August 2020. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of costs associated with our acquisition of Shore Fire in December 2019.\nThe fair value of put rights related to the 42West acquisition were recorded on our balance sheet on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the put rights is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the puts was $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of The Door and Be Social were recorded on our balance sheet on July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent consideration is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss of $0.06 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a gain of approximately $0.2 million and was related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for The Door.\nWe elected the fair value option for certain convertible notes issued in 2020. The embedded conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note meets the criteria for a derivative. The fair value of these notes and embedded conversion feature are remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature of $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net income.\nWarrants issued with each of the 2019 and 2020 Lincoln Park convertible notes payable and Series \u201cI\u201d warrant were each initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of these warrants increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense and debt amortization decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to convertible promissory notes that were converted into shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion on these notes payable.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe had an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary component of the income tax benefit in both years is due to a release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities of the companies acquired.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $46.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, we have approximately $26.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14.9 million of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3.9 million, approximately $4.3 million of New York state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038, approximately $3.9 million of New York city net operating loss carryforwards that being to expire in 2038, approximately $0.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031, and approximately $1.3 million of Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nIn assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we have accordingly recorded a net valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was approximately $(1.9) million or $(0.35) per share based on 5,619,969 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(0.58) per share based on 6,382,937 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net loss was approximately $(2.3) million or $(0.70) per share based on 3,304,585 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(1.20) per share based on 4,285,101 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the factors discussed above.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.5 million. Our net loss of approximately $1.9 million contained non-cash items such as gain on extinguishment of debt and changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $1.3 million resulting in $0.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, primarily from the increase of accounts receivable for projects completed by The Door and Viewpoint at year end. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.9 million. Our net loss of approximately $2.3 million contained non-cash items such as changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $0.3 million resulting in $2.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $0.3 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million primarily related to (i) a payment of deferred cash consideration for the Shore Fire acquisition in the amount of $0.3 million, (ii) a payment of approximately $1.0 million, net of cash acquired for the Be Social acquisition and $0.08 for fixed assets purchased. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $0.9 million and were primarily related to approximately $0.8 million for the purchase of Shore Fire, net of cash acquired and approximately $0.1 million for the purchase of fixed assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $8.6 million as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of the net of (i) $0.5 million to paydown the line of credit with Bank United; (ii) $0.3 million of principal and interest payments for the term loan with Bank United; (iii) $1.6 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iv) $0.3 million comprising the final installment of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (v) $1.9 million to repay convertible notes that matured, including $0.7 million to a related party, Leslee Dart, a member of the Board of Directors; (vi) $0.8 million consideration paid in installments as deferred cash consideration to the seller of Shore Fire; (vii) $7.6 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a registered direct offering in June of 2020 and (viii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3.6 million. By contrast, cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.4 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of (i) $0.1 million of net repayment of debt related to Max Steel; (ii) $2.3 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iii) $0.3 million comprising the second and third installments of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (iv) second installment of the consideration for The Door in the amount of $0.8 million; (v) final installment of the consideration paid to employees of 42West to settle change of control provisions in their employment contracts in the amount of $0.4 million; (vi) $1.9 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a public offering in October 2019; (vii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $2.1 million and (viii) proceeds from non-convertible note payable of $0.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash available for working capital of approximately $7.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, not including $0.7 million pledged as collateral for standby letter of credit for the New York office, and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.\nOur net losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, along with an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.0 million as of December 31, 2020, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2020 Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Such issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. We currently have the rights to several scripts, that we intend to produce and release subject to obtaining financing. We will potentially earn a producer and overhead fee for this production. There can be no assurances that such production will be released or fees will be realized in future periods.\nOur subsidiaries operate in industries that were adversely affected by the government mandated shelter-in-place, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we entered into five separate loan agreements and received an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no assurance that our obligation under these loans will be forgiven.\nIn addition, we have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $10.9 million and our total stockholders' equity was approximately $19.7 million. Approximately $1.5 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 represents the fair value of put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 is related to PPP Loans received that may be forgiven upon application to the lender for qualifying expenditures primarily related to payroll costs.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nFinancing Arrangements\nPrints and Advertising Loan\nOn August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, or Max Steel Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the P&A Loan, providing for a $14.5 million non-revolving credit facility that matured on August 25, 2017. The loan was not guaranteed by any other Dolphin entity and the only asset held by Max Steel Holdings is the copyright for the motion picture. The loan was also secured by $1,250,000 in a deposit account and a third-party guarantee of $4,500,000, of which Dolphin agreed to backstop $620,000. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay a portion of the P&A expenses of the domestic distribution of our feature film, Max Steel. During 2017 the lender applied the $1,250,000 in the deposit account and the third-party guarantor paid the $4,500,000 to reduce the loan balance. Repayment of the loan was intended to be made from revenues generated by Max Steel in the United States. Max Steel did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan prior to the maturity date. On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender whereby they are entitled to the next $0.9 million of revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel in exchange for payment and satisfaction in full of the P&A Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million related to this revenue participation agreement.\nProduction Service Agreement\nDuring 2014, the Max Steel variable interest entity (or Max Steel VIE), created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel, entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $10.4 million to produce Max Steel. The loan was partially secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The agreement contained repayment milestones to be made during 2015, which were not met and, as such, accrued interest at a default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited until the maturity date of January 31, 2016 or the release of the movie. Due to delays in the release of the film, Max Steel VIE was unable to make some of the scheduled payments and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Max Steel VIE accrued $1.6 million of interest at the default rate. The film was released in theaters in the United States on October 14, 2016 and delivery to the international distributors began after the US release. On February 20, 2020, the Company received notification from the lender of the Production Service Agreement that the Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt to the lender. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3.3 million during year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a balance of $0 and $3.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets related to the Production Service Agreement.\n42West Line of Credit\nOn March 15, 2018, 42West entered into a business loan agreement with BankUnited, N.A., (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), for a revolving line of credit agreement under a revolving note. The revolving line of credit matured on March 15, 2020 and bore interest on the outstanding balance at the bank's prime rate plus 0.25% per annum. The maximum amount that could be drawn on the revolving line of credit was $2,300,000. Amounts outstanding under the note were secured by 42West's current and future inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles. On March 28, 2018, we drew $1,690,000 from the line of credit facility to purchase 36,659 shares of our common stock, per the put agreements with the sellers of 42West. On February 20, 2020, in anticipation of converting the line of credit into a term loan, we partially repaid the line of credit in the amount of $500,000. On March 31, 2020 we converted the line of credit into a three-year term loan in the amount of $1,200,390. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the loan recorded on our balance sheet was $1,700,390.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender's Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the balance on the term loan was $900,292.\nThe Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door's insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our calculations, we believe we are out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we have classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nPromissory Notes\nNonconvertible Notes\nOn November 5, 2019, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $350,000 that matures two years after issuance. We may prepay this promissory note with no penalty after the initial six months. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nOn December 10, 2018, we agreed to exchange an unsecured promissory note with a principal balance of $300,000 that had been issued in 2012 and accrued interest of $192,233, for a new unsecured promissory note in the amount of $492,233 that matures on December 10, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and provides for monthly repayments of principal and interest in the amount of $10,459 beginning January 15, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid interest of $122,732, recorded interest expense of $0.7 million, including debt amortization, on our consolidated statement of operations related to the beneficial conversion of the 2019 convertible notes.\n2018 Convertible Debt\nOn July 5, 2018, we issued an 8% secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.5 million, to Pinnacle Family Office Investments, L.P. (\u201cPinnacle\u201d), pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated the same date, herein referred to as the Pinnacle Note. We used the proceeds of the Pinnacle Note to finance the Company's acquisition of The Door. Our obligations under the Pinnacle Note were secured primarily by a lien on the assets of The Door and Viewpoint. The Pinnacle Note matured on January 5, 2020. The Pinnacle Note contained a clause that re-prices the conversion price if we sell equity securities at a price lower than the conversion price at any time that the Pinnacle Note is outstanding. On October 21, 2019, we issued 540,000 shares of common stock pursuant to a public offering at a purchase price of $3.90 per share.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (this \u201c2020 Form 10-K\u201d). The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2020 Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors, in each case contained in this 2020 Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cDLPN\u201d.\nOn August 17, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social Public Relations, LLC, a California LLC referred to as Be Social. Be Social is a Los Angeles based digital communications group representing both brands and highly-engaged digital influencers. As consideration for the acquisition of the membership interest of Be Social we agreed to pay to the seller, Ms. Alison Grant, (i) $1.5 million in cash and 69,907 shares of our common stock on August 17, 2020 and (ii) issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $350,000 on January 4, 2021. We may also pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Ms. Grant has entered into an employment agreement with a term through December 31, 2023.\nThrough our subsidiaries 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in PR services for the respective industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides digital communication capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin's legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O'Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.\nWe have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2021, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2021 or at all.\nWe operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment comprises 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic marketing consulting, digital marketing capabilities, creative branding and in-house production of content for marketing. The content production segment comprises Dolphin Films and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.\nOn March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected our business and demand for certain of our services. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector that has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients have been negatively impacted by the suspension or reduction of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. We have taken steps to align our expenses with our changes in revenue. The steps being taken across the Company include freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending. We continue to believe that our strategic strengths discussed above will continue to assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.\nEffective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split. Shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the following management discussion and analysis.\nGoing Concern\nManagement has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our accumulated deficit, recurring losses and working capital deficit, as of December 31, 2020. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In addition, we operate in industries that have been adversely affected by COVID-19 (e.g. food, hospitality and talent PR). On June 5, 2020, we sold 1.6 million shares and received proceeds in the amount of approximately $7.6 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, as well as available bank and non-bank financing, or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital or securing loans. Any such issuances of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. In April of 2020, we received five separate loans for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169, prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Payroll Protection Program. There is no assurance that our loans will be forgiven. If we are unable to raise additional funds from the sale of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities, bank and non-bank financing or any combination of such financing securities, we may not be able to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nREVENUES\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived substantially all of our revenues from our entertainment publicity and marketing segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment derives its revenues from providing public relations services for celebrities and musicians, entertainment and targeted content marketing for film and television series, strategic communications services for corporations and public relations, marketing services and brand strategies for hotels and restaurants. We additionally derived revenues from the content production segment primarily from the distribution of our feature films, Max Steel and Believe. The table below sets forth the percentage of total revenue derived from our two segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entertainment publicity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment Publicity and Marketing\nOur revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. We believe that we have a stable client base, and we have continued to grow organically through referrals and actively soliciting new business, as well as through acquisition of new businesses within the same industry. We earn revenues primarily from the following sources: (i) celebrity talent services; (ii) content marketing services under multiyear master service agreements in exchange for fixed project-based fees; (iii) individual engagements for entertainment content marketing services for durations of generally between three and six months; (iv) strategic communications services; (v) engagements for marketing of special events such as food and wine festivals; (vi) engagement for marketing of brands; (vii) arranging strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers and (viii) content productions of marketing materials on a project contract basis. For these revenue streams, we collect fees through either fixed fee monthly retainer agreements, fees based on a percentage of contracts or project-based fees.\nWe earn entertainment publicity and marketing revenues primarily through the following:\n\u00b7\nTalent - We earn fees from creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including Oscar, Tony and Emmy winning film, theater and television stars, directors, producers, celebrity chefs and Grammy winning recording artists. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio and/or network liaison work, and event and tour support.\n\u00b7\nEntertainment Marketing and Brand Strategy- We earn fees from providing marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for entertainment content (including theatrical films, television programs, DVD and VOD releases, and online series) from all the major studios, as well as content producers ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. In addition, we provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, food and wine festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red-carpet management. As part of our services, we offer marketing and publicity services tailored to reach diverse audiences. We also provide marketing direction targeted to the ideal consumer through a creative public relations and creative brand strategy for hotel and restaurant groups. Our clients for this type of service include major studios, streaming services, independent producers and leading hotel and restaurant groups. We expect that increased digital streaming marketing budgets at several large key clients will drive growth of revenue and profit in 42West's Entertainment Marketing division over the next several years.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Communications - We earn fees by advising companies looking to create, raise or reposition their public profiles, primarily in the entertainment industry. We believe that growth in Strategic Communications division will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients who are expanding their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products PR sectors. We expect that this growth trend will continue for the next three to five years. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies, as well as high-profile individuals address sensitive situations.\n\u00b7\nCreative Branding and Production - We offer clients creative branding and production services from concept creation to final delivery. Our services include brand strategy, concept and creative development, design and art direction, script and copyrighting, live action production and photography, digital development, video editing and composite, animation, audio mixing and engineering, project management and technical support. We expect that our ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries, will be accretive to our revenue.\n\u00b7\nDigital Media Influencer Marketing Campaigns - We arrange strategic marketing agreements between brands and social media influencers, for both organic and paid campaigns. We also offer services for social media activations at events, as well as editorial work on behalf of brand clients. Our services extend beyond our own captive influencer network, and we manage custom campaigns targeting specific demographics and locations, from ideation to delivery of results reports. We expect that our relationship with social media influencers will provide us the ability to offer these services to our existing clients in the entertainment and consumer products industries and will be accretive to our revenue.\nContent Production\nProject Development and Related Services\nWe have a team that dedicates a portion of its time to identifying scripts, story treatments and novels for acquisition, development and production. The scripts can be for either digital or motion picture productions. We have acquired the rights to certain scripts that we intend to produce and release in the future, subject to obtaining financing. We have not yet determined if these projects would be produced for digital, television or theatrical distribution.\nOur pipeline of feature films includes:\n\u00b7\nYoungblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic and;\n\u00b7\nSisters Before Misters, a comedy about two estranged sisters finding their way back to each other after a misunderstanding causes one of them to have to plan the other's wedding.\n\u00b7\nOut of their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband versus wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and\nWe have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production once financing is obtained. We are planning to fund these projects through third-party financing arrangements, domestic distribution advances, pre-sales, and location-based tax credits, and if necessary, sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to produce any of these feature films.\nEXPENSES\nOur expenses consist primarily of: (1) direct costs; (2) selling, general and administrative expenses; (3) depreciation and amortization expense; (4) legal and professional fees and (5) payroll expenses.\nDirect costs include certain cost of services, as well as certain production costs, related to our entertainment publicity and marketing business. Included within direct costs are immaterial impairments for any of our content production projects.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all overhead costs except for payroll, depreciation and amortization and legal and professional fees that are reported as a separate expense item.\nDepreciation and amortization include the depreciation of our property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and leasehold improvements.\nLegal and professional fees include fees paid to our attorneys, fees for investor relations consultants, audit and accounting fees and fees for general business consultants.\nPayroll expenses include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits.\nOther Income and Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other income and expenses consisted primarily of: (1) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (2) acquisition costs; (3) changes in the fair value of put rights; (4) changes in fair value of contingent consideration; (5) changes in fair value of warrants; (6) changes in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities and (7) interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also had a loss on the deconsolidation of our Max Steel variable interest entity.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were as follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Entertainment publicity and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,946,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,915,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content production\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,054,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,001,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues from entertainment publicity and marketing decreased by approximately $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease a result of COVID-19 and its effects on food and hospitality sector and the talent division. Government imposed orders to either reduce or completely shut down the in-restaurant service has caused our clients to either reduce or suspend the services we offer. As the production of content was halted between mid-March 2020 and July 2020, several of our talent clients requested to suspend their services during this period until the recommencement of production.\nRevenues from content production increased by $0.02 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Revenues for the content production segment are currently derived from either Max Steel or Believe, feature films that were released in 2016 and 2013, respectively, and our nearing the end of their normal revenue cycles.\nOn August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender of the prints and advertising loan and agreed to give them up $0.9 million of future domestic distribution revenue in exchange for the payment and full satisfaction of the prints and advertising loan in the amount of $0.7 million, including accrued interest, on the date of the agreement. We do not expect to receive any significant future revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel.\nExpenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating expenses were as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,576,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,043,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,822,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,799,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,030,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,946,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and professional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,191,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,560,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,990,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,735,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,610,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,087,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall expenses decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is related to the changes described below.\nDirect costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct costs for Viewpoint are primarily costs attributable to the production costs of each of their projects. The decrease in direct costs is primarily related to a decrease in Viewpoint's revenue due to COVID-19, as well as reduced direct client costs at 42West and The Door from a slowdown in business from COVID-19.\nDirect costs attributable to the content production segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.05 million, mainly attributable to the impairment of script costs. Direct costs related to the content production segment were approximately $0.8 million for 2019. During 2019, direct costs for the content production segment consisted primarily of impairment of capitalized production for Max Steel as a result of the agreement to direct all future domestic film revenues up to $0.9 million to the print and advertising loan's creditor, in settlement of said loan. We evaluate capitalized production costs to determine if the fair value of the capitalized production costs is below the carrying value. Based on management's estimate of ultimate revenues for Max Steel, the capitalized production costs in the amount of $0.6 million were determined to be above fair value and were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses for Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and four months of selling, general and administrative expenses for Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization had an immaterial increase of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to the amortization of intangible assets of Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and Be Social acquired in August 2020.\nLegal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in audit fees and certain legal fees.\nPayroll expenses decreased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In response to the business slowdown due to COVID-19, the certain staff salaries were reduced during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of Shore Fire and Be Social payroll expense.\nOther Income and Expenses\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,311,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on deconsolidation of Max Steel VIE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,484,591\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,042\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of put rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,745,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,880,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of convertible notes and derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(534,627\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(275,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and debt amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,133,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,545,206\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,339,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million primarily related to the Max Steel VIE. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the production service agreement confirmed that the Max Steel VIE did not owe them any debt. We reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE. As a result, we deconsolidated the Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of approximately $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14-(Variable Interest Entities) to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our analysis of primary beneficiary status.\nAs previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed to exchange up to $0.9 million of future domestic revenues of Max Steel for the extinguishment of the prints and advertising loan and recorded $0.7 million of a gain on the extinguishment of that debt.\nAcquisition costs consisted primarily of legal, consulting and auditing costs related to our acquisitions. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of Be Social in August 2020. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of costs associated with our acquisition of Shore Fire in December 2019.\nThe fair value of put rights related to the 42West acquisition were recorded on our balance sheet on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the put rights is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the puts was $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of The Door and Be Social were recorded on our balance sheet on July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent consideration is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss of $0.06 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a gain of approximately $0.2 million and was related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for The Door.\nWe elected the fair value option for certain convertible notes issued in 2020. The embedded conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note meets the criteria for a derivative. The fair value of these notes and embedded conversion feature are remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature of $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net income.\nWarrants issued with each of the 2019 and 2020 Lincoln Park convertible notes payable and Series \u201cI\u201d warrant were each initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of these warrants increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense and debt amortization decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to convertible promissory notes that were converted into shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion on these notes payable.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe had an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary component of the income tax benefit in both years is due to a release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities of the companies acquired.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $46.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, we have approximately $26.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14.9 million of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3.9 million, approximately $4.3 million of New York state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038, approximately $3.9 million of New York city net operating loss carryforwards that being to expire in 2038, approximately $0.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031, and approximately $1.3 million of Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nIn assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we have accordingly recorded a net valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was approximately $(1.9) million or $(0.35) per share based on 5,619,969 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(0.58) per share based on 6,382,937 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net loss was approximately $(2.3) million or $(0.70) per share based on 3,304,585 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(1.20) per share based on 4,285,101 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the factors discussed above.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.5 million. Our net loss of approximately $1.9 million contained non-cash items such as gain on extinguishment of debt and changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $1.3 million resulting in $0.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, primarily from the increase of accounts receivable for projects completed by The Door and Viewpoint at year end. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.9 million. Our net loss of approximately $2.3 million contained non-cash items such as changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $0.3 million resulting in $2.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $0.3 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million primarily related to (i) a payment of deferred cash consideration for the Shore Fire acquisition in the amount of $0.3 million, (ii) a payment of approximately $1.0 million, net of cash acquired for the Be Social acquisition and $0.08 for fixed assets purchased. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $0.9 million and were primarily related to approximately $0.8 million for the purchase of Shore Fire, net of cash acquired and approximately $0.1 million for the purchase of fixed assets.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $8.6 million as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of the net of (i) $0.5 million to paydown the line of credit with Bank United; (ii) $0.3 million of principal and interest payments for the term loan with Bank United; (iii) $1.6 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iv) $0.3 million comprising the final installment of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (v) $1.9 million to repay convertible notes that matured, including $0.7 million to a related party, Leslee Dart, a member of the Board of Directors; (vi) $0.8 million consideration paid in installments as deferred cash consideration to the seller of Shore Fire; (vii) $7.6 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a registered direct offering in June of 2020 and (viii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3.6 million. By contrast, cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.4 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of (i) $0.1 million of net repayment of debt related to Max Steel; (ii) $2.3 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iii) $0.3 million comprising the second and third installments of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (iv) second installment of the consideration for The Door in the amount of $0.8 million; (v) final installment of the consideration paid to employees of 42West to settle change of control provisions in their employment contracts in the amount of $0.4 million; (vi) $1.9 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a public offering in October 2019; (vii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $2.1 million and (viii) proceeds from non-convertible note payable of $0.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash available for working capital of approximately $7.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, not including $0.7 million pledged as collateral for standby letter of credit for the New York office, and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.\nOur net losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, along with an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.0 million as of December 31, 2020, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2020 Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Such issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. We currently have the rights to several scripts, that we intend to produce and release subject to obtaining financing. We will potentially earn a producer and overhead fee for this production. There can be no assurances that such production will be released or fees will be realized in future periods.\nOur subsidiaries operate in industries that were adversely affected by the government mandated shelter-in-place, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we entered into five separate loan agreements and received an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no assurance that our obligation under these loans will be forgiven.\nIn addition, we have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $10.9 million and our total stockholders' equity was approximately $19.7 million. Approximately $1.5 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 represents the fair value of put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 is related to PPP Loans received that may be forgiven upon application to the lender for qualifying expenditures primarily related to payroll costs.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nFinancing Arrangements\nPrints and Advertising Loan\nOn August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, or Max Steel Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the P&A Loan, providing for a $14.5 million non-revolving credit facility that matured on August 25, 2017. The loan was not guaranteed by any other Dolphin entity and the only asset held by Max Steel Holdings is the copyright for the motion picture. The loan was also secured by $1,250,000 in a deposit account and a third-party guarantee of $4,500,000, of which Dolphin agreed to backstop $620,000. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay a portion of the P&A expenses of the domestic distribution of our feature film, Max Steel. During 2017 the lender applied the $1,250,000 in the deposit account and the third-party guarantor paid the $4,500,000 to reduce the loan balance. Repayment of the loan was intended to be made from revenues generated by Max Steel in the United States. Max Steel did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan prior to the maturity date. On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender whereby they are entitled to the next $0.9 million of revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel in exchange for payment and satisfaction in full of the P&A Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million related to this revenue participation agreement.\nProduction Service Agreement\nDuring 2014, the Max Steel variable interest entity (or Max Steel VIE), created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel, entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $10.4 million to produce Max Steel. The loan was partially secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The agreement contained repayment milestones to be made during 2015, which were not met and, as such, accrued interest at a default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited until the maturity date of January 31, 2016 or the release of the movie. Due to delays in the release of the film, Max Steel VIE was unable to make some of the scheduled payments and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Max Steel VIE accrued $1.6 million of interest at the default rate. The film was released in theaters in the United States on October 14, 2016 and delivery to the international distributors began after the US release. On February 20, 2020, the Company received notification from the lender of the Production Service Agreement that the Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt to the lender. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3.3 million during year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a balance of $0 and $3.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets related to the Production Service Agreement.\n42West Line of Credit\nOn March 15, 2018, 42West entered into a business loan agreement with BankUnited, N.A., (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), for a revolving line of credit agreement under a revolving note. The revolving line of credit matured on March 15, 2020 and bore interest on the outstanding balance at the bank's prime rate plus 0.25% per annum. The maximum amount that could be drawn on the revolving line of credit was $2,300,000. Amounts outstanding under the note were secured by 42West's current and future inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles. On March 28, 2018, we drew $1,690,000 from the line of credit facility to purchase 36,659 shares of our common stock, per the put agreements with the sellers of 42West. On February 20, 2020, in anticipation of converting the line of credit into a term loan, we partially repaid the line of credit in the amount of $500,000. On March 31, 2020 we converted the line of credit into a three-year term loan in the amount of $1,200,390. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the loan recorded on our balance sheet was $1,700,390.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender's Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the balance on the term loan was $900,292.\nThe Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door's insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our calculations, we believe we are out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we have classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nPromissory Notes\nNonconvertible Notes\nOn November 5, 2019, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $350,000 that matures two years after issuance. We may prepay this promissory note with no penalty after the initial six months. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nOn December 10, 2018, we agreed to exchange an unsecured promissory note with a principal balance of $300,000 that had been issued in 2012 and accrued interest of $192,233, for a new unsecured promissory note in the amount of $492,233 that matures on December 10, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and provides for monthly repayments of principal and interest in the amount of $10,459 beginning January 15, 2019. The promissory note may be repaid at any time prior to maturity without a penalty.\nOn November 30, 2017, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $200,000 that initially matured on January 15, 2021 and has been extended until January 15, 2022. We may prepay this promissory note with no penalty at any time. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nOn June 14, 2017, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $400,000 that matures two years after issuance. We agreed to extend the maturity date until June 14, 2021.We may prepay this promissory note with no penalty after the initial six months. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nWe have a balance of $846,749, net of debt discount, in current liabilities and $426,645, in noncurrent liabilities, and accrued interest of $8,273 in current liabilities related to these notes payable on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2020, we paid $132,264 of interest related to these notes and recorded interest expense of $131,750 on our statement of operations.\nConvertible Notes\n2020 Fair Value Convertible Notes\nOn January 3, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC and issued a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $1.3 million at a purchase price of $1.2 million, herein referred to as the 2020 Lincoln Park Note, together with warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.91 per share. The securities purchase agreement provides for issuance of warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of our common stock on each of the second, fourth, and sixth month anniversaries of the securities purchase agreement if the principal balance has not been paid on such dates. As such, on March 4, May 4, and July 3, 2020 we issued warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of our common stock and including the warrants issued on January 3, 2020 are collectively referred to as the 2020 Lincoln Park Warrants. The 2020 Lincoln Park Note has an original issue discount of $100,000 and does not bear interest unless there is an event of default. The 2020 Lincoln Park Note may be converted at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to the lower of (A) $5.25 per share and (B) the lower of (i) the lowest intraday sales price of our common stock on the applicable conversion date and (ii) the average of the three lowest closing sales prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive trading days including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date but under no circumstances lower than $3.91 per share. The 2020 Lincoln Park Note matures on January 3, 2022. The proceeds of the 2020 Lincoln Park Note were used to repay Pinnacle Note described below. On July 14, and August 17, 2020, Lincoln Park converted $360,000 and $400,000, respectively, of the principal balance of the convertible promissory note into 82,192 and 89,989 shares, respectively, of our common stock at a purchase price of $4.35 and $4.45, respectively.\nOn January 3, 2020, in connection with the securities purchase agreement with Lincoln Park discussed above, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which we agreed to register any shares converted into our common stock pursuant to the terms of the convertible promissory note with Lincoln Park, if during the six-month period commencing on the date of the Registration Rights Agreement, we determine to file a resale registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn March 4, 2020, we issued a convertible promissory note to a third-party investor in the principal amount of $500,000 and received $500,000. We also issued a warrant to purchase up to 20,000 shares of our common stock at purchase price of $3.91 per share. The convertible promissory note bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures on March 4, 2030. The balance of the convertible promissory note and any accrued interest may be converted at the note holder's option at any time at a purchase price $3.91 per share of our common stock.\nOn March 25, 2020, we issued a convertible promissory note to a third-party investor for a principal amount of $560,000 and received $500,000, net of transaction costs of $10,000 and original issue discount. The Company also issued 10,000 shares of our common stock related to this convertible note payable. The maturity date of the convertible promissory note is March 25, 2021 and the balance of the convertible promissory note and any accrued interest may be converted at the noteholder's option at any time at a purchase price $3.90 per share of our common stock. On each of January 13 and 27, 2021, the noteholder converted $280,000, for the total principal amount of $560,000 and received 143,588 shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a balance of $580,000 and $947,293, respectively in current and noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Due to the changes in the fair value of the convertible promissory notes, we recorded a loss of $534,627 under the caption change in fair value of derivative liability on our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $29,370 of interest and recorded interest expense of $32,658 on our consolidated statement of operations related to these convertible notes payable at fair value.\nConvertible Notes with Bifurcated Conversion Features\nOn May 20, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC and issued a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $1.1 million at a purchase price of $1.0 million, herein referred to as the 2019 Lincoln Park Note, together with warrants to purchase up to 27,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share. The securities purchase agreement provides for issuance of warrants to purchase up to 27,500 shares of our common stock on each of the second, fourth, and sixth month anniversaries of the securities purchase agreement if the principal balance has not been paid on such dates.
