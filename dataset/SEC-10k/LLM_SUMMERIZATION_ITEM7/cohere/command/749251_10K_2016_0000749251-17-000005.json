The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness.\nWe had total revenues of $2.4 billion in 2016, an increase of 13% over 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Diluted earnings per share was $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015, a 12% increase, primarily driven by higher net income, which increased 10% in 2016, and to a lesser extent, a lower weighted-average share count, which declined 1%.\nResearch revenues increased 16% year-over-year, to $1.83 billion in 2016, and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 17%. The contribution margin was 69%, the same as 2015. At December 31, 2016, total contract value was $1.93 billion, an increase of 9% over December 31, 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Both client and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104%, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nConsulting revenues increased 6% in 2016, to $346.2 million, while the impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The gross contribution margin was 31% in 2016 compared to 33% in 2015. Consultant utilization was 66% in both periods. We had 628 billable consultants at December 31, 2016 compared to 606 at year-end 2015. Backlog was $103.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nEvents revenues increased 7% year-over-year, to $268.6 million in 2016. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, Events revenues increased 6%. The segment contribution margin was 51% in 2016 compared to 52% in 2015. We held 66 events in 2016 compared to 65 in 2015, while the number of attendees increased 4% in 2016, to 54,602.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below.\nCash flow from our operating activities was $365.6 million in 2016, an increase of 6% compared to 2015. Our 2016 cash flow from operating activities benefited from the early adoption of FASB ASU 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards (see Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). We ended 2016 with $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents while $1.1 billion was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line.\nWe continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. During 2016 we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we also acquired two businesses. In addition, in January 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB Inc., an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights (see Note 16 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nFLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS\nOur quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; acquisitions; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. On-going changes to our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP as well as SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB No. 104\u201d). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all of the conditions related to their payment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference, summit, or exhibition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.\nUncollectible fees receivable - We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients, and probable losses. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients' liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients' ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts.\nThe following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands) as of:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fees receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for losses\n</td> <td>(7,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees receivable, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic No. 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nASC Topic No. 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. If our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. A quantitative analysis requires management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the Company's weighted-average cost of capital, and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units.\nWe conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair values of all of the Company's reporting units during the third quarter of 2016. The results of this test concluded that the fair values of the Company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.\nAccounting for income taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107\u201d) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110\u201d). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period (see Note 8 - Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company's common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company's stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. In 2016 the Company early adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" ASU No. 2016-09 requires certain changes in accounting for stock compensation under FASB ASC Topic No. 718. Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.\nRestructuring and other accruals - We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs.

COS expense increased 14% in 2016 when compared to 2015 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $88.0 million in higher\npayroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $28.6 million in higher charges in 2016 for events costs and other program related expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $10.0 million in foreign exchange impact. Overall COS headcount increased 13%, which was primarily in our Research segment. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2016 and 2015 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $126.5 million in 2016, or 13%, to $1,089.2 million compared to $962.7 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 15% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $115.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.5 million in additional legal, recruiting and training, and workplace costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was approximately $16.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 13% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 12% year-over-year, to 2,423 at December 31, 2016 from 2,171 at year-end 2015.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $24.8 million in 2016 from $13.3 million in 2015 due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $42.6 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting and severance costs.\nOPERATING INCOME increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015, to $305.1 million in 2016 from $288.0 million in 2015. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12% in 2016 and 13% in 2015 with the decline due to a number of factors, to include lower gross contribution margins in our Consulting and Events segments and higher charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 21% year-over-year due to higher average borrowings in the 2016 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the State of Connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities. Other income (expense), net was $5.0 million in 2015, which consisted of a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $94.8 million in 2016 compared to $96.6 million in 2015 and the effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2016 compared to 35.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in 2016, partially offset by increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions.\nNET INCOME was $193.6 million in 2016 and $175.6 million in 2015, an increase of 10%. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year, to $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015 due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2016 period.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Increase\n(Decrease)\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Increase\n(Decrease)\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,163,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,021,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services & product development\n</td> <td>839,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>962,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>33,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,603\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>13,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition & integration charges\n</td> <td>26,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>287,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(20,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>4,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(96,576\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTOTAL REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $141.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on COS expense during 2015, and adjusted for this impact, COS expense increased 11% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $56.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $31.0 million in higher charges in 2015 for events costs, travel, and other corporate expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $46.0 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. The additional headcount was\nprimarily in our Research business which includes the additional employees resulting from our 2015 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount in our Consulting business. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2015 and 2014 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $86.6 million in 2015, or 10%, to $962.7 million compared to $876.1 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $111.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.0 million in additional travel and training, recruiting, and other costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was $51.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 17% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 15% year-over-year, to 2,171 at December 31, 2015 from 1,881 at year-end 2014.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $13.3 million in 2015 from $8.2 million 2014, an increase of 62% year-over-year due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $26.2 million in 2015 compared to $21.9 million in 2014.

Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2015 and 14% in 2014, with the decrease primarily driven by higher year-over-year SG&A costs, and to a lesser extent a lower gross contribution in the Consulting business and additional charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 91% year-over-year due to additional borrowings in the 2015 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $5.0 million in 2015 which included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss resulting from foreign currency hedging activities. The $0.6 million expense in 2014 was due to a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $96.6 million in 2015 compared to $90.9 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate was 35.5% for 2015 compared to 33.1% for 2014. The higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in foreign tax credit benefits, increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions, and increases in valuation allowances on foreign net operating losses.\nNET INCOME was $175.6 million in 2015 and $183.8 million in 2014, a decrease of 4%. Diluted earnings per share increased 1% year-over-year, to $2.06 in 2015 compared to $2.03 in 2014, due to a 6% decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2015 period.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.\nResearch\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Research segment as of and for the year ended December 31: Table 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$1,829,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,583,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,583,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,445,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution (1)\n</td> <td>$1,267,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,096,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,096,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,001,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution margin\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract value (1), (2)\n</td> <td>$1,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,768,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,768,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,605,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research contract value (1), (3)\n</td> <td>$1,922,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,760,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,760,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,603,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Client retention\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wallet retention\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>In thousands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, Research revenues increased 17% in 2016. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. The contribution margin remained at 69% in spite of a 14% increase in segment headcount, mostly driven by new hires and to a lesser extent the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. The headcount increase reflects our continuing investment in this business. Total contract value increased 9% on a reported basis in 2016 to $1.93 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. The growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region and client size and virtually every industry sector growing at double-digit percentage rates. We increased the number of our research client enterprises by 3% in 2016, to 11,122. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104% respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nResearch segment revenues increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 16% in 2015. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. Total contract value increased 10% in 2015 to $1.77 billion. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, total contract value increased 14% year-over-year. The number of research client enterprises increased by 8% in 2015, to 10,796.

Revenue in our contract optimization practice increased slightly but declined in our strategic advisory service (\"SAS\") practice. The impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 2 points, due to several factors, including higher payroll costs resulting from higher headcount and severance, as well as the revenue decline in our SAS practice, which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting. Backlog decreased by $13.9 million year-over-year, or 12%, mostly due to a large individual contract booked in 2015. Excluding that contract, backlog decreased by about 4% year-over-year. The $103.8 million of backlog at year-end 2016 represents approximately 4 months of forward backlog, which is in line with the Company's operational target.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nConsulting revenue decreased 6% year-over-year but was essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The revenue decline was primarily in our core consulting practice, which was mainly driven by the foreign exchange impact. We also had lower revenues in our contract optimization practice, which can fluctuate from period to period. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 1 point, primarily driven by costs resulting from higher headcount. Backlog increased by $15.1 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $117.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nEvents\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Events segment as of and for the year ended December 31:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$268,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$251,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$251,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$227,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution (1)\n</td> <td>$136,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$130,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$130,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$112,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution margin\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of events\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of attendees\n</td> <td>54,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Dollars in thousands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 VERSUS 2015\nEvents revenues increased $16.8 million when comparing 2016 to 2015, or 7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, revenues increased 6% year-over-year. We held 66 events in 2016, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 7 new events, compared to 65 events in 2015. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our on-going events, which increased 9%, while attendee revenue increased 2%. The number of attendees in 2016 increased 4% to 54,602. Average revenue per attendee declined slightly while average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. The gross contribution margin decreased 1 point year-over-year.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nEvents revenues increased $24.1 million when comparing 2015 to 2014, or 11%, and increased 18% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. We held 65 events in 2015, consisting of 61 ongoing events and 4 new events, compared to 61 events in 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to higher attendee revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher exhibitor revenue. The number of attendees increased 7% in 2015, and the number of exhibitors increased 4%. Average revenue per attendee rose 9% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 2%. The gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in June 2016 that provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver and $1.1 billion of available revolver borrowing capacity under the 2016 Credit Agreement. We had $474.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, a $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB and to modify certain covenants.\nWe have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment. Revenues in our Research segment increased 16% in 2016 compared to 2015, and constituted 75% and 73% of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our Research customer contracts are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume.\nWe had operating cash flow of $365.6 million in 2016 compared to $345.6 million in 2015. During 2016 we used $125.0 million in cash to pay down debt and related fees and we used almost $50.0 million in cash for capital expenditures. We also used $34.2 million in cash in 2016 to acquire other businesses and $59.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The amount of cash used in 2016 to acquire other businesses and for stock repurchases was significantly less than 2015. We currently have a $1.2 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the Company's common stock, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.1 billion of this authorization remains.\nDefinitive Agreement to Acquire CEB Inc.\nOn January 5, 2017, the Company and CEB announced that they entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB in a transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Gartner is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion in cash and $0.8 billion of Gartner common stock. Gartner will also assume (and refinance) approximately $0.9 billion in CEB debt. Closing of the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017.\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter for the purposes of financing the majority of the cash consideration payable and to refinance CEB's indebtedness. The commitment letter provides for a total of $2.275 billion in additional financing, which includes a seven-year senior secured term loan B facility of up to $1.375 billion, a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility of up to $300.0 million, and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million. It is expected that on or prior to the closing of the CEB acquisition, senior unsecured notes will be issued and sold pursuant to an offering pursuant to Rule 144A or a private placement in lieu of a portion of, or all of the drawings under, the high-yield bridge facility. The Company expects that the proceeds from the additional financing described above, together with its balance sheet cash and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and refinance CEB's indebtedness, as well as pay for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The closing of the transaction and related borrowings will significantly increase the Company's outstanding debt.\nCash and cash equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2016, approximately $432.0 million of our total $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the U.S. Of the $432.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States at December 31, 2016, approximately $340.0 million represents accumulated undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S. operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings.\nHowever, future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or U.S. tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings. As a result, we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three-years ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(84,049\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(242,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(242,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(162,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by financing activities\n</td> <td>(174,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,690\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,690\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(208,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>106,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,668\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>(5,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>During 2016, the Company early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU No. 2016-09\"), which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards. The adoption of the standard increased our 2016 operating cash flow by $10.0 million with a corresponding decrease in financing activities. Our financial results for periods prior to 2016 were not impacted. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 VERSUS 2015\nOperating\nOperating cash flow increased by $20.1 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. Partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs, bonus and commissions, and interest on our borrowings.\nInvesting\nWe used $84.0 million of cash in our investing activities in 2016 compared to $242.4 million of cash used in 2015. Cash used in 2015 was substantially higher due to additional expenditures for acquisitions.\nFinancing\nCash used was $174.7 million in 2016, which consisted of $59.0 million paid for share repurchases and $125.0 million for payments and fees on debt, which was partially offset by $9.3 million in cash realized from employee share-related activities. In the 2015 period the Company used $67.7 million in cash in its financing activities, with $509.0 million in cash used for share repurchases, while net borrowings on debt and employee share-related activities provided cash of $441.3 million.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nOperating\nOperating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014. The decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower 2015 net income, as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions, income taxes, and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period. Partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period.\nInvesting\nWe used an additional $79.6 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015. In total, we used $196.2 million and $124.3 million of cash (net of the cash acquired) for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions. We also used an additional $7.6 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period, with a total of $46.1 million used in 2015 compared to $38.5 million in 2014.\nFinancing\nIn total, we used $67.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2015 compared to $208.7 million of cash used in 2014. The Company used $509.0 million of cash for share repurchases in 2015 compared to $432.0 million used for share repurchases in 2014. The Company borrowed an additional $420.0 million in 2015 on a net basis compared to $200.0 million of net additional borrowings in 2014. Additions to financing cash flows from employee share-based activities were $21.4 million in 2015 and $28.0 million in 2014.\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n2016 Credit Agreement\nThe Company's 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB, and to modify certain covenants. Under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Agreement in 2021. The term and revolving facilities may be increased, at the Company's option, by up to an additional $750.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver. See Note 5 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2016, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nContractual Cash Commitments\nThe Company has certain commitments that contractually require future cash payments.

ASU No. 2017-01 changes the GAAP definition of a business which can impact the accounting for asset purchases, acquisitions, goodwill impairment, and other assessments. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nStatement of Cash Flows - In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, \"Restricted Cash\" (\"ASU No. 2016-18\"). ASU No. 2016-18 requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be presented with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. If different, a reconciliation of the cash balances reported in the cash flow statement and the balance sheet would need to be provided along with explanatory information. ASU No. 2016-18 is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes - In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \"Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\" (\"ASU No. 2016-16\"). ASU No. 2016-16 accelerates the recognition of taxes on certain intra-entity transactions and is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2018. Current GAAP requires deferral of the income tax implications of an intercompany sale of assets until the assets are sold to a third party or recovered through use. Under the new rule, the seller's tax effects and the buyer's deferred taxes will be immediately recognized upon the sale. We have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of ASU No. 2016-16 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted but could impact the timing of recognition of taxes on future intra-entity transfers.\nStatement of Cash Flows - In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\" (\"ASU No. 2016-15\"). ASU No. 2016-15 sets forth classification requirements for certain cash flow transactions. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2018, but early adoption is permitted. We have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial Instrument Credit Losses - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses\" (\"ASU No. 2016-13\"). ASU No. 2016-13 amends the current financial instrument impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU No. 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nLeases - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases\" (\"ASU No. 2016-02\") which will require significant changes in the accounting and disclosure for lease arrangements. Currently under U.S. GAAP, lease arrangements that meet certain criteria are considered operating leases and are not recorded on the balance sheet. All of the Company's existing lease arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and are thus not recorded on the Company's balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-02 will significantly change the accounting for leases since a right-of-use (\"ROU\") model must be used in which the lessee must record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating arrangements, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU No. 2016-02 will be effective for Gartner on January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments Recognition and Measurement - In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instruments Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities\" (\"ASU No. 2016-01\") to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among the significant changes required by ASU No. 2016-01 is that equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU No. 2016-01 will be effective for Gartner on January 1, 2018. We have completed an initial evaluation of the impact of ASU No. 2016-01 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but may require additional disclosures.\nRevenue - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 and related amendments require changes in revenue recognition policies as well as enhanced disclosures. ASU No. 2014-09 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing\nrevenue recognition rules; provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue recognition issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosures. We have completed an initial assessment of the impact of ASU No. 2014-09 on our existing revenue recognition policies and we plan to adopt the rule on January 1, 2018 using the cumulative effect method of adoption. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires significantly expanded disclosures around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, which we are currently compiling. While we have not completed our assessment of the impact of ASU No. 2014-09, based on the analysis completed to date, we do not currently anticipate that the new rule will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB also continues to work on a number of other accounting rules which if issued could impact our accounting policies and disclosures in future periods.

The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness.\nWe had total revenues of $2.4 billion in 2016, an increase of 13% over 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Diluted earnings per share was $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015, a 12% increase, primarily driven by higher net income, which increased 10% in 2016, and to a lesser extent, a lower weighted-average share count, which declined 1%.\nResearch revenues increased 16% year-over-year, to $1.83 billion in 2016, and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 17%. The contribution margin was 69%, the same as 2015. At December 31, 2016, total contract value was $1.93 billion, an increase of 9% over December 31, 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Both client and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104%, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nConsulting revenues increased 6% in 2016, to $346.2 million, while the impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The gross contribution margin was 31% in 2016 compared to 33% in 2015. Consultant utilization was 66% in both periods. We had 628 billable consultants at December 31, 2016 compared to 606 at year-end 2015. Backlog was $103.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nEvents revenues increased 7% year-over-year, to $268.6 million in 2016. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, Events revenues increased 6%. The segment contribution margin was 51% in 2016 compared to 52% in 2015. We held 66 events in 2016 compared to 65 in 2015, while the number of attendees increased 4% in 2016, to 54,602.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below.\nCash flow from our operating activities was $365.6 million in 2016, an increase of 6% compared to 2015. Our 2016 cash flow from operating activities benefited from the early adoption of FASB ASU 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards (see Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). We ended 2016 with $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents while $1.1 billion was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line.\nWe continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. During 2016 we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we also acquired two businesses. In addition, in January 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB Inc., an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights (see Note 16 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nFLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS\nOur quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; acquisitions; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. On-going changes to our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP as well as SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB No. 104\u201d). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:\n \u2022 Research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors. \n \u2022 Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all of the conditions related to their payment. \n \u2022 Events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference, summit, or exhibition. \nThe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.\nUncollectible fees receivable - We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients, and probable losses. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients' liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients' ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts.\nThe following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands) as of:\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic No. 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nASC Topic No. 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. If our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. A quantitative analysis requires management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the Company's weighted-average cost of capital, and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units.\nWe conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair values of all of the Company's reporting units during the third quarter of 2016. The results of this test concluded that the fair values of the Company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.\nAccounting for income taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107\u201d) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110\u201d). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period (see Note 8 - Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company's common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company's stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. In 2016 the Company early adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" ASU No. 2016-09 requires certain changes in accounting for stock compensation under FASB ASC Topic No. 718. Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.\nRestructuring and other accruals - We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\n2016 VERSUS 2015\nThe following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nTOTAL REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $281.5 million, or 13%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, total revenues increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. Year-over-year reported segment revenues increased by 16% in our Research segment, 6% in Consulting and 7% in Events.\nThe following table presents total revenues by geographic region for the years ended (in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment for the years ended (in thousands):\n\nPlease see the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results\u201d for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.\nCOST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS\") expense increased $106.6 million, or 13%, in 2016 compared to 2015, to $945.6 million compared to $839.1 million in 2015. COS expense increased 14% in 2016 when compared to 2015 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $88.0 million in higher\npayroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $28.6 million in higher charges in 2016 for events costs and other program related expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $10.0 million in foreign exchange impact. Overall COS headcount increased 13%, which was primarily in our Research segment. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2016 and 2015 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $126.5 million in 2016, or 13%, to $1,089.2 million compared to $962.7 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 15% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $115.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.5 million in additional legal, recruiting and training, and workplace costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was approximately $16.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 13% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 12% year-over-year, to 2,423 at December 31, 2016 from 2,171 at year-end 2015.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $24.8 million in 2016 from $13.3 million in 2015 due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $42.6 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting and severance costs.\nOPERATING INCOME increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015, to $305.1 million in 2016 from $288.0 million in 2015. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12% in 2016 and 13% in 2015 with the decline due to a number of factors, to include lower gross contribution margins in our Consulting and Events segments and higher charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 21% year-over-year due to higher average borrowings in the 2016 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the State of Connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities. Other income (expense), net was $5.0 million in 2015, which consisted of a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $94.8 million in 2016 compared to $96.6 million in 2015 and the effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2016 compared to 35.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in 2016, partially offset by increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions.\nNET INCOME was $193.6 million in 2016 and $175.6 million in 2015, an increase of 10%. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year, to $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015 due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2016 period.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nTOTAL REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $141.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues increased by double-digits in our Research and Events businesses but declined 6% in Consulting. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, total revenues increased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe following table presents total revenues by geographic region for the years ended (in thousands):\n\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment for the years ended (in thousands):\n\nPlease refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results\u201d for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.\nCOST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS\") expense increased $41.1 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, to $839.1 million compared to $797.9 million in 2014. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on COS expense during 2015, and adjusted for this impact, COS expense increased 11% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $56.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $31.0 million in higher charges in 2015 for events costs, travel, and other corporate expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $46.0 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. The additional headcount was\nprimarily in our Research business which includes the additional employees resulting from our 2015 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount in our Consulting business. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2015 and 2014 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $86.6 million in 2015, or 10%, to $962.7 million compared to $876.1 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $111.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.0 million in additional travel and training, recruiting, and other costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was $51.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 17% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 15% year-over-year, to 2,171 at December 31, 2015 from 1,881 at year-end 2014.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $13.3 million in 2015 from $8.2 million 2014, an increase of 62% year-over-year due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $26.2 million in 2015 compared to $21.9 million in 2014. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting, and severance costs.\nOPERATING INCOME increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, to $288.0 million in 2015 from $286.2 million in 2014. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2015 and 14% in 2014, with the decrease primarily driven by higher year-over-year SG&A costs, and to a lesser extent a lower gross contribution in the Consulting business and additional charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 91% year-over-year due to additional borrowings in the 2015 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $5.0 million in 2015 which included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss resulting from foreign currency hedging activities. The $0.6 million expense in 2014 was due to a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $96.6 million in 2015 compared to $90.9 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate was 35.5% for 2015 compared to 33.1% for 2014. The higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in foreign tax credit benefits, increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions, and increases in valuation allowances on foreign net operating losses.\nNET INCOME was $175.6 million in 2015 and $183.8 million in 2014, a decrease of 4%. Diluted earnings per share increased 1% year-over-year, to $2.06 in 2015 compared to $2.03 in 2014, due to a 6% decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2015 period.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.\nResearch\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Research segment as of and for the year ended December 31: \n \n (1) In thousands. \n (2) Total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts. It is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Total contract value primarily includes Research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, as well as other deliverables (primarily Events tickets) for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized. \n (3) Research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nResearch segment revenues increased 16% in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, Research revenues increased 17% in 2016. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. The contribution margin remained at 69% in spite of a 14% increase in segment headcount, mostly driven by new hires and to a lesser extent the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. The headcount increase reflects our continuing investment in this business. Total contract value increased 9% on a reported basis in 2016 to $1.93 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. The growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region and client size and virtually every industry sector growing at double-digit percentage rates. We increased the number of our research client enterprises by 3% in 2016, to 11,122. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104% respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nResearch segment revenues increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 16% in 2015. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. Total contract value increased 10% in 2015 to $1.77 billion. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, total contract value increased 14% year-over-year. The number of research client enterprises increased by 8% in 2015, to 10,796. Client retention and wallet retention were 84% and 105% respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nConsulting\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Consulting segment as of and for the year ended December 31:\n\n \n (1) Dollars in thousands. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nConsulting revenue increased 6% year-over-year, to $346.2 million, with the increase mostly in our core consulting practice. Revenue in our contract optimization practice increased slightly but declined in our strategic advisory service (\"SAS\") practice. The impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 2 points, due to several factors, including higher payroll costs resulting from higher headcount and severance, as well as the revenue decline in our SAS practice, which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting. Backlog decreased by $13.9 million year-over-year, or 12%, mostly due to a large individual contract booked in 2015. Excluding that contract, backlog decreased by about 4% year-over-year. The $103.8 million of backlog at year-end 2016 represents approximately 4 months of forward backlog, which is in line with the Company's operational target.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nConsulting revenue decreased 6% year-over-year but was essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The revenue decline was primarily in our core consulting practice, which was mainly driven by the foreign exchange impact. We also had lower revenues in our contract optimization practice, which can fluctuate from period to period. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 1 point, primarily driven by costs resulting from higher headcount. Backlog increased by $15.1 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $117.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nEvents\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Events segment as of and for the year ended December 31:\n\n \n (1) Dollars in thousands. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nEvents revenues increased $16.8 million when comparing 2016 to 2015, or 7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, revenues increased 6% year-over-year. We held 66 events in 2016, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 7 new events, compared to 65 events in 2015. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our on-going events, which increased 9%, while attendee revenue increased 2%. The number of attendees in 2016 increased 4% to 54,602. Average revenue per attendee declined slightly while average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. The gross contribution margin decreased 1 point year-over-year.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nEvents revenues increased $24.1 million when comparing 2015 to 2014, or 11%, and increased 18% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. We held 65 events in 2015, consisting of 61 ongoing events and 4 new events, compared to 61 events in 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to higher attendee revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher exhibitor revenue. The number of attendees increased 7% in 2015, and the number of exhibitors increased 4%. Average revenue per attendee rose 9% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 2%. The gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in June 2016 that provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver and $1.1 billion of available revolver borrowing capacity under the 2016 Credit Agreement. We had $474.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, a $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB and to modify certain covenants.\nWe have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment. Revenues in our Research segment increased 16% in 2016 compared to 2015, and constituted 75% and 73% of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our Research customer contracts are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume.\nWe had operating cash flow of $365.6 million in 2016 compared to $345.6 million in 2015. During 2016 we used $125.0 million in cash to pay down debt and related fees and we used almost $50.0 million in cash for capital expenditures. We also used $34.2 million in cash in 2016 to acquire other businesses and $59.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The amount of cash used in 2016 to acquire other businesses and for stock repurchases was significantly less than 2015. We currently have a $1.2 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the Company's common stock, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.1 billion of this authorization remains.\nDefinitive Agreement to Acquire CEB Inc.\nOn January 5, 2017, the Company and CEB announced that they entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB in a transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Gartner is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion in cash and $0.8 billion of Gartner common stock. Gartner will also assume (and refinance) approximately $0.9 billion in CEB debt. Closing of the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017.\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter for the purposes of financing the majority of the cash consideration payable and to refinance CEB's indebtedness. The commitment letter provides for a total of $2.275 billion in additional financing, which includes a seven-year senior secured term loan B facility of up to $1.375 billion, a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility of up to $300.0 million, and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million. It is expected that on or prior to the closing of the CEB acquisition, senior unsecured notes will be issued and sold pursuant to an offering pursuant to Rule 144A or a private placement in lieu of a portion of, or all of the drawings under, the high-yield bridge facility. The Company expects that the proceeds from the additional financing described above, together with its balance sheet cash and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and refinance CEB's indebtedness, as well as pay for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The closing of the transaction and related borrowings will significantly increase the Company's outstanding debt.\nCash and cash equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2016, approximately $432.0 million of our total $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the U.S. Of the $432.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States at December 31, 2016, approximately $340.0 million represents accumulated undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S. operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings.\nHowever, future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or U.S. tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings. As a result, we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three-years ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n \n (1) During 2016, the Company early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU No. 2016-09\"), which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards. The adoption of the standard increased our 2016 operating cash flow by $10.0 million with a corresponding decrease in financing activities. Our financial results for periods prior to 2016 were not impacted. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nOperating\nOperating cash flow increased by $20.1 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. Partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs, bonus and commissions, and interest on our borrowings.\nInvesting\nWe used $84.0 million of cash in our investing activities in 2016 compared to $242.4 million of cash used in 2015. Cash used in 2015 was substantially higher due to additional expenditures for acquisitions.\nFinancing\nCash used was $174.7 million in 2016, which consisted of $59.0 million paid for share repurchases and $125.0 million for payments and fees on debt, which was partially offset by $9.3 million in cash realized from employee share-related activities. In the 2015 period the Company used $67.7 million in cash in its financing activities, with $509.0 million in cash used for share repurchases, while net borrowings on debt and employee share-related activities provided cash of $441.3 million.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nOperating\nOperating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014. The decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower 2015 net income, as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions, income taxes, and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period. Partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period.\nInvesting\nWe used an additional $79.6 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015. In total, we used $196.2 million and $124.3 million of cash (net of the cash acquired) for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions. We also used an additional $7.6 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period, with a total of $46.1 million used in 2015 compared to $38.5 million in 2014.\nFinancing\nIn total, we used $67.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2015 compared to $208.7 million of cash used in 2014. The Company used $509.0 million of cash for share repurchases in 2015 compared to $432.0 million used for share repurchases in 2014. The Company borrowed an additional $420.0 million in 2015 on a net basis compared to $200.0 million of net additional borrowings in 2014. Additions to financing cash flows from employee share-based activities were $21.4 million in 2015 and $28.0 million in 2014.\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n2016 Credit Agreement\nThe Company's 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB, and to modify certain covenants. Under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Agreement in 2021. The term and revolving facilities may be increased, at the Company's option, by up to an additional $750.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver. See Note 5 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2016, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nContractual Cash Commitments\nThe Company has certain commitments that contractually require future cash payments. The following table summarizes the Company's contractual cash commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n \n (1) Amounts borrowed under the Company's 2016 Credit Agreement, which matures in December 2021, have been classified in the table based on both contractual and anticipated repayment dates. Interest payments were based on the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2016. See", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness.\nWe had total revenues of $2.4 billion in 2016, an increase of 13% over 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Diluted earnings per share was $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015, a 12% increase, primarily driven by higher net income, which increased 10% in 2016, and to a lesser extent, a lower weighted-average share count, which declined 1%.\nResearch revenues increased 16% year-over-year, to $1.83 billion in 2016, and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 17%. The contribution margin was 69%, the same as 2015. At December 31, 2016, total contract value was $1.93 billion, an increase of 9% over December 31, 2015 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Both client and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104%, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\nConsulting revenues increased 6% in 2016, to $346.2 million, while the impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The gross contribution margin was 31% in 2016 compared to 33% in 2015. Consultant utilization was 66% in both periods. We had 628 billable consultants at December 31, 2016 compared to 606 at year-end 2015. Backlog was $103.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nEvents revenues increased 7% year-over-year, to $268.6 million in 2016. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, Events revenues increased 6%. The segment contribution margin was 51% in 2016 compared to 52% in 2015. We held 66 events in 2016 compared to 65 in 2015, while the number of attendees increased 4% in 2016, to 54,602.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below.\nCash flow from our operating activities was $365.6 million in 2016, an increase of 6% compared to 2015. Our 2016 cash flow from operating activities benefited from the early adoption of FASB ASU 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards (see Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information). We ended 2016 with $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents while $1.1 billion was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line.\nWe continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. During 2016 we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we also acquired two businesses. In addition, in January 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB Inc., an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights (see Note 16 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nFLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS\nOur quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; acquisitions; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. On-going changes to our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP as well as SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB No. 104\u201d). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:\n \u2022 Research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors. \n \u2022 Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all of the conditions related to their payment. \n \u2022 Events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference, summit, or exhibition. \nThe majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.\nUncollectible fees receivable - We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients, and probable losses. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients' liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients' ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts.\nThe following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands) as of:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fees receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>650,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for losses\n</td> <td>(7,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees receivable, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>580,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic No. 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nASC Topic No. 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. If our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. A quantitative analysis requires management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the Company's weighted-average cost of capital, and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units.\nWe conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair values of all of the Company's reporting units during the third quarter of 2016. The results of this test concluded that the fair values of the Company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.\nAccounting for income taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107\u201d) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110\u201d). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period (see Note 8 - Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company's common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company's stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. In 2016 the Company early adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" ASU No. 2016-09 requires certain changes in accounting for stock compensation under FASB ASC Topic No. 718. Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.\nRestructuring and other accruals - We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs.

COS expense increased 14% in 2016 when compared to 2015 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $88.0 million in higher\npayroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $28.6 million in higher charges in 2016 for events costs and other program related expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $10.0 million in foreign exchange impact. Overall COS headcount increased 13%, which was primarily in our Research segment. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2016 and 2015 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $126.5 million in 2016, or 13%, to $1,089.2 million compared to $962.7 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 15% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $115.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.5 million in additional legal, recruiting and training, and workplace costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was approximately $16.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 13% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 12% year-over-year, to 2,423 at December 31, 2016 from 2,171 at year-end 2015.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $24.8 million in 2016 from $13.3 million in 2015 due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $42.6 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting and severance costs.\nOPERATING INCOME increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015, to $305.1 million in 2016 from $288.0 million in 2015. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12% in 2016 and 13% in 2015 with the decline due to a number of factors, to include lower gross contribution margins in our Consulting and Events segments and higher charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 21% year-over-year due to higher average borrowings in the 2016 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the State of Connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities. Other income (expense), net was $5.0 million in 2015, which consisted of a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $94.8 million in 2016 compared to $96.6 million in 2015 and the effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2016 compared to 35.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in 2016, partially offset by increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions.\nNET INCOME was $193.6 million in 2016 and $175.6 million in 2015, an increase of 10%. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year, to $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015 due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2016 period.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Increase\n(Decrease)\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Increase\n(Decrease)\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,163,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,021,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services & product development\n</td> <td>839,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>962,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>876,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>33,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,603\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>13,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition & integration charges\n</td> <td>26,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>287,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(20,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,895\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>4,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>(96,576\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTOTAL REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $141.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on COS expense during 2015, and adjusted for this impact, COS expense increased 11% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $56.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $31.0 million in higher charges in 2015 for events costs, travel, and other corporate expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $46.0 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. The additional headcount was\nprimarily in our Research business which includes the additional employees resulting from our 2015 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount in our Consulting business. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2015 and 2014 periods.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A\u201d) expense increased by $86.6 million in 2015, or 10%, to $962.7 million compared to $876.1 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $111.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.0 million in additional travel and training, recruiting, and other costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was $51.0 million in foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 17% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 15% year-over-year, to 2,171 at December 31, 2015 from 1,881 at year-end 2014.\nDEPRECIATION expense increased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $13.3 million in 2015 from $8.2 million 2014, an increase of 62% year-over-year due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.\nACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $26.2 million in 2015 compared to $21.9 million in 2014.

Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2015 and 14% in 2014, with the decrease primarily driven by higher year-over-year SG&A costs, and to a lesser extent a lower gross contribution in the Consulting business and additional charges from acquisitions.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 91% year-over-year due to additional borrowings in the 2015 period.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $5.0 million in 2015 which included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by a net loss resulting from foreign currency hedging activities. The $0.6 million expense in 2014 was due to a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $96.6 million in 2015 compared to $90.9 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate was 35.5% for 2015 compared to 33.1% for 2014. The higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in foreign tax credit benefits, increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions, and increases in valuation allowances on foreign net operating losses.\nNET INCOME was $175.6 million in 2015 and $183.8 million in 2014, a decrease of 4%. Diluted earnings per share increased 1% year-over-year, to $2.06 in 2015 compared to $2.03 in 2014, due to a 6% decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2015 period.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.\nResearch\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Research segment as of and for the year ended December 31: Table 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$1,829,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,583,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,583,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,445,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution (1)\n</td> <td>$1,267,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,096,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,096,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,001,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution margin\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contract value (1), (2)\n</td> <td>$1,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,768,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,768,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,605,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research contract value (1), (3)\n</td> <td>$1,922,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,760,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,760,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,603,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Client retention\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wallet retention\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) In thousands. \n (2) Total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, Research revenues increased 17% in 2016. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. The contribution margin remained at 69% in spite of a 14% increase in segment headcount, mostly driven by new hires and to a lesser extent the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. The headcount increase reflects our continuing investment in this business. Total contract value increased 9% on a reported basis in 2016 to $1.93 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. The growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region and client size and virtually every industry sector growing at double-digit percentage rates. We increased the number of our research client enterprises by 3% in 2016, to 11,122. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 104% respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nResearch segment revenues increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 16% in 2015. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. Total contract value increased 10% in 2015 to $1.77 billion. Adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, total contract value increased 14% year-over-year. The number of research client enterprises increased by 8% in 2015, to 10,796. Client retention and wallet retention were 84% and 105% respectively, as of December 31, 2015.\nConsulting\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Consulting segment as of and for the year ended December 31:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$346,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$327,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$327,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$348,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution (1)\n</td> <td>$107,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$107,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$107,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$119,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution margin\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2) points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Backlog (1)\n</td> <td>$103,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$117,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$117,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$102,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billable headcount\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consultant utilization\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2) points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Dollars in thousands. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nConsulting revenue increased 6% year-over-year, to $346.2 million, with the increase mostly in our core consulting practice. Revenue in our contract optimization practice increased slightly but declined in our strategic advisory service (\"SAS\") practice. The impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 2 points, due to several factors, including higher payroll costs resulting from higher headcount and severance, as well as the revenue decline in our SAS practice, which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting. Backlog decreased by $13.9 million year-over-year, or 12%, mostly due to a large individual contract booked in 2015. Excluding that contract, backlog decreased by about 4% year-over-year. The $103.8 million of backlog at year-end 2016 represents approximately 4 months of forward backlog, which is in line with the Company's operational target.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nConsulting revenue decreased 6% year-over-year but was essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The revenue decline was primarily in our core consulting practice, which was mainly driven by the foreign exchange impact. We also had lower revenues in our contract optimization practice, which can fluctuate from period to period. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 1 point, primarily driven by costs resulting from higher headcount. Backlog increased by $15.1 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $117.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nEvents\nThe following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Events segment as of and for the year ended December 31:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (1)\n</td> <td>$268,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$251,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$251,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$227,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution (1)\n</td> <td>$136,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$130,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$130,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$112,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross contribution margin\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1) point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Measurements:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of events\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of attendees\n</td> <td>54,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Dollars in thousands. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nEvents revenues increased $16.8 million when comparing 2016 to 2015, or 7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, revenues increased 6% year-over-year. We held 66 events in 2016, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 7 new events, compared to 65 events in 2015. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our on-going events, which increased 9%, while attendee revenue increased 2%. The number of attendees in 2016 increased 4% to 54,602. Average revenue per attendee declined slightly while average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. The gross contribution margin decreased 1 point year-over-year.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nEvents revenues increased $24.1 million when comparing 2015 to 2014, or 11%, and increased 18% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. We held 65 events in 2015, consisting of 61 ongoing events and 4 new events, compared to 61 events in 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to higher attendee revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher exhibitor revenue. The number of attendees increased 7% in 2015, and the number of exhibitors increased 4%. Average revenue per attendee rose 9% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 2%. The gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in June 2016 that provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver and $1.1 billion of available revolver borrowing capacity under the 2016 Credit Agreement. We had $474.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016.\nThe 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, a $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB and to modify certain covenants.\nWe have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment. Revenues in our Research segment increased 16% in 2016 compared to 2015, and constituted 75% and 73% of our total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our Research customer contracts are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume.\nWe had operating cash flow of $365.6 million in 2016 compared to $345.6 million in 2015. During 2016 we used $125.0 million in cash to pay down debt and related fees and we used almost $50.0 million in cash for capital expenditures. We also used $34.2 million in cash in 2016 to acquire other businesses and $59.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The amount of cash used in 2016 to acquire other businesses and for stock repurchases was significantly less than 2015. We currently have a $1.2 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the Company's common stock, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.1 billion of this authorization remains.\nDefinitive Agreement to Acquire CEB Inc.\nOn January 5, 2017, the Company and CEB announced that they entered into a definitive agreement whereby Gartner will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB in a transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Gartner is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion in cash and $0.8 billion of Gartner common stock. Gartner will also assume (and refinance) approximately $0.9 billion in CEB debt. Closing of the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017.\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter for the purposes of financing the majority of the cash consideration payable and to refinance CEB's indebtedness. The commitment letter provides for a total of $2.275 billion in additional financing, which includes a seven-year senior secured term loan B facility of up to $1.375 billion, a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility of up to $300.0 million, and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million. It is expected that on or prior to the closing of the CEB acquisition, senior unsecured notes will be issued and sold pursuant to an offering pursuant to Rule 144A or a private placement in lieu of a portion of, or all of the drawings under, the high-yield bridge facility. The Company expects that the proceeds from the additional financing described above, together with its balance sheet cash and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration and refinance CEB's indebtedness, as well as pay for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The closing of the transaction and related borrowings will significantly increase the Company's outstanding debt.\nCash and cash equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2016, approximately $432.0 million of our total $474.2 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the U.S. Of the $432.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States at December 31, 2016, approximately $340.0 million represents accumulated undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S. operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings.\nHowever, future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or U.S. tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings. As a result, we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three-years ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(84,049\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(242,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(242,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(162,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,580\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used by financing activities\n</td> <td>(174,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,690\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,690\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(208,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>106,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,668\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>(5,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) During 2016, the Company early adopted FASB ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU No. 2016-09\"), which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation awards. The adoption of the standard increased our 2016 operating cash flow by $10.0 million with a corresponding decrease in financing activities. Our financial results for periods prior to 2016 were not impacted. See Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n2016 VERSUS 2015\nOperating\nOperating cash flow increased by $20.1 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. Partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs, bonus and commissions, and interest on our borrowings.\nInvesting\nWe used $84.0 million of cash in our investing activities in 2016 compared to $242.4 million of cash used in 2015. Cash used in 2015 was substantially higher due to additional expenditures for acquisitions.\nFinancing\nCash used was $174.7 million in 2016, which consisted of $59.0 million paid for share repurchases and $125.0 million for payments and fees on debt, which was partially offset by $9.3 million in cash realized from employee share-related activities. In the 2015 period the Company used $67.7 million in cash in its financing activities, with $509.0 million in cash used for share repurchases, while net borrowings on debt and employee share-related activities provided cash of $441.3 million.\n2015 VERSUS 2014\nOperating\nOperating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014. The decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower 2015 net income, as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions, income taxes, and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period. Partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period.\nInvesting\nWe used an additional $79.6 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015. In total, we used $196.2 million and $124.3 million of cash (net of the cash acquired) for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions. We also used an additional $7.6 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period, with a total of $46.1 million used in 2015 compared to $38.5 million in 2014.\nFinancing\nIn total, we used $67.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2015 compared to $208.7 million of cash used in 2014. The Company used $509.0 million of cash for share repurchases in 2015 compared to $432.0 million used for share repurchases in 2014. The Company borrowed an additional $420.0 million in 2015 on a net basis compared to $200.0 million of net additional borrowings in 2014. Additions to financing cash flows from employee share-based activities were $21.4 million in 2015 and $28.0 million in 2014.\nOBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\n2016 Credit Agreement\nThe Company's 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB, and to modify certain covenants. Under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Agreement in 2021. The term and revolving facilities may be increased, at the Company's option, by up to an additional $750.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $585.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $115.0 million under the revolver. See Note 5 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2016, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.\nContractual Cash Commitments\nThe Company has certain commitments that contractually require future cash payments.
