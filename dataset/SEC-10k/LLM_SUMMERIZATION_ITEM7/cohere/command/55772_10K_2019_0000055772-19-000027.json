(the Company,\u201d Kimball International,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) has created design-driven, innovative furnishings that have helped our customers shape spaces into places that bring possibility to life by enabling collaboration, discovery, wellness, and relaxation. We go to market through our family of brands: Kimball, National, Kimball Hospitality, David Edward, and D'style by Kimball Hospitality. Our values and integrity are demonstrated daily by embracing our purpose and guiding principles while fostering a culture of caring that establishes us as an employer of choice. We build success through nurturing long-term relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\nWe closely monitor key indicators for the markets in which we compete. As reported by the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer Association ( BIFMA\u201d), the forecast by IHS Markit, a global information provider, as of January 2019 for the North American commercial furniture market, which they define as including office, education, and healthcare furniture\nproducts, projects a year-over-year increase of 3.3% for calendar year 2019. The forecast for two of the leading indicators for the hospitality furniture market in the August 2019 PwC Hospitality Directions U.S. report includes a projected increase in RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) of 1.1% for calendar year 2019 and 1.0% for calendar year 2020, while occupancy levels for calendar 2019 and 2020 continue to hover at peak levels.\nManagement currently considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be most important to understanding our financial condition and operating performance:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>\u2018Kimball International Connect' Strategy - In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company's full potential.

The U.S. government continues to evaluate the ongoing need for tariffs, and if further tariffs are assessed, the landed cost of our products could increase materially, which would reduce our net income if we are unable to mitigate the additional cost.

Open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends.\nIn fiscal year 2019, we recorded net income of $39.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, inclusive of after-tax Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) transition costs of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and after-tax restructuring costs of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding the CEO transition costs and restructuring costs, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2019 was $41.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to increased transportation, commodity and tariff costs, increased employee costs, including healthcare and the negative impact of the David Edward acquisition on gross margin, which we expect will continue in the short-term until productivity improvements and synergies are realized. Our gross margin was favorably impacted by increased product pricing, the savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives, and the leverage gained on higher sales volumes.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 increased 40 basis points. In absolute dollars, selling and administrative spending increased 11%, primarily due to increased retirement and incentive compensation as a result of achieving higher earning levels, the incremental selling and administrative expenses resulting from the D'style and David Edward acquisitions, higher salary expense, the CEO transition costs incurred in fiscal year 2019, and higher commission expense resulting from higher sales levels. In addition, fiscal year 2018 included a $1.0 million higher gain on the sale of assets than was recorded in fiscal year 2019.\nIn June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. We recognized pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2019 related to our transformation restructuring plan.

The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21.0% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years. Our fiscal year 2018 included approximately $3.3 million in reduced income tax expense to reflect federal taxes on taxable income at the lower blended effective tax rate, partially offset by a discrete tax impact of $1.8 million in additional expense as a result of applying the new lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets.\nOur fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate of 23.9% was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate in part due to a $0.3 million research and development tax credit. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was 34.2%, as the benefits of the Tax Act were partially offset by the negative tax impact of applying the lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included a $0.6 million benefit resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction.\nComparing our balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2018, the $7.3 million increase in our inventory balance was primarily driven by the acquisition of David Edward, new products introduced in fiscal year 2019, and inventory intentionally purchased prior to the effective date of certain tariffs. Increases in our accrued incentive compensation and retirement were the largest contributors to the $6.9 million increase in our accrued expenses balance.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year 2018

by both the D'style acquisition and growth in organic hospitality orders. Excluding an approximate $2.0 million positive impact from a price increase for one of our brands which took effect on July 2, 2018 and accelerated orders into our fiscal year 2018, office furniture backlog as of June 30, 2018 was flat.\nIn fiscal year 2018 we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2017 we recorded net income of $37.5 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, inclusive of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of after-tax restructuring gain from the sale of the Idaho facility. Excluding the non-recurring gain, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2017 was $36.4 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, as increased product pricing and lower employee benefit expenses such as healthcare were more than offset by a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, freight cost increases, higher discounting, and an increase in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory reserve. See Note 7 - Inventories of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on LIFO inventory.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 decreased 20 basis points due to the increased sales volumes. In absolute dollars selling and administrative spending increased 1% as the additional selling and administrative expenses of the D'style acquisition, higher salary expense, and higher marketing expenditures to grow the business were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. During fiscal year 2018 we recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an administrative building, and in fiscal year 2017 we recognized $1.2 million of gains on the sale of land.\nFiscal year 2017 included a pre-tax restructuring gain of $1.8 million which included a gain on the sale of our Post Falls, Idaho facility and land of $2.1 million partially offset by restructuring expense of $0.3 million.

The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Our fiscal year 2018 included approximately\n$3.3 million in reduced income tax expense to reflect federal taxes on current year taxable income at the lower blended effective tax rate, partially offset by a discrete tax impact of $1.8 million in additional expense as a result of applying the new lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets.\nOur fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was 34.2%, as the benefits of the Tax Act were partially offset by the negative tax impact of applying the lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included a $0.6 million benefit resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction. Our fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate was 35.4% and included the benefit of $1.5 million resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction. The Tax Act repealed the domestic manufacturing deduction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to $106.3 million at June 30, 2019 from $87.3 million at June 30, 2018, primarily due to $65.0 million of cash flows from operations during fiscal year 2019, which were partially offset by capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of $21.0 million in fiscal year 2019, the return of capital to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends totaling $20.6 million in fiscal year 2019, and a $4.3 million cash outflow for the David Edward acquisition, which has been adjusted for certain post-closing working capital adjustments.\nWorking capital at June 30, 2019 was $96.5 million compared to working capital of $85.1 million at June 30, 2018. The current ratio was 1.7 at both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nOur short-term liquidity available, represented as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments plus the unused amount of our credit facility, totaled $134.8 million at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. We had no credit facility borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal years 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $65.0 million and $46.9 million, respectively, fueled by net income of $39.3 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Changes in working capital balances provided $8.8 million of cash in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2018, changes in working capital balances used $15.2 million and a reduction in deferred income tax and other deferred charges increased cash flow by $9.1 million. Cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2017 totaled $64.8 million, which was impacted by net income of $37.5 million, and changes in working capital balances provided $10.1 million of cash.\nThe $8.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by a combined $4.6 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions and a $6.1 million reduction in prepaid income taxes.\nThe $15.2 million of cash used as a result of changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2018 was partially driven by an increase of $6.7 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an overpayment of estimated income taxes for fiscal year 2018. Statutory federal tax rates declined in the latter half of fiscal year 2018 as the Tax Act was enacted, and we accelerated certain deductions into fiscal year 2018 to take advantage of higher tax rates in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2019. Also contributing was an increase of $5.7 million in our accounts receivable balance, primarily driven by increased sales toward the end of fiscal year 2018.\nThe $10.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by a combined $5.7 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions.\nOur measure of accounts receivable performance, also referred to as Days Sales Outstanding ( DSO\u201d), for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 28 days and 27 days, respectively. We define DSO as the average of monthly accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day's net sales. Our Production Days Supply on Hand ( PDSOH\u201d) of inventory measure for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 44 and 42 days, respectively. We define PDSOH as the average of the monthly net inventory divided by an average day's cost of sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we invested $40.8 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.4 million matured. During fiscal year 2018, we invested $42.5 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.8 million matured. During fiscal year 2017, we invested $42.1 million in available-for-sale securities, and $5.9 million matured. Our short-term investments included municipal bonds, certificates of deposit purchased in the secondary market, and U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities. During fiscal year 2019, we had a cash outflow of $4.3 million for the David Edward acquisition, while during fiscal year 2018 we had a cash outflow of $18.2 million for the D'style acquisition. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we received proceeds from the sale of assets net of selling expenses of $1.3 million, $5.8 million, and $13.2 million respectively, the majority of which related to the sale of a series of Internet protocol addresses in fiscal year 2019, the sale of our fleet of over-the-road tractors and trailers in fiscal year 2018, and the sale of our Idaho facility in fiscal year 2017, respectively. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we reinvested $21.0 million, $22.3 million, and $12.7 million, respectively, into capital investments for the future. The capital investments in both fiscal year 2019 and 2018 were primarily for facility improvements, such as renovations to our corporate headquarters and showrooms, and various manufacturing equipment upgrades to increase automation in production facilities, which is expected to yield future benefits. The capital investments during fiscal year 2017 were primarily for facility improvements such as renovations to showrooms and our corporate headquarters, various manufacturing equipment, and replacements of tractors and trailers in our fleet.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe paid $11.4 million of dividends in fiscal year 2019 compared to paying $10.1 million of dividends in fiscal year 2018 and $8.8 million of dividends in fiscal year 2017. Consistent with our historical dividend policy, our Board of Directors evaluates the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis. We repurchased shares pursuant to a previously announced stock repurchase program, which drove cash outflow of $9.1 million in fiscal year 2019, $8.9 million in fiscal year 2018, and $6.7 million in fiscal year 2017.\nCredit Facility\nWe maintain a $30.0 million credit facility with a maturity date of October 2019 that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings. This facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $55.0 million at our request, subject to the consent of the participating banks. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding. We expect to negotiate a new credit facility to replace this credit facility prior to its October 2019 expiration. However, changing conditions in the credit markets or unforeseen circumstances could adversely impact the replacement of this credit facility.\nThe credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants, the most significant of which are the adjusted leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. The adjusted leverage ratio is defined as (a) consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the U.S. in excess of $15,000,000 to (b) consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters, and may not be greater than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as (a) the sum of (i) consolidated EBITDA, minus (ii) 50% of depreciation expense, minus (iii) taxes paid, minus (iv) dividends and distributions paid, to (b) the sum of (i) scheduled principal payments on indebtedness due and/or paid, plus (ii) interest expense, calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the trailing four fiscal quarters then ending, and may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all debt covenants of the credit facility during fiscal year 2019.\nThe table below compares the adjusted leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Limit As Specified in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Covenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Excess\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Liquidity\nWe believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund future dividends and meet our working capital and other operating needs for at least the next 12 months. During fiscal year 2020, we also anticipate cash outflow of approximately $14.6 million for accrued cash incentive compensation related to our fiscal year 2019 performance and cash outflow of approximately $5 million for restructuring. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, which was paid in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We will continue to evaluate market conditions in determining future share repurchases. At June 30, 2019, 2.7 million shares remained available under the repurchase program. During fiscal year 2020, we expect to continue investments in capital expenditures, particularly for projects such as our headquarters renovation, showroom renovations, machinery and equipment upgrades and automation, as well as for potential acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions, the impact of changes in tariffs, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, loss of key contract customers, and other unforeseen circumstances. In particular, should demand for our products decrease significantly over the next 12 months, the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) contains non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, or statements of shareholders' equity of the company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this MD&A include (1) organic net sales, defined as net sales excluding the acquisition-related net sales during the periods for which there were no sales related to such acquisition in the comparable period; (2) adjusted operating income, defined as operating income excluding restructuring expenses, CEO transition costs, and market value adjustments related to our Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) liability; (3) adjusted operating income percentage, defined as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales; (4) adjusted net income, defined as net income excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (5) adjusted diluted earnings per share, defined as diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (6) adjusted EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; and (7) adjusted EBITDA percentage, defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Reconciliations of the reported GAAP numbers to these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the table below. Management believes it is useful for investors to understand and to be able to meaningfully trend, analyze and benchmark how our core operations performed without market value adjustments related to our SERP liability or expenses incurred in executing our transformation restructuring plan or our CEO transition. Many of our internal performance measures that management uses to make certain operating decisions exclude these expenses to enable meaningful trending of core operating metrics. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative to the GAAP measures and are presented as supplemental information.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

fulfilled and are expected to be recognized as revenue during future quarters. The timing of shipments can vary, but generally open orders are expected to ship within a twelve-month period.\nReturn on Invested Capital is a key performance indicator calculated as: [(Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Amortization) multiplied by (1 minus Effective Tax Rate)] divided by (Total Shareholders' Equity plus Net Debt). Net Debt is defined as current maturities of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nFair Value\nDuring fiscal year 2019, no financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity. Financial assets classified as level 1 assets were valued using readily available market pricing. For commercial paper and available-for-sale securities classified as level 2 assets, the fair values were determined based on market data using evaluated pricing models and incorporating available trade, bid, and other market information. We evaluated the inputs used to value the instruments and validated the accuracy of the instrument fair values based on historical evidence. The investment in stock warrants and equity securities without readily determinable fair value of a privately-held company are classified as level 3 financial assets. The stock warrants are accounted for as a derivative instrument valued on a recurring basis considering the pricing of recent purchases or sales, if any, of the investment, as well as positive and negative qualitative evidence, while the equity securities without readily determinable fair value are accounted for as a cost-method investment which carries the securities at cost, except in the event of impairment. The contingent earn-out liability incurred in the acquisition of D'style is classified as a level 3 financial liability and is valued based on a valuation model that measures the present value of the probable cash payments based upon the forecasted operating performance of the D'style acquisition and a discount rate that captures the risk associated with the liability.\nSee Note 13 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending June 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in Millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023-2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded Contractual Obligations: (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance\nSheet (c) (d) (e)\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecorded Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases (e)\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (f)\n</td> <td>54.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>As of June 30, 2019, we had no capital lease obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Refer to Note 10 - Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long-term debt obligations.

See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the standby letters of credit and operating leases. We do not have material exposures to trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nRevenue recognition - Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, we adopted guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, using a full retrospective method. Under the new guidance, revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring distinct goods or providing services to customers. Our revenue consists substantially of product sales, and is reported net of sales discounts, rebates, incentives, returns, and other allowances offered to customers. We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied, which occurs when control passes to a customer to enable them to direct the use of and obtain benefit from the product. This typically occurs when a customer obtains legal title, obtains the risks and rewards of ownership, has received the goods according to the contractual shipping terms either at the shipping point or destination, and is obligated to pay for the product. Shipping and handling activities are recognized as fulfillment activities and are expensed at the time revenue is recognized. We recognize sales net of applicable sales taxes and similar revenue-based taxes.\nWe use judgment in estimating the reduction in net sales driven by customer rebate and incentive programs. Judgments primarily include expected sales levels to be achieved and the corresponding rebate and incentive amounts expected to be earned by dealers and salespersons.\nWe also use judgment in estimating a reserve for returns and allowances which is recorded at the time of the sale, based on estimated product returns and price concessions. The reserve for returns and allowances is recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and impair receivable balances by recording specific allowances for bad debts based on judgment using factors such as current trends, the length of time the receivables are past due, and historical collection experience. The allowance for accounts receivable balances that are determined likely to be uncollectible are a reduction in the receivables line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSelf-insurance reserves - We are self-insured up to certain limits for automobile and general liability, workers' compensation, and certain employee health benefits such as medical, short-term disability, and dental, with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements. Our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors, including known claims, estimated incurred but not reported claims, and other analyses, which are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions for such matters as a result of increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly. At June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our accrued liabilities for self-insurance exposure were $3.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nTaxes - Deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change management's assessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax provision will be adjusted accordingly. The liability for uncertain income tax and other tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties on those positions, was $1.8 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.9 million at June 30, 2018.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and intangible net asset fair values resulting from business acquisitions. Annually, or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary, we may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. We also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit's fair value to identify impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is written down to its fair value. Goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level. The fair value is established primarily using a discounted cash flow analysis and secondarily a market approach utilizing current industry information. The calculation of the fair value of the reporting unit considers current market conditions existing at the assessment date. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, no goodwill impairment was recognized. At June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, goodwill totaled $11.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding New Accounting Standards.",

    "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Overview\nFor over 65 years, Kimball International, Inc. (the Company,\u201d Kimball International,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) has created design-driven, innovative furnishings that have helped our customers shape spaces into places that bring possibility to life by enabling collaboration, discovery, wellness, and relaxation. We go to market through our family of brands: Kimball, National, Kimball Hospitality, David Edward, and D'style by Kimball Hospitality. Our values and integrity are demonstrated daily by embracing our purpose and guiding principles while fostering a culture of caring that establishes us as an employer of choice. We build success through nurturing long-term relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\nWe closely monitor key indicators for the markets in which we compete. As reported by the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer Association ( BIFMA\u201d), the forecast by IHS Markit, a global information provider, as of January 2019 for the North American commercial furniture market, which they define as including office, education, and healthcare furniture\nproducts, projects a year-over-year increase of 3.3% for calendar year 2019. The forecast for two of the leading indicators for the hospitality furniture market in the August 2019 PwC Hospitality Directions U.S. report includes a projected increase in RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) of 1.1% for calendar year 2019 and 1.0% for calendar year 2020, while occupancy levels for calendar 2019 and 2020 continue to hover at peak levels.\nManagement currently considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be most important to understanding our financial condition and operating performance:\n \u2022 \u2018Kimball International Connect' Strategy - In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company's full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and position our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. We believe this strategy will successfully position us for the future and result in enhanced shareholder value over the long term. Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars: \n \u2022 Inspire Our People: Leveraging our legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are working to cultivate a high-performance, caring culture. We unveiled our new purpose to our employees on May 9, 2019 and are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work. \n \u2022 Build Our Capabilities: We are creating center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal and are centralizing supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. To achieve our goals, we established a Program Management Office to oversee execution. \n \u2022 Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices. \n \u2022 Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including healthcare and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers' first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share. \n \u2022 Transformation Restructuring Plan - In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. The efforts are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $10.0 million when the transformation restructuring plan is fully implemented. We estimate pre-tax restructuring charges incurred through the end of fiscal year 2020 will be approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million. The transformation restructuring plan includes the following: \n \u2022 Our overall manufacturing facility footprint is being reviewed to reduce excess capacity and gain efficiencies. We plan to exit a leased seating manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and are evaluating our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities. \n \u2022 The creation of center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions is expected to result in the standardization of processes and the elimination of duplication. In addition, we are centralizing our supply chain efforts to maximize supplier value and plan to drive more efficient practices and operations within our logistics function. \n \u2022 Kimball brand selling resources are being reallocated to higher-growth markets. We also plan to exit four leased furniture showrooms across our brands during fiscal year 2020. \n \u2022 On October 23, 2018, our Board of Directors ( Board\u201d) appointed Kristine L. Juster as Chief Executive Officer, effective November 1, 2018, to succeed Robert F. Schneider who retired as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board on October 31, 2018. Ms. Juster, an independent member of the Board and a member of the Audit Committee from April 2016 until her appointment as Chief Executive Officer, continues to serve as a member of the Board. Ms. Juster served for over 20 years as a Global Executive at Newell Brands, Inc., a leading global consumer goods and commercial products company ( Newell\u201d), until her retirement from Newell in April 2018. During her tenure at Newell, Ms. Juster served as President of the Global Writing Segment from May 2014 until her retirement in April 2018, as President of Newell's Baby and Parent Segment from November 2011 to April 2014, and in other roles of increasing responsibility since joining Newell in 1995, including serving as President of Newell's Home D\u00e9cor Segment and President of Newell's Culinary Lifestyles Segment. \n \u2022 Productivity and lean initiatives resulted in approximately $10 million of cost savings in fiscal year 2019. These initiatives included investments in equipment and automation at our production facilities to improve production flow and increase \nefficiency, improvements in transportation and warehousing processes, and other various lean initiatives across all areas of our Company.\n \u2022 On October 26, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified limited liabilities of David Edward Furniture, Inc. ( David Edward\u201d), which is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. David Edward is a premier designer and manufacturer of contract furniture, sold in the healthcare, corporate, education, and premium hospitality markets. David Edward products are sold primarily in the North American market. David Edward's products are generally specified by architects and designers, represented through a network of independent representatives, and sold through authorized furniture dealerships. The David Edward product portfolio consists of classic and contemporary designs, focused primarily in the seating, tables, and ancillary furniture categories. In conjunction with the asset acquisition, we leased the two existing David Edward production facilities in Baltimore, Maryland and Red Lion, Pennsylvania. See Note 2 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On November 6, 2017, we successfully completed the acquisition of certain assets of D'style, Inc. ( D'style\u201d) and all of the capital stock of Dise\u00f1os de Estilo S.A. de C.V., which included administrative and sales offices and warehousing in Chula Vista, California and a manufacturing location in Tijuana, Mexico. The acquisition expanded our hospitality offerings beyond guest rooms to public spaces and provided new mixed material manufacturing capabilities. See Note 2 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The statutory federal tax rate was 21.0% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and will be the same in subsequent years. \n \u2022 We expect commodity prices to moderate, but we will continue to be exposed to fluctuations in transportation costs, which vary based upon freight carrier capacity and fuel prices. We utilize both steel and aluminum in our products, most of which is sourced domestically. The U.S. originally imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imported from several countries effective June 2018. The government expanded its list of products subject to tariffs to include furniture products, parts, and components at a 10% rate effective September 2018, increasing to a 25% rate effective June 2019. The U.S. government continues to evaluate the ongoing need for tariffs, and if further tariffs are assessed, the landed cost of our products could increase materially, which would reduce our net income if we are unable to mitigate the additional cost. We are actively striving to offset increases in the cost of these materials through supplier negotiations, global sourcing initiatives, product re-engineering and parts standardization, and price increases on our products. \n \u2022 On February 4, 2019, we received notification from the U.S. General Services Administration Office of Inspector General ( GSA OIG\u201d) in response to our self-reporting in 2016 of subcontractor reporting noncompliance and inaccuracies. The GSA OIG Contractor Reporting Program reviewed the information we provided and determined that the government's interest was sufficiently protected and, as a result, the review of the matter against Kimball International has been terminated. \n \u2022 Due to the contract and project nature of furniture markets, fluctuation in the demand for our products and variation in the gross margin on those projects is inherent to our business, which in turn impacts our operating results. Effective management of our manufacturing capacity is and will continue to be critical to our success. See below for further details regarding current sales and open order trends. \n \u2022 We expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently, including potential acquisitions, that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability. \n \u2022 We have a strong focus on cost control and closely monitor market changes and our liquidity in order to proactively adjust our operating costs, discretionary capital spending, and dividend levels as needed. Managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is likewise key. \n \u2022 We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our short-term liquidity available, represented as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments plus the unused amount of our credit facility, was $134.8 million at June 30, 2019.  A comparison of the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 follows this overview.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nOur fiscal year 2018 results have been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers using the full retrospective transition method.\n\n* Items indicated represent Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measurements for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018.\n** Items indicated represent Key Performance Indicators.\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\n\nFiscal year 2019 consolidated net sales were $768.1 million compared to fiscal year 2018 consolidated net sales of $704.6 million, a 9% increase. Organic net sales increased $49.6 million, or 7%, year-over-year due to both higher volume primarily in our hospitality, healthcare and commercial vertical markets and price increases coupled with lower discounting.\nKey explanatory comments for our sales by vertical market for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 follow:\n \u2022 Sales growth to the healthcare vertical market was driven by our strategic focus in this marketplace, which included aligning resources, building relationships, and introducing new healthcare products. The healthcare market continues to show stability and growth. \n \u2022 We continue to see strength in the hospitality industry, as we had increased sales in both custom and non-custom projects driven by our marketing campaigns, the cyclical nature of the hospitality project business and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of our D'style products. \n \u2022 New products with particular appeal to the corporate workplace and continued development of our strategic relationships, as well as overall general growth in this market, drove the higher sales in the commercial vertical market. \n \u2022 Both an expanded focus beyond higher education customers and the strength of our new education-centric products drove the increased sales to the education vertical market. In addition, sales were positively impacted early in fiscal year 2019, as the timing of the normal education buying season in fiscal year 2018 was delayed and deferred sales into the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We also implemented a new program designed to drive early engagement by our sales representatives in education opportunities during fiscal 2019, which we believe positively impacted our sales to this vertical market. \n \u2022 Our sales to the finance vertical market increased as large financial institutions continued to invest in their office environments. \n \u2022 Government vertical market sales declined primarily due to decreased federal government sales in part due to a decrease in average project size and a partial shift in our focus to other markets. \n \u2022 Each of our vertical market sales levels can fluctuate depending on the mix of projects in a given period.  Open orders at June 30, 2019 increased 8%, or 6% on an organic basis, when compared to the open order level as of June 30, 2018, primarily due to higher office furniture backlog driven by increased organic orders and, to a lesser extent, order backlog of David Edward products. Open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends.\nIn fiscal year 2019, we recorded net income of $39.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, inclusive of after-tax Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) transition costs of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and after-tax restructuring costs of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding the CEO transition costs and restructuring costs, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2019 was $41.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to increased transportation, commodity and tariff costs, increased employee costs, including healthcare and the negative impact of the David Edward acquisition on gross margin, which we expect will continue in the short-term until productivity improvements and synergies are realized. Our gross margin was favorably impacted by increased product pricing, the savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives, and the leverage gained on higher sales volumes.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 increased 40 basis points. In absolute dollars, selling and administrative spending increased 11%, primarily due to increased retirement and incentive compensation as a result of achieving higher earning levels, the incremental selling and administrative expenses resulting from the D'style and David Edward acquisitions, higher salary expense, the CEO transition costs incurred in fiscal year 2019, and higher commission expense resulting from higher sales levels. In addition, fiscal year 2018 included a $1.0 million higher gain on the sale of assets than was recorded in fiscal year 2019.\nIn June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. We recognized pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2019 related to our transformation restructuring plan. See Note 3 - Restructuring Expense of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our transformation restructuring plan.\nOther income (expense), net consisted of the following:\n\nOur fiscal year 2018 results of operations included the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21.0% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years. Our fiscal year 2018 included approximately $3.3 million in reduced income tax expense to reflect federal taxes on taxable income at the lower blended effective tax rate, partially offset by a discrete tax impact of $1.8 million in additional expense as a result of applying the new lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets.\nOur fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate of 23.9% was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate in part due to a $0.3 million research and development tax credit. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was 34.2%, as the benefits of the Tax Act were partially offset by the negative tax impact of applying the lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included a $0.6 million benefit resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction.\nComparing our balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2018, the $7.3 million increase in our inventory balance was primarily driven by the acquisition of David Edward, new products introduced in fiscal year 2019, and inventory intentionally purchased prior to the effective date of certain tariffs. Increases in our accrued incentive compensation and retirement were the largest contributors to the $6.9 million increase in our accrued expenses balance.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nOur fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 results have been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers using the full retrospective transition method.\n\n* Items indicated represent Non-GAAP measurements for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017.\n** Items indicated represent Key Performance Indicators.\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\n\nFiscal year 2018 consolidated net sales were $704.6 million compared to fiscal year 2017 net sales of $693.0 million, a 2% increase, as $13.0 million of net sales resulting from the D'style acquisition and price increases net of higher discounting more than offset decreased organic sales volume.\nKey explanatory comments for our sales by vertical market follow:\n \u2022 For fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, increased hospitality vertical market sales were driven by the acquisition of the D'style business and increases in organic non-custom business, which more than offset a sales decline in our custom business. \n \u2022 Government vertical market sales for fiscal year 2018 increased as state and local government sales increased while sales to the federal government decreased. \n \u2022 Our sales to the education vertical market increased due to our greater focus on this market, despite educational funding being diverted to safety and security products which negatively impacted the timing and size of furniture orders received. \n \u2022 Although sales in the healthcare vertical market declined in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, we experienced a rebound in quoting activity which led to increased shipments and orders in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018. \n \u2022 Each of our vertical market sales levels can fluctuate depending on the mix of projects in a given period.  Open orders at June 30, 2018 increased 12% when compared to the open order level as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to higher hospitality furniture backlog driven by both the D'style acquisition and growth in organic hospitality orders. Excluding an approximate $2.0 million positive impact from a price increase for one of our brands which took effect on July 2, 2018 and accelerated orders into our fiscal year 2018, office furniture backlog as of June 30, 2018 was flat.\nIn fiscal year 2018 we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2017 we recorded net income of $37.5 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, inclusive of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of after-tax restructuring gain from the sale of the Idaho facility. Excluding the non-recurring gain, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2017 was $36.4 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, as increased product pricing and lower employee benefit expenses such as healthcare were more than offset by a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, freight cost increases, higher discounting, and an increase in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory reserve. See Note 7 - Inventories of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on LIFO inventory.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 decreased 20 basis points due to the increased sales volumes. In absolute dollars selling and administrative spending increased 1% as the additional selling and administrative expenses of the D'style acquisition, higher salary expense, and higher marketing expenditures to grow the business were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. During fiscal year 2018 we recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an administrative building, and in fiscal year 2017 we recognized $1.2 million of gains on the sale of land.\nFiscal year 2017 included a pre-tax restructuring gain of $1.8 million which included a gain on the sale of our Post Falls, Idaho facility and land of $2.1 million partially offset by restructuring expense of $0.3 million. See Note 3 - Restructuring Expense of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on restructuring.\nOther income (expense), net consisted of the following:\n\nOur fiscal year 2018 results of operations included the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Our fiscal year 2018 included approximately\n$3.3 million in reduced income tax expense to reflect federal taxes on current year taxable income at the lower blended effective tax rate, partially offset by a discrete tax impact of $1.8 million in additional expense as a result of applying the new lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets.\nOur fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was 34.2%, as the benefits of the Tax Act were partially offset by the negative tax impact of applying the lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included a $0.6 million benefit resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction. Our fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate was 35.4% and included the benefit of $1.5 million resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction. The Tax Act repealed the domestic manufacturing deduction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to $106.3 million at June 30, 2019 from $87.3 million at June 30, 2018, primarily due to $65.0 million of cash flows from operations during fiscal year 2019, which were partially offset by capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of $21.0 million in fiscal year 2019, the return of capital to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends totaling $20.6 million in fiscal year 2019, and a $4.3 million cash outflow for the David Edward acquisition, which has been adjusted for certain post-closing working capital adjustments.\nWorking capital at June 30, 2019 was $96.5 million compared to working capital of $85.1 million at June 30, 2018. The current ratio was 1.7 at both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nOur short-term liquidity available, represented as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments plus the unused amount of our credit facility, totaled $134.8 million at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. We had no credit facility borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal years 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $65.0 million and $46.9 million, respectively, fueled by net income of $39.3 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Changes in working capital balances provided $8.8 million of cash in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2018, changes in working capital balances used $15.2 million and a reduction in deferred income tax and other deferred charges increased cash flow by $9.1 million. Cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2017 totaled $64.8 million, which was impacted by net income of $37.5 million, and changes in working capital balances provided $10.1 million of cash.\nThe $8.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by a combined $4.6 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions and a $6.1 million reduction in prepaid income taxes.\nThe $15.2 million of cash used as a result of changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2018 was partially driven by an increase of $6.7 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an overpayment of estimated income taxes for fiscal year 2018. Statutory federal tax rates declined in the latter half of fiscal year 2018 as the Tax Act was enacted, and we accelerated certain deductions into fiscal year 2018 to take advantage of higher tax rates in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2019. Also contributing was an increase of $5.7 million in our accounts receivable balance, primarily driven by increased sales toward the end of fiscal year 2018.\nThe $10.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by a combined $5.7 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions.\nOur measure of accounts receivable performance, also referred to as Days Sales Outstanding ( DSO\u201d), for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 28 days and 27 days, respectively. We define DSO as the average of monthly accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day's net sales. Our Production Days Supply on Hand ( PDSOH\u201d) of inventory measure for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 44 and 42 days, respectively. We define PDSOH as the average of the monthly net inventory divided by an average day's cost of sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we invested $40.8 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.4 million matured. During fiscal year 2018, we invested $42.5 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.8 million matured. During fiscal year 2017, we invested $42.1 million in available-for-sale securities, and $5.9 million matured. Our short-term investments included municipal bonds, certificates of deposit purchased in the secondary market, and U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities. During fiscal year 2019, we had a cash outflow of $4.3 million for the David Edward acquisition, while during fiscal year 2018 we had a cash outflow of $18.2 million for the D'style acquisition. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we received proceeds from the sale of assets net of selling expenses of $1.3 million, $5.8 million, and $13.2 million respectively, the majority of which related to the sale of a series of Internet protocol addresses in fiscal year 2019, the sale of our fleet of over-the-road tractors and trailers in fiscal year 2018, and the sale of our Idaho facility in fiscal year 2017, respectively. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we reinvested $21.0 million, $22.3 million, and $12.7 million, respectively, into capital investments for the future. The capital investments in both fiscal year 2019 and 2018 were primarily for facility improvements, such as renovations to our corporate headquarters and showrooms, and various manufacturing equipment upgrades to increase automation in production facilities, which is expected to yield future benefits. The capital investments during fiscal year 2017 were primarily for facility improvements such as renovations to showrooms and our corporate headquarters, various manufacturing equipment, and replacements of tractors and trailers in our fleet.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe paid $11.4 million of dividends in fiscal year 2019 compared to paying $10.1 million of dividends in fiscal year 2018 and $8.8 million of dividends in fiscal year 2017. Consistent with our historical dividend policy, our Board of Directors evaluates the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis. We repurchased shares pursuant to a previously announced stock repurchase program, which drove cash outflow of $9.1 million in fiscal year 2019, $8.9 million in fiscal year 2018, and $6.7 million in fiscal year 2017.\nCredit Facility\nWe maintain a $30.0 million credit facility with a maturity date of October 2019 that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings. This facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $55.0 million at our request, subject to the consent of the participating banks. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding. We expect to negotiate a new credit facility to replace this credit facility prior to its October 2019 expiration. However, changing conditions in the credit markets or unforeseen circumstances could adversely impact the replacement of this credit facility.\nThe credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants, the most significant of which are the adjusted leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. The adjusted leverage ratio is defined as (a) consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the U.S. in excess of $15,000,000 to (b) consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters, and may not be greater than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as (a) the sum of (i) consolidated EBITDA, minus (ii) 50% of depreciation expense, minus (iii) taxes paid, minus (iv) dividends and distributions paid, to (b) the sum of (i) scheduled principal payments on indebtedness due and/or paid, plus (ii) interest expense, calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the trailing four fiscal quarters then ending, and may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all debt covenants of the credit facility during fiscal year 2019.\nThe table below compares the adjusted leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement.\n\nFuture Liquidity\nWe believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund future dividends and meet our working capital and other operating needs for at least the next 12 months. During fiscal year 2020, we also anticipate cash outflow of approximately $14.6 million for accrued cash incentive compensation related to our fiscal year 2019 performance and cash outflow of approximately $5 million for restructuring. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, which was paid in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We will continue to evaluate market conditions in determining future share repurchases. At June 30, 2019, 2.7 million shares remained available under the repurchase program. During fiscal year 2020, we expect to continue investments in capital expenditures, particularly for projects such as our headquarters renovation, showroom renovations, machinery and equipment upgrades and automation, as well as for potential acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions, the impact of changes in tariffs, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, loss of key contract customers, and other unforeseen circumstances. In particular, should demand for our products decrease significantly over the next 12 months, the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) contains non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, or statements of shareholders' equity of the company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this MD&A include (1) organic net sales, defined as net sales excluding the acquisition-related net sales during the periods for which there were no sales related to such acquisition in the comparable period; (2) adjusted operating income, defined as operating income excluding restructuring expenses, CEO transition costs, and market value adjustments related to our Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) liability; (3) adjusted operating income percentage, defined as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales; (4) adjusted net income, defined as net income excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (5) adjusted diluted earnings per share, defined as diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (6) adjusted EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; and (7) adjusted EBITDA percentage, defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Reconciliations of the reported GAAP numbers to these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the table below. Management believes it is useful for investors to understand and to be able to meaningfully trend, analyze and benchmark how our core operations performed without market value adjustments related to our SERP liability or expenses incurred in executing our transformation restructuring plan or our CEO transition. Many of our internal performance measures that management uses to make certain operating decisions exclude these expenses to enable meaningful trending of core operating metrics. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative to the GAAP measures and are presented as supplemental information.\n\n\n\nThe open orders metric is a key performance indicator representing firm orders placed by our customers which have not yet been fulfilled and are expected to be recognized as revenue during future quarters. The timing of shipments can vary, but generally open orders are expected to ship within a twelve-month period.\nReturn on Invested Capital is a key performance indicator calculated as: [(Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Amortization) multiplied by (1 minus Effective Tax Rate)] divided by (Total Shareholders' Equity plus Net Debt). Net Debt is defined as current maturities of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nFair Value\nDuring fiscal year 2019, no financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity. Financial assets classified as level 1 assets were valued using readily available market pricing. For commercial paper and available-for-sale securities classified as level 2 assets, the fair values were determined based on market data using evaluated pricing models and incorporating available trade, bid, and other market information. We evaluated the inputs used to value the instruments and validated the accuracy of the instrument fair values based on historical evidence. The investment in stock warrants and equity securities without readily determinable fair value of a privately-held company are classified as level 3 financial assets. The stock warrants are accounted for as a derivative instrument valued on a recurring basis considering the pricing of recent purchases or sales, if any, of the investment, as well as positive and negative qualitative evidence, while the equity securities without readily determinable fair value are accounted for as a cost-method investment which carries the securities at cost, except in the event of impairment. The contingent earn-out liability incurred in the acquisition of D'style is classified as a level 3 financial liability and is valued based on a valuation model that measures the present value of the probable cash payments based upon the forecasted operating performance of the D'style acquisition and a discount rate that captures the risk associated with the liability.\nSee Note 13 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019.\n\n (a) As of June 30, 2019, we had no capital lease obligations. \n (b) Refer to Note 10 - Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long-term debt obligations. Accrued interest is also included on the Long-Term Debt Obligations line. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes less than $0.1 million of long-term debt obligations due in fiscal year 2020, which were recorded as a current liability. \n (c) The timing of payments of certain items included on the Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet\u201d line above is estimated based on the following assumptions: \n \u2022 The timing of long-term SERP payments is estimated based on an assumed retirement age of 62 with payout based on the prior distribution elections of participants. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $3.1 million for SERP payments recorded as current liabilities. \n \u2022 The timing of severance plan payments is estimated based on the average remaining service life of employees. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $0.6 million for employee transition payments related to the transformation restructuring plan and $0.5 million for severance payments, which were both recorded as current liabilities. \n \u2022 The timing of warranty payments is estimated based on historical data. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $0.8 million for short-term warranty payments recorded as a current liability. \n \u2022 The timing of the earn-out liability is contingent upon D'style's operating income for fiscal year 2019 compared to a predetermined target. The amount in the fiscal year 2020 column in the above table includes $0.4 million for earn-out payments recorded as a current liability. \n (d) Excludes $1.6 million of long-term unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties along with deferred tax liabilities and miscellaneous other long-term tax liabilities which are not tied to a contractual obligation and for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments. \n (e) Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding operating leases and certain other long-term liabilities. Executory costs such as property taxes and maintenance are excluded from the operating lease obligations. \n (f) Purchase Obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. The amounts listed above for purchase obligations include contractual commitments for items such as raw materials, supplies, capital expenditures, services, and software acquisitions/license commitments. Cancellable purchase obligations that we intend to fulfill are also included in the purchase obligations amount listed above through fiscal year 2024. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to standby letters of credit and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business. These arrangements do not have a material current effect and are not reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the standby letters of credit and operating leases. We do not have material exposures to trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nRevenue recognition - Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, we adopted guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, using a full retrospective method. Under the new guidance, revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring distinct goods or providing services to customers. Our revenue consists substantially of product sales, and is reported net of sales discounts, rebates, incentives, returns, and other allowances offered to customers. We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied, which occurs when control passes to a customer to enable them to direct the use of and obtain benefit from the product. This typically occurs when a customer obtains legal title, obtains the risks and rewards of ownership, has received the goods according to the contractual shipping terms either at the shipping point or destination, and is obligated to pay for the product. Shipping and handling activities are recognized as fulfillment activities and are expensed at the time revenue is recognized. We recognize sales net of applicable sales taxes and similar revenue-based taxes.\nWe use judgment in estimating the reduction in net sales driven by customer rebate and incentive programs. Judgments primarily include expected sales levels to be achieved and the corresponding rebate and incentive amounts expected to be earned by dealers and salespersons.\nWe also use judgment in estimating a reserve for returns and allowances which is recorded at the time of the sale, based on estimated product returns and price concessions. The reserve for returns and allowances is recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and impair receivable balances by recording specific allowances for bad debts based on judgment using factors such as current trends, the length of time the receivables are past due, and historical collection experience. The allowance for accounts receivable balances that are determined likely to be uncollectible are a reduction in the receivables line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSelf-insurance reserves - We are self-insured up to certain limits for automobile and general liability, workers' compensation, and certain employee health benefits such as medical, short-term disability, and dental, with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements. Our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors, including known claims, estimated incurred but not reported claims, and other analyses, which are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions for such matters as a result of increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly. At June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our accrued liabilities for self-insurance exposure were $3.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nTaxes - Deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change management's assessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax provision will be adjusted accordingly. The liability for uncertain income tax and other tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties on those positions, was $1.8 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.9 million at June 30, 2018.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and",
    "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Overview\nFor over 65 years, Kimball International, Inc. (the Company,\u201d Kimball International,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d) has created design-driven, innovative furnishings that have helped our customers shape spaces into places that bring possibility to life by enabling collaboration, discovery, wellness, and relaxation. We go to market through our family of brands: Kimball, National, Kimball Hospitality, David Edward, and D'style by Kimball Hospitality. Our values and integrity are demonstrated daily by embracing our purpose and guiding principles while fostering a culture of caring that establishes us as an employer of choice. We build success through nurturing long-term relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\nWe closely monitor key indicators for the markets in which we compete. As reported by the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer Association ( BIFMA\u201d), the forecast by IHS Markit, a global information provider, as of January 2019 for the North American commercial furniture market, which they define as including office, education, and healthcare furniture\nproducts, projects a year-over-year increase of 3.3% for calendar year 2019. The forecast for two of the leading indicators for the hospitality furniture market in the August 2019 PwC Hospitality Directions U.S. report includes a projected increase in RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) of 1.1% for calendar year 2019 and 1.0% for calendar year 2020, while occupancy levels for calendar 2019 and 2020 continue to hover at peak levels.\nManagement currently considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be most important to understanding our financial condition and operating performance:\n \u2022 \u2018Kimball International Connect' Strategy - In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company's full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and position our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. We believe this strategy will successfully position us for the future and result in enhanced shareholder value over the long term. Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars: \n \u2022 Inspire Our People: Leveraging our legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are working to cultivate a high-performance, caring culture. We unveiled our new purpose to our employees on May 9, 2019 and are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work. \n \u2022 Build Our Capabilities: We are creating center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal and are centralizing supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. To achieve our goals, we established a Program Management Office to oversee execution. \n \u2022 Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices. \n \u2022 Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including healthcare and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers' first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share. \n \u2022 Transformation Restructuring Plan - In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. The efforts are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $10.0 million when the transformation restructuring plan is fully implemented. We estimate pre-tax restructuring charges incurred through the end of fiscal year 2020 will be approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million. The transformation restructuring plan includes the following: \n \u2022 Our overall manufacturing facility footprint is being reviewed to reduce excess capacity and gain efficiencies. We plan to exit a leased seating manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and are evaluating our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities. \n \u2022 The creation of center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions is expected to result in the standardization of processes and the elimination of duplication. In addition, we are centralizing our supply chain efforts to maximize supplier value and plan to drive more efficient practices and operations within our logistics function. \n \u2022 Kimball brand selling resources are being reallocated to higher-growth markets. We also plan to exit four leased furniture showrooms across our brands during fiscal year 2020. \n \u2022 On October 23, 2018, our Board of Directors ( Board\u201d) appointed Kristine L. Juster as Chief Executive Officer, effective November 1, 2018, to succeed Robert F. Schneider who retired as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board on October 31, 2018. Ms. Juster, an independent member of the Board and a member of the Audit Committee from April 2016 until her appointment as Chief Executive Officer, continues to serve as a member of the Board. Ms. Juster served for over 20 years as a Global Executive at Newell Brands, Inc., a leading global consumer goods and commercial products company ( Newell\u201d), until her retirement from Newell in April 2018. During her tenure at Newell, Ms. Juster served as President of the Global Writing Segment from May 2014 until her retirement in April 2018, as President of Newell's Baby and Parent Segment from November 2011 to April 2014, and in other roles of increasing responsibility since joining Newell in 1995, including serving as President of Newell's Home D\u00e9cor Segment and President of Newell's Culinary Lifestyles Segment. \n \u2022 Productivity and lean initiatives resulted in approximately $10 million of cost savings in fiscal year 2019. These initiatives included investments in equipment and automation at our production facilities to improve production flow and increase \nefficiency, improvements in transportation and warehousing processes, and other various lean initiatives across all areas of our Company.\n \u2022 On October 26, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified limited liabilities of David Edward Furniture, Inc. ( David Edward\u201d), which is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. David Edward is a premier designer and manufacturer of contract furniture, sold in the healthcare, corporate, education, and premium hospitality markets. David Edward products are sold primarily in the North American market. David Edward's products are generally specified by architects and designers, represented through a network of independent representatives, and sold through authorized furniture dealerships. The David Edward product portfolio consists of classic and contemporary designs, focused primarily in the seating, tables, and ancillary furniture categories. In conjunction with the asset acquisition, we leased the two existing David Edward production facilities in Baltimore, Maryland and Red Lion, Pennsylvania. See Note 2 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On November 6, 2017, we successfully completed the acquisition of certain assets of D'style, Inc. ( D'style\u201d) and all of the capital stock of Dise\u00f1os de Estilo S.A. de C.V., which included administrative and sales offices and warehousing in Chula Vista, California and a manufacturing location in Tijuana, Mexico. The acquisition expanded our hospitality offerings beyond guest rooms to public spaces and provided new mixed material manufacturing capabilities. See Note 2 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The statutory federal tax rate was 21.0% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and will be the same in subsequent years. \n \u2022 We expect commodity prices to moderate, but we will continue to be exposed to fluctuations in transportation costs, which vary based upon freight carrier capacity and fuel prices. We utilize both steel and aluminum in our products, most of which is sourced domestically. The U.S. originally imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imported from several countries effective June 2018. The government expanded its list of products subject to tariffs to include furniture products, parts, and components at a 10% rate effective September 2018, increasing to a 25% rate effective June 2019. The U.S. government continues to evaluate the ongoing need for tariffs, and if further tariffs are assessed, the landed cost of our products could increase materially, which would reduce our net income if we are unable to mitigate the additional cost. We are actively striving to offset increases in the cost of these materials through supplier negotiations, global sourcing initiatives, product re-engineering and parts standardization, and price increases on our products. \n \u2022 On February 4, 2019, we received notification from the U.S. General Services Administration Office of Inspector General ( GSA OIG\u201d) in response to our self-reporting in 2016 of subcontractor reporting noncompliance and inaccuracies. The GSA OIG Contractor Reporting Program reviewed the information we provided and determined that the government's interest was sufficiently protected and, as a result, the review of the matter against Kimball International has been terminated. \n \u2022 Due to the contract and project nature of furniture markets, fluctuation in the demand for our products and variation in the gross margin on those projects is inherent to our business, which in turn impacts our operating results. Effective management of our manufacturing capacity is and will continue to be critical to our success. See below for further details regarding current sales and open order trends. \n \u2022 We expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently, including potential acquisitions, that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability. \n \u2022 We have a strong focus on cost control and closely monitor market changes and our liquidity in order to proactively adjust our operating costs, discretionary capital spending, and dividend levels as needed. Managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is likewise key. \n \u2022 We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our short-term liquidity available, represented as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments plus the unused amount of our credit facility, was $134.8 million at June 30, 2019.

2019 consolidated net sales were $768.1 million compared to fiscal year 2018 consolidated net sales of $704.6 million, a 9% increase. Organic net sales increased $49.6 million, or 7%, year-over-year due to both higher volume primarily in our hospitality, healthcare and commercial vertical markets and price increases coupled with lower discounting.\nKey explanatory comments for our sales by vertical market for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 follow:\n \u2022 Sales growth to the healthcare vertical market was driven by our strategic focus in this marketplace, which included aligning resources, building relationships, and introducing new healthcare products. The healthcare market continues to show stability and growth. \n \u2022 We continue to see strength in the hospitality industry, as we had increased sales in both custom and non-custom projects driven by our marketing campaigns, the cyclical nature of the hospitality project business and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of our D'style products. \n \u2022 New products with particular appeal to the corporate workplace and continued development of our strategic relationships, as well as overall general growth in this market, drove the higher sales in the commercial vertical market. \n \u2022 Both an expanded focus beyond higher education customers and the strength of our new education-centric products drove the increased sales to the education vertical market. In addition, sales were positively impacted early in fiscal year 2019, as the timing of the normal education buying season in fiscal year 2018 was delayed and deferred sales into the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We also implemented a new program designed to drive early engagement by our sales representatives in education opportunities during fiscal 2019, which we believe positively impacted our sales to this vertical market. \n \u2022 Our sales to the finance vertical market increased as large financial institutions continued to invest in their office environments. \n \u2022 Government vertical market sales declined primarily due to decreased federal government sales in part due to a decrease in average project size and a partial shift in our focus to other markets. \n \u2022 Each of our vertical market sales levels can fluctuate depending on the mix of projects in a given period.  Open orders at June 30, 2019 increased 8%, or 6% on an organic basis, when compared to the open order level as of June 30, 2018, primarily due to higher office furniture backlog driven by increased organic orders and, to a lesser extent, order backlog of David Edward products. Open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends.\nIn fiscal year 2019, we recorded net income of $39.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, inclusive of after-tax Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) transition costs of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and after-tax restructuring costs of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding the CEO transition costs and restructuring costs, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2019 was $41.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 30 basis points in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to increased transportation, commodity and tariff costs, increased employee costs, including healthcare and the negative impact of the David Edward acquisition on gross margin, which we expect will continue in the short-term until productivity improvements and synergies are realized. Our gross margin was favorably impacted by increased product pricing, the savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives, and the leverage gained on higher sales volumes.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 increased 40 basis points. In absolute dollars, selling and administrative spending increased 11%, primarily due to increased retirement and incentive compensation as a result of achieving higher earning levels, the incremental selling and administrative expenses resulting from the D'style and David Edward acquisitions, higher salary expense, the CEO transition costs incurred in fiscal year 2019, and higher commission expense resulting from higher sales levels. In addition, fiscal year 2018 included a $1.0 million higher gain on the sale of assets than was recorded in fiscal year 2019.\nIn June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. We recognized pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2019 related to our transformation restructuring plan. See Note 3 - Restructuring Expense of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our transformation restructuring plan.\nOther income (expense), net consisted of the following:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income (Expense), net\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan Investments\n</td> <td>673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(235\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income (Expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fiscal year 2018 results of operations included the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates effective January 1, 2018 and changed numerous other provisions. Because we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21.0% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years. Our fiscal year 2018 included approximately $3.3 million in reduced income tax expense to reflect federal taxes on taxable income at the lower blended effective tax rate, partially offset by a discrete tax impact of $1.8 million in additional expense as a result of applying the new lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets.\nOur fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate of 23.9% was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate in part due to a $0.3 million research and development tax credit. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate was 34.2%, as the benefits of the Tax Act were partially offset by the negative tax impact of applying the lower federal income tax rates to our net deferred tax assets. Our fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included a $0.6 million benefit resulting from a domestic manufacturing deduction.\nComparing our balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2018, the $7.3 million increase in our inventory balance was primarily driven by the acquisition of David Edward, new products introduced in fiscal year 2019, and inventory intentionally purchased prior to the effective date of certain tariffs. Increases in our accrued incentive compensation and retirement were the largest contributors to the $6.9 million increase in our accrued expenses balance.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year 2018

compared to fiscal year 2017 net sales of $693.0 million, a 2% increase, as $13.0 million of net sales resulting from the D'style acquisition and price increases net of higher discounting more than offset decreased organic sales volume.\nKey explanatory comments for our sales by vertical market follow:\n \u2022 For fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, increased hospitality vertical market sales were driven by the acquisition of the D'style business and increases in organic non-custom business, which more than offset a sales decline in our custom business. \n \u2022 Government vertical market sales for fiscal year 2018 increased as state and local government sales increased while sales to the federal government decreased. \n \u2022 Our sales to the education vertical market increased due to our greater focus on this market, despite educational funding being diverted to safety and security products which negatively impacted the timing and size of furniture orders received. \n \u2022 Although sales in the healthcare vertical market declined in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, we experienced a rebound in quoting activity which led to increased shipments and orders in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018. \n \u2022 Each of our vertical market sales levels can fluctuate depending on the mix of projects in a given period.  Open orders at June 30, 2018 increased 12% when compared to the open order level as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to higher hospitality furniture backlog driven by both the D'style acquisition and growth in organic hospitality orders. Excluding an approximate $2.0 million positive impact from a price increase for one of our brands which took effect on July 2, 2018 and accelerated orders into our fiscal year 2018, office furniture backlog as of June 30, 2018 was flat.\nIn fiscal year 2018 we recorded net income of $34.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. In fiscal year 2017 we recorded net income of $37.5 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, inclusive of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of after-tax restructuring gain from the sale of the Idaho facility. Excluding the non-recurring gain, our adjusted net income for fiscal year 2017 was $36.4 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\u201d section below.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, as increased product pricing and lower employee benefit expenses such as healthcare were more than offset by a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, freight cost increases, higher discounting, and an increase in our last-in first-out ( LIFO\u201d) inventory reserve. See Note 7 - Inventories of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on LIFO inventory.\nAs a percent of net sales, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 decreased 20 basis points due to the increased sales volumes. In absolute dollars selling and administrative spending increased 1% as the additional selling and administrative expenses of the D'style acquisition, higher salary expense, and higher marketing expenditures to grow the business were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. During fiscal year 2018 we recognized a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an administrative building, and in fiscal year 2017 we recognized $1.2 million of gains on the sale of land.\nFiscal year 2017 included a pre-tax restructuring gain of $1.8 million which included a gain on the sale of our Post Falls, Idaho facility and land of $2.1 million partially offset by restructuring expense of $0.3 million.

The Tax Act repealed the domestic manufacturing deduction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to $106.3 million at June 30, 2019 from $87.3 million at June 30, 2018, primarily due to $65.0 million of cash flows from operations during fiscal year 2019, which were partially offset by capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of $21.0 million in fiscal year 2019, the return of capital to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends totaling $20.6 million in fiscal year 2019, and a $4.3 million cash outflow for the David Edward acquisition, which has been adjusted for certain post-closing working capital adjustments.\nWorking capital at June 30, 2019 was $96.5 million compared to working capital of $85.1 million at June 30, 2018. The current ratio was 1.7 at both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nOur short-term liquidity available, represented as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments plus the unused amount of our credit facility, totaled $134.8 million at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. We had no credit facility borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal years 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $65.0 million and $46.9 million, respectively, fueled by net income of $39.3 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Changes in working capital balances provided $8.8 million of cash in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2018, changes in working capital balances used $15.2 million and a reduction in deferred income tax and other deferred charges increased cash flow by $9.1 million. Cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2017 totaled $64.8 million, which was impacted by net income of $37.5 million, and changes in working capital balances provided $10.1 million of cash.\nThe $8.8 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by a combined $4.6 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions and a $6.1 million reduction in prepaid income taxes.\nThe $15.2 million of cash used as a result of changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2018 was partially driven by an increase of $6.7 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an overpayment of estimated income taxes for fiscal year 2018. Statutory federal tax rates declined in the latter half of fiscal year 2018 as the Tax Act was enacted, and we accelerated certain deductions into fiscal year 2018 to take advantage of higher tax rates in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2019. Also contributing was an increase of $5.7 million in our accounts receivable balance, primarily driven by increased sales toward the end of fiscal year 2018.\nThe $10.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by a combined $5.7 million increase in accrued annual cash incentive compensation and accrued retirement plan contributions.\nOur measure of accounts receivable performance, also referred to as Days Sales Outstanding ( DSO\u201d), for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 28 days and 27 days, respectively. We define DSO as the average of monthly accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day's net sales. Our Production Days Supply on Hand ( PDSOH\u201d) of inventory measure for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were 44 and 42 days, respectively. We define PDSOH as the average of the monthly net inventory divided by an average day's cost of sales.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we invested $40.8 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.4 million matured. During fiscal year 2018, we invested $42.5 million in available-for-sale securities, and $42.8 million matured. During fiscal year 2017, we invested $42.1 million in available-for-sale securities, and $5.9 million matured. Our short-term investments included municipal bonds, certificates of deposit purchased in the secondary market, and U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities. During fiscal year 2019, we had a cash outflow of $4.3 million for the David Edward acquisition, while during fiscal year 2018 we had a cash outflow of $18.2 million for the D'style acquisition. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we received proceeds from the sale of assets net of selling expenses of $1.3 million, $5.8 million, and $13.2 million respectively, the majority of which related to the sale of a series of Internet protocol addresses in fiscal year 2019, the sale of our fleet of over-the-road tractors and trailers in fiscal year 2018, and the sale of our Idaho facility in fiscal year 2017, respectively. During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we reinvested $21.0 million, $22.3 million, and $12.7 million, respectively, into capital investments for the future. The capital investments in both fiscal year 2019 and 2018 were primarily for facility improvements, such as renovations to our corporate headquarters and showrooms, and various manufacturing equipment upgrades to increase automation in production facilities, which is expected to yield future benefits. The capital investments during fiscal year 2017 were primarily for facility improvements such as renovations to showrooms and our corporate headquarters, various manufacturing equipment, and replacements of tractors and trailers in our fleet.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe paid $11.4 million of dividends in fiscal year 2019 compared to paying $10.1 million of dividends in fiscal year 2018 and $8.8 million of dividends in fiscal year 2017. Consistent with our historical dividend policy, our Board of Directors evaluates the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis. We repurchased shares pursuant to a previously announced stock repurchase program, which drove cash outflow of $9.1 million in fiscal year 2019, $8.9 million in fiscal year 2018, and $6.7 million in fiscal year 2017.\nCredit Facility\nWe maintain a $30.0 million credit facility with a maturity date of October 2019 that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings. This facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $55.0 million at our request, subject to the consent of the participating banks. At June 30, 2019, we had $1.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. At both June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding. We expect to negotiate a new credit facility to replace this credit facility prior to its October 2019 expiration. However, changing conditions in the credit markets or unforeseen circumstances could adversely impact the replacement of this credit facility.\nThe credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants, the most significant of which are the adjusted leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. The adjusted leverage ratio is defined as (a) consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the U.S. in excess of $15,000,000 to (b) consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters, and may not be greater than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as (a) the sum of (i) consolidated EBITDA, minus (ii) 50% of depreciation expense, minus (iii) taxes paid, minus (iv) dividends and distributions paid, to (b) the sum of (i) scheduled principal payments on indebtedness due and/or paid, plus (ii) interest expense, calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters for the trailing four fiscal quarters then ending, and may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all debt covenants of the credit facility during fiscal year 2019.\nThe table below compares the adjusted leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Limit As Specified in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Covenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Excess\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Liquidity\nWe believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund future dividends and meet our working capital and other operating needs for at least the next 12 months. During fiscal year 2020, we also anticipate cash outflow of approximately $14.6 million for accrued cash incentive compensation related to our fiscal year 2019 performance and cash outflow of approximately $5 million for restructuring. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, which was paid in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We will continue to evaluate market conditions in determining future share repurchases. At June 30, 2019, 2.7 million shares remained available under the repurchase program. During fiscal year 2020, we expect to continue investments in capital expenditures, particularly for projects such as our headquarters renovation, showroom renovations, machinery and equipment upgrades and automation, as well as for potential acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions, the impact of changes in tariffs, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, loss of key contract customers, and other unforeseen circumstances. In particular, should demand for our products decrease significantly over the next 12 months, the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) contains non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, or statements of shareholders' equity of the company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this MD&A include (1) organic net sales, defined as net sales excluding the acquisition-related net sales during the periods for which there were no sales related to such acquisition in the comparable period; (2) adjusted operating income, defined as operating income excluding restructuring expenses, CEO transition costs, and market value adjustments related to our Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) liability; (3) adjusted operating income percentage, defined as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales; (4) adjusted net income, defined as net income excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (5) adjusted diluted earnings per share, defined as diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; (6) adjusted EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excluding restructuring expenses and CEO transition costs; and (7) adjusted EBITDA percentage, defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Reconciliations of the reported GAAP numbers to these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the table below. Management believes it is useful for investors to understand and to be able to meaningfully trend, analyze and benchmark how our core operations performed without market value adjustments related to our SERP liability or expenses incurred in executing our transformation restructuring plan or our CEO transition. Many of our internal performance measures that management uses to make certain operating decisions exclude these expenses to enable meaningful trending of core operating metrics. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative to the GAAP measures and are presented as supplemental information.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

fulfilled and are expected to be recognized as revenue during future quarters. The timing of shipments can vary, but generally open orders are expected to ship within a twelve-month period.\nReturn on Invested Capital is a key performance indicator calculated as: [(Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Amortization) multiplied by (1 minus Effective Tax Rate)] divided by (Total Shareholders' Equity plus Net Debt). Net Debt is defined as current maturities of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nFair Value\nDuring fiscal year 2019, no financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity. Financial assets classified as level 1 assets were valued using readily available market pricing. For commercial paper and available-for-sale securities classified as level 2 assets, the fair values were determined based on market data using evaluated pricing models and incorporating available trade, bid, and other market information. We evaluated the inputs used to value the instruments and validated the accuracy of the instrument fair values based on historical evidence. The investment in stock warrants and equity securities without readily determinable fair value of a privately-held company are classified as level 3 financial assets. The stock warrants are accounted for as a derivative instrument valued on a recurring basis considering the pricing of recent purchases or sales, if any, of the investment, as well as positive and negative qualitative evidence, while the equity securities without readily determinable fair value are accounted for as a cost-method investment which carries the securities at cost, except in the event of impairment. The contingent earn-out liability incurred in the acquisition of D'style is classified as a level 3 financial liability and is valued based on a valuation model that measures the present value of the probable cash payments based upon the forecasted operating performance of the D'style acquisition and a discount rate that captures the risk associated with the liability.\nSee Note 13 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending June 30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in Millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023-2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded Contractual Obligations: (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations (b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance\nSheet (c) (d) (e)\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecorded Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases (e)\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (f)\n</td> <td>54.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) As of June 30, 2019, we had no capital lease obligations. \n (b) Refer to Note 10 - Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding long-term debt obligations. Accrued interest is also included on the Long-Term Debt Obligations line. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes less than $0.1 million of long-term debt obligations due in fiscal year 2020, which were recorded as a current liability. \n (c) The timing of payments of certain items included on the Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet\u201d line above is estimated based on the following assumptions: \n \u2022 The timing of long-term SERP payments is estimated based on an assumed retirement age of 62 with payout based on the prior distribution elections of participants. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $3.1 million for SERP payments recorded as current liabilities. \n \u2022 The timing of severance plan payments is estimated based on the average remaining service life of employees. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $0.6 million for employee transition payments related to the transformation restructuring plan and $0.5 million for severance payments, which were both recorded as current liabilities. \n \u2022 The timing of warranty payments is estimated based on historical data. The fiscal year 2020 amount includes $0.8 million for short-term warranty payments recorded as a current liability. \n \u2022 The timing of the earn-out liability is contingent upon D'style's operating income for fiscal year 2019 compared to a predetermined target. The amount in the fiscal year 2020 column in the above table includes $0.4 million for earn-out payments recorded as a current liability. \n (d) Excludes $1.6 million of long-term unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties along with deferred tax liabilities and miscellaneous other long-term tax liabilities which are not tied to a contractual obligation and for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments. \n (e) Refer to Note 9 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding operating leases and certain other long-term liabilities. Executory costs such as property taxes and maintenance are excluded from the operating lease obligations. \n (f) Purchase Obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. The amounts listed above for purchase obligations include contractual commitments for items such as raw materials, supplies, capital expenditures, services, and software acquisitions/license commitments. Cancellable purchase obligations that we intend to fulfill are also included in the purchase obligations amount listed above through fiscal year 2024. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to standby letters of credit and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business. These arrangements do not have a material current effect and are not reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the standby letters of credit and operating leases. We do not have material exposures to trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.\nRevenue recognition - Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, we adopted guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, using a full retrospective method. Under the new guidance, revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring distinct goods or providing services to customers. Our revenue consists substantially of product sales, and is reported net of sales discounts, rebates, incentives, returns, and other allowances offered to customers. We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied, which occurs when control passes to a customer to enable them to direct the use of and obtain benefit from the product. This typically occurs when a customer obtains legal title, obtains the risks and rewards of ownership, has received the goods according to the contractual shipping terms either at the shipping point or destination, and is obligated to pay for the product. Shipping and handling activities are recognized as fulfillment activities and are expensed at the time revenue is recognized. We recognize sales net of applicable sales taxes and similar revenue-based taxes.\nWe use judgment in estimating the reduction in net sales driven by customer rebate and incentive programs. Judgments primarily include expected sales levels to be achieved and the corresponding rebate and incentive amounts expected to be earned by dealers and salespersons.\nWe also use judgment in estimating a reserve for returns and allowances which is recorded at the time of the sale, based on estimated product returns and price concessions. The reserve for returns and allowances is recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and impair receivable balances by recording specific allowances for bad debts based on judgment using factors such as current trends, the length of time the receivables are past due, and historical collection experience. The allowance for accounts receivable balances that are determined likely to be uncollectible are a reduction in the receivables line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the expense is recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSelf-insurance reserves - We are self-insured up to certain limits for automobile and general liability, workers' compensation, and certain employee health benefits such as medical, short-term disability, and dental, with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements. Our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors, including known claims, estimated incurred but not reported claims, and other analyses, which are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions for such matters as a result of increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly. At June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our accrued liabilities for self-insurance exposure were $3.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nTaxes - Deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change management's assessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax provision will be adjusted accordingly. The liability for uncertain income tax and other tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties on those positions, was $1.8 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.9 million at June 30, 2018.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and",
