General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a direct financing fund that primarily makes investments in domestic and international businesses, which investments are primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings (such as loans and leases) that are collateralized by Capital Assets utilized by such companies to operate their businesses, as well as other strategic investments in or collateralized by Capital Assets that our General Partner believes will provide us with a satisfactory, risk-adjusted rate of return. We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership and have elected to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As of the Initial Closing Date, we raised a minimum of $1,200,000 from the sale of our Interests, at which time we commenced operations. From the commencement of our offering on June 6, 2011 through the completion of our offering on June 6, 2013, we sold 197,597 Interests to 4,644 limited partners, representing $196,688,918 of capital contributions. Investors from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Tennessee were not admitted until we raised total equity in the amount of $20,000,000, which we achieved on November 17, 2011. Our operating period commenced on June 7, 2013.\nAfter the net offering proceeds were invested, additional investments have been and will continue to be made with the cash generated from our initial investments to the extent that cash is not used for our expenses, reserves and distributions to our partners. The investment in additional Capital Assets in this manner is called reinvestment.\u201d We anticipate investing and reinvesting in Capital Assets from time to time during our five year operating period, which may be extended, at our General Partner's discretion, for up to an additional three years. After the operating period, we will then sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business, during a time frame called the liquidation period.\u201d\nWe seek to generate returns in three ways. We seek to:\n\u00b7 generate current cash flow from payments of principal and/or interest (in the case of secured loans and other financing transactions) and rental payments (in the case of leases);\n\u00b7 generate deferred cash flow by realizing the value of certain Capital Assets or interests therein at the maturity of the investment; and\n\u00b7 generate a combination of both current and deferred cash flow from other structured investments.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Investment Manager believes the U.S. economy's recovery is likely to slow down in 2016, primarily due to a weakness in foreign growth and the strong dollar causing net exports to deteriorate and a reduction of domestic demand. The price decline of energy and other commodities has had a negative impact on the operating results of not only energy and mining companies but also other manufacturing companies with exposure to such end markets. As a result of these and other factors, we have recorded credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below). Our Investment Manager believes that these factors may continue to have an impact on the performance of some of our portfolio companies and related assets.\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nNotes Receivable\n\u00b7 On October 27, 2011, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $6,850,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $7,500,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature in July 2017. On June 22, 2012, we increased our loan facility with NTS by making an additional $1,540,000 secured term loan. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 60 months. On September 27, 2012, we made an additional secured term loan to NTS in the amount of $1,127,500. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 57 months. The loans were secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in equipment used in NTS's high speed broadband services operation, which provides internet access, digital cable television programming and local and long distance telephone service to residential and business customers. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the three loans by making a prepayment of $9,521,773, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $361,665. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On November 22, 2011, we made a secured term loan to Ensaimada in the amount of $5,298,947. The loan bears interest at 17% per year and matures in November 2016. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in a dry bulk carrier, its earnings and the equity interests of Ensaimada. All of Ensaimada's obligations under the loan agreement are guaranteed by both N&P Shipping Co. ( N&P\u201d), the parent company of Ensaimada, and by one of N&P's shareholders. As a result of (i) a depressed market for dry bulk carriers, (ii) interest payments that have historically been paid late by Ensaimada and (iii) ongoing discussions with Ensaimada regarding a prepayment plan for an amount that was expected to be less than the full principal balance of the loan, our Investment Manager assessed the collectability of the loan and determined to reserve the remaining principal balance of the loan that we did not expect to recover pursuant to such prepayment plan. Accordingly, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $794,842 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest income was recognized on a cash basis for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as we expected at the time to continue collecting interest on the loan until the earlier of the proposed prepayment and the maturity of the loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager was advised by Ensaimada that the company's plans for a refinancing transaction that would have enabled it to prepay the loan did not materialize. In addition, Ensaimada did not make its quarterly interest payment under the loan for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Based on discussions with Ensaimada at the time, our Investment Manager believed that it was likely that the loan would be extended and restructured. Accordingly, our Investment Manager concluded that there was doubt regarding Ensaimada's ability to repay the entire principal balance of the loan at maturity in November 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager performed an analysis to assess the collectability of the loan under various recovery scenarios, including with or without the extension and restructuring of the loan and the current fair market value of the collateral. Historical sale values of comparable dry bulk carriers and the current fair market value of the vessel were critical components of this analysis. Based on this analysis, an additional credit loss reserve of $946,879 was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Since the three months ended September 30, 2015, any payments received from Ensaimada would be applied to principal as there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. During December 2015, our Investment Manager met with Ensaimada to discuss a potential restructuring of the loan, but no agreement was reached. In addition, our Investment Manager considered (i) the upcoming maturity of the loan in November 2016, (ii) the lack of additional discussions with Ensaimada regarding a potential restructuring of the loan since December 2015 and (iii) the fact that the current fair market value of the collateral is less than Ensaimada's senior debt obligations, which has priority over our loan. Based upon these considerations, our Investment Manager determined to fully reserve the outstanding balance due under the loan as of December 31, 2015. The aggregate credit loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5,397,913. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $154,659 (of which $99,970 was recognized on a cash basis) and $756,499, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net investment in note receivable related to Ensaimada was $0 and $5,595,856, respectively.\n\u00b7 On February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets, which were valued at approximately $165,881,000 on the date the transaction occurred. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Investment Manager engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Investment Manager determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual\nstatus and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. As of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of the loan was $966,362. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Investment Manager making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,666 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,721 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,373 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,010 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 On July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $432,622, which included a prepayment fee of $44,620 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $1,875,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $311,500 as a charge against finance income.\n\u00b7 On September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $17,000,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d). The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,549,725, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $74,240. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $30,752.\n\u00b7 On March 1, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $7,200,000 to Heniff Transportation Systems, LLC and Heniff TTL, LLC (collectively, Heniff\u201d) as part of a $12,000,000 secured term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.25% per year and was for a period of 42 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in all of Heniff's assets, including tractors and stainless steel tank trailers, which were valued at approximately $44,810,000 on the date the transaction occurred. On December 30, 2014, Heniff made a partial prepayment in the aggregate amount of $3,929,355 on the loan, which included a prepayment fee and make whole interest of $185,355. As part of the transaction, the remaining balance of the loan was sold and assigned for $2,400,000. No significant gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 40% by us, 39% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC ( Fund Eleven\u201d) and 21% by ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC ( Fund Twelve\u201d), each an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased a portion of $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. The subordinated credit facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and matures in January 2021. The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was $12,296,208. As of March 31, 2015, JAC was in technical default of the facility as a result of its failure to provide certain financial data to the joint venture. In addition, JAC realized lower than expected operating results caused in part by a temporary shutdown of its manufacturing facility due to technical constraints that have since been resolved. As a result, JAC failed to make the expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Although this delayed payment did not trigger a payment default under the facility agreement, the interest rate payable by JAC under the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement did not commence and JAC's stakeholders were unable to agree upon a restructuring plan. As a result, the manufacturing facility had not yet resumed operations and JAC continued to experience liquidity constraints. Accordingly, our Investment Manager determined that there was doubt regarding the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility. Our Investment Manager visited JAC's facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon\nsuch discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the facility, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $7,200,000 to $25,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $17,342,915, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,161,658. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture placed the facility on non-accrual status and no finance income was recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, JAC continued to be non-operational and therefore not able to service interest payments under the facility. Discussions between the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. At September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager reassessed the collectability of the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Investment Manager also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the facility to equity and/or restructuring the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $21,800,000 to $27,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC prior to recording the initial credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $8,928,735, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,571,494. In January 2016, our Investment Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Investment Manager anticipates that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers will be implemented during the first half of 2016 to allow JAC's facility to recommence operations. Although our Investment Manager believes that the marketability of JAC's facility should improve if and when the facility recommences operations, our Investment Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint venture while operating under the expected tolling arrangement. Our Investment Manager updated the collectability analysis under the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Investment Manager considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint venture, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continues to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Investment Manager believes that the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility may result in less recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Investment Manager determined to record an additional credit loss of $5,365,776, which our Investment Manager believes is the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,146,310. An additional credit loss may be recorded in future periods based upon future developments of the receivership process or if the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility results in less of a recovery from its current estimate. Our Investment Manager has also assessed impairment under the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture and concluded that it is not impaired. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint venture recognized finance income of $1,152,580 and $4,003,314, respectively, prior to the facility being placed on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total net investment in note receivable held by the joint venture was $5,365,776 and $35,363,995, respectively, and our investment in the joint venture was $2,152,337 and $14,574,053, respectively.\n\u00b7 On October 4, 2013, we provided a $17,500,000 first drawdown on a secured term loan facility of up to $40,000,000 to Varada Ten Pte. Ltd. ( Varada\u201d). The facility was comprised of three loans, each to be used toward the purchase or refinancing of a respective vessel. The facility bore interest at 15% per year and was for a period of approximately 96 months, depending on the delivery and acceptance dates of two of the vessels and the drawdown date with respect to the third vessel. As a result of, among other things, Varada's failure to cause the completion of two additional vessels originally scheduled for delivery by September 30, 2014, the facility was only secured by a first priority security interest in and earnings from one vessel that was sub-chartered by Varada. In accordance with the facility agreement, as Varada's aggregate drawdown was less than $38,500,000 at September 30, 2014, we were entitled to a $2,100,000 undrawn commitment fee (the Undrawn Commitment Fee\u201d), which was recognized as additional finance income. As of December 31, 2014, we had an outstanding receivable of $18,497,860, of which $2,076,338 was over 90 days past due. Despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due, we had been accounting for the net investment in note receivable on an accrual basis as our Investment Manager believed that all contractual interest and principal payments and the Undrawn Commitment Fee were still collectible based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan net the related estimated costs to sell the collateral. As a result, we continued to recognize finance income on an accrual basis. On July 28, 2015, Varada satisfied its obligations in connection with the secured term loan\nfacility by making a prepayment of $18,524,638, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $100,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On October 29, 2013, we, together with a third-party creditor, made a superpriority, secured term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d) to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The Bridge Loan matured in 45 days, bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On November 26, 2013, our $7,500,000 portion of the Bridge Loan was rolled into a secured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) to Green Field. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature in 9 months, bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligation in connection with the Term Loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2014, we, Fund Twelve and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager (collectively ICON\u201d), entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $3,625,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $77,524 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to have all four platform supply vessels under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being capitalized. While our note receivable has not been paid in accordance with the loan agreement, our collateral position has been strengthened as the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. As a result, our Investment Manager is currently engaged in discussions with the senior lender and TMA to amend the TMA Facility and expects that payments to us will recommence in the near future. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and the collateral value as of December 31, 2015, our Investment Manager continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due.\n\u00b7 On September 24, 2014, we, Fund Twelve, Fund Fourteen and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $5,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bears interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and is for a period of six years. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. Premier Trailer's assets, including its fleet of trailers, were valued at approximately $64,088,000 (only a portion of which secures our loan) on the date the transaction occurred.\nOil field Services Equipment\n\u00b7 On February 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 58% by us, 38% by Fund Fourteen and 4% by ICON ECI Partners L.P. ( ECI Partners\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac, LLC ( Go Frac\u201d) for $11,803,985. Simultaneously, the equipment was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months, which was scheduled to expire on November 30, 2016. On July 19, 2013, the joint venture purchased additional onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac for $165,382, which was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months and was scheduled to expire on April 30, 2017. On December 30, 2013, the joint venture assigned the remaining 35 and 40 monthly rental payments totaling $7,028,793 due to the joint venture from Go Frac to Element Financial Corp. ( Element\u201d) in exchange for Element making a $6,464,372 non-recourse loan to the joint venture. The\nnon-recourse loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% and was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, declining energy prices negatively impacted Go Frac's financial performance resulting in its failure to satisfy its lease payment obligations in February 2015. In early February 2015, our Investment Manager was informed that Go Frac was ceasing its operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of $4,026,090 based on a third-party appraised fair market value of the leased equipment as of December 31, 2014. The fair market value provided by the independent appraiser was derived based on a combination of the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, our Investment Manager obtained quotes from multiple auctioneers and subsequently an auctioneer was engaged to sell the equipment at an auction. As of March 31, 2015, the equipment met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1,180,260 to write down the equipment to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, of $4,019,740. On May 14, 2015, the equipment was sold at an auction for $5,542,000, the majority of which was remitted directly to Element to satisfy our non-recourse long-term debt obligations of $4,292,780, consisting of unpaid principal and accrued interest. After deducting selling costs of $538,786, we recognized a gain on sale of assets of $983,474. In addition, as a result of Go Frac's default on the lease and our repossession and ultimate sale of the equipment, we recognized additional rental income of $2,638,850, primarily due to the extinguishment of our obligation to return a security deposit to Go Frac pursuant to the terms of the lease.\nMarine Vessels\n\u00b7 On April 2, 2013, two joint ventures each owned 55% by us and 45% by Fund Fourteen purchased two chemical tanker vessels, the Ardmore Capella and the Ardmore Calypso, from wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ardmore.

The Fugro Scout was delivered on December 23, 2015 and was simultaneously bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Fugro for a period of 12 years, although such charter can be terminated by the joint venture after year five. The Fugro Scout was acquired for (i) $8,250,000 in cash, (ii) $45,500,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from ABN AMRO Bank N.V. ( ABN AMRO\u201d), Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. ( Rabobank\u201d) and NIBC Bank N.V. ( NIBC\u201d) and (iii) an advanced charter hire payment of $11,250,000.

As of December 31, 2015, the cash portion of the purchase price for the Fugro Voyager of approximately $10,221,000 was being held by the applicable indirect subsidiary of the joint venture until delivery of the vessel and therefore, such cash was included in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAcquisition Fees\nIn connection with the transactions that we entered into during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred or paid acquisition fees to our Investment Manager of $2,853,563 and $2,502,515, respectively.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 8, 2016, a joint venture owned 75% by us acquired the Fugro Voyager for $8,250,000 in cash, $45,500,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from ABN AMRO, Rabobank and NIBC and an advanced charter hire payment of $11,250,000. Upon delivery on January 8, 2016, the Fugro Voyager was bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Fugro for a period of 12 years, although such charter can be terminated by the joint venture after year five. On February 8, 2016, the two indirect subsidiaries entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate of the senior secured loans related to the Fugro Scout and the Fugro Voyager from a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.95% per year to a fixed rate of 4.117% per year.\nOn January 15, 2016, D&T satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of $8,000,000.

This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted.

The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including\ninterim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which further specifies the SEC Staff's view on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 will be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU-2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption of both accounting standards updates, debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse long-term debt will be reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets from other assets to non-recourse long-term debt, while debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements will continue to be presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.

ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\n\u00b7 Lease classification and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Asset impairments;\n\u00b7 Depreciation;\n\u00b7 Notes receivable and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and\n\u00b7 Derivative financial instruments.\nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Investment Manager's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of operations. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Investment Manager monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Manager may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Investment Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Investment Manager does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Investment Manager then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Investment Manager's judgment, these accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables in non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Investment Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe may enter into derivative transactions for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We enter into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives may not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believe that these are effective economic hedges.\nWe recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria are met. These criteria demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and include an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria are met, which we must document and assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognize the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of all derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015\u201d) and 2014 ( 2014\u201d)\nThe following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods.

The loan was considered impaired during the three months ended December 31, 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional credit loss of $697,387 prior to the sale of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975 on July 23, 2015. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized in 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss was $197,010 for 2014 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net carrying value of our impaired loan related to Ensaimada was $0 and $5,595,856, respectively. We placed the loan on non-accrual status and a credit loss was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest income was recognized on a cash basis as we expected at the time to continue collecting interest on the loan until the earlier of a proposed prepayment and the maturity of the loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager was advised by Ensaimada that the company's plans for a refinancing transaction that would have enabled it to prepay the loan did not materialize. In addition, Ensaimada failed to make its quarterly interest payment under the loan for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. As a result, our Investment Manager concluded that there was doubt regarding Ensaimada's ability to repay the entire principal balance of the loan at maturity. Accordingly, an additional credit loss was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During December 2015, our Investment Manager met with Ensaimada to discuss a potential restructuring of the loan, but no agreement was reached. In addition, our Investment Manager considered (i) the upcoming maturity of the loan in November 2016, (ii) the lack of additional discussions with Ensaimada regarding a potential restructuring of the loan since December 2015 and (iii) the fact that the current fair market value of the collateral is less than Ensaimada's senior debt obligations, which has priority over our loan. Based upon these considerations, our Investment Manager determined to fully reserve the outstanding balance due under the loan as of December 31, 2015. The aggregate credit loss recorded during 2015 was $5,397,913. For 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $154,659 (of which $99,970 was recognized on a cash basis) and $756,499, respectively (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nOperating Lease Transactions\nThe following tables set forth the types of equipment subject to operating leases in our portfolio:\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Marine - container vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,254,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71,329,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Geotechnical drilling vessel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,216,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Photolithograph immersion scanner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,112,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,996,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,675,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183,584,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,201,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net carrying value of our operating lease transactions represents the balance of our leased equipment at cost as of each reporting date.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of Total Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Customer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Inotera Memories, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Photolithograph immersion scanner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Hoegh Autoliners Shipping AS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Marine - container vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Murray Energy Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mining equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Go Frac, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil field services equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpaired Assets within Operating Lease Transactions\nDuring 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of $4,026,090 on the leased equipment related to Go Frac. As of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of the leased equipment related to Go Frac was $5,200,000. Rental income of $2,446,608 was recognized with respect to the lease with Go Frac during 2014. As of March 31, 2015, the leased equipment was classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1,180,260 to write down the equipment to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, of $4,019,740. On May 14, 2015, the equipment was sold at an auction for $5,542,000 and a gain on sale of assets of $983,474 was recognized. During 2015, we recognized rental income of $2,849,632, of which $2,638,850 was primarily due to the extinguishment of our obligation to return a security deposit to Go Frac pursuant to the terms of the lease (see Significant Transactions\u201d above).\nRevenue and other income for 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Finance income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,568,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,762,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,193,167)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Rental income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,257,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,490,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,767,419\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Loss) income from investment in joint ventures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,289,362)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,287,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,577,108)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Gain on sale of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 983,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 983,474\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Other loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (241,478)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (162,685)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,793)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total revenue and other income\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,279,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,377,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,901,825\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue and other income for 2015 increased $5,901,825, or 15.8%, as compared to 2014 primarily attributable to an increase in rental income, which was primarily due to entering into a new operating lease with Inotera during December 2014, partially offset by a decrease in rental income due to the purchase of equipment by Murray in October 2015. The gain on sale of assets in 2015 related to the sale of equipment previously on lease to Go Frac with no comparable gain in 2014. These increases in total revenue and other income were partially offset by our share of the loss from investment in joint ventures related to JAC due to the credit loss recorded by the joint venture during 2015 (see Significant Transactions\u201d above), as well as a decrease in finance income due to several prepayments on our financing receivables during or subsequent to 2014 and placing the secured term loan to Ensaimada on non-accrual status during 2015.\nExpenses for 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,820,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,815,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,712\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Administrative expense reimbursements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,940,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,033,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92,365)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,977,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,038,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61,180)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,368,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,302,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,065,700\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,244,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,966,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,278,217\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,180,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,026,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,845,830)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Credit loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,095,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 634,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,460,594\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,627,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,817,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,809,848\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses for 2015 increased $22,809,848, or 79.2%, as compared to 2014. The increase in total expenses was primarily due to (i) an increase in depreciation expense on equipment acquired pursuant to the operating lease with Inotera that we entered into during December 2014, (ii) an aggregate credit loss of $5,397,913 recorded during 2015 related to Ensaimada and (iii) an increase in interest expense on our additional non-recourse long-term debt incurred for the purpose of acquiring the equipment on lease to Inotera. These increases were partially offset by a lower impairment loss recorded during 2015 as compared to 2014 in connection with the equipment previously on lease to Go Frac and a decrease in administrative expense reimbursements due to lower costs incurred on our behalf by our Investment Manager.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $2,320,592, from a net loss of $163,709 in 2014 to net income of $2,156,883 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to net income recognized in 2015 related to a gain on sale of assets on the equipment previously on lease to Go Frac and additional income recognized as a result of the extinguishment of our obligation to return the security deposit to Go Frac pursuant to the terms of the lease. The net loss recognized in 2014 was primarily due to the recognition of an impairment loss on the equipment previously on lease to Go Frac.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Fund Fifteen\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net (loss) income attributable to us for 2015 and 2014 was $(10,505,036) and $8,723,579, respectively. The net (loss) income attributable to us per weighted average Interest outstanding for 2015 and 2014 was $(52.69) and $43.73, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nThis section discusses the major balance sheet variances at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $7,077,847, from $320,646,657 at December 31, 2014 to $313,568,810 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in total assets was primarily the result of (i) depreciation on our leased equipment at cost, (ii) our share of the credit loss recorded by our joint venture related to JAC, (iii) the use of cash generated from our investments to repay our non-recourse long-term debt and pay distributions to our partners and noncontrolling interests and (iv) the credit loss recorded related to Ensaimada. The decrease was partially offset by operating income recognized on our investments during 2015 and the acquisition of the Fugro Scout that was partly financed through non-recourse long-term debt.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities increased $10,334,807, from $161,533,923 at December 31, 2014 to $171,868,730 at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to (i) additional non-recourse long-term debt of $45,500,000 incurred during 2015 related to the purchase of the Fugro Scout, (ii) an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to an advanced charter hire payment of $11,250,000 we received pursuant to the lease agreement with Fugro and (iii) an increase in acquisition fees due to our Investment Manager for two new investments we entered into during 2015. These increases were partially offset by scheduled repayments of our non-recourse long-term debt during 2015.\nEquity\nEquity decreased $17,412,654, from $159,112,734 at December 31, 2014 to $141,700,080 at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to distributions paid to our partners and noncontrolling interests and our net loss in 2015, partially offset by investments made by noncontrolling interests.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash of $18,067,904 and $20,340,317, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we have established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.50% of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of our Interests. As of December 31, 2015, the cash reserve was $983,445. During our offering period, our main source of cash was from financing activities and our main use of cash was in investing activities. During our operating period, our main source of cash is typically from operating activities and our main use of cash is in investing and financing activities. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we make new investments, pay distributions to our partners and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments.\nWe believe that cash generated from the expected results of our operations will be sufficient to finance our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including distributions to our partners, general and administrative expenses, new investment opportunities, management fees and administrative expense reimbursements.\nOur ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our borrowers' and lessees' businesses that are beyond our control.\nWe have used the net proceeds of the offering to invest in Capital Assets located in North America, Europe and other developed markets, including those in Asia and elsewhere. We have sought and continue to seek to acquire a portfolio of Capital Assets that is comprised of transactions that generate (a) current cash flow from payments of principal and/or interest (in the case of secured loans and other financing transactions) and rental payments (in the case of leases), (b) deferred cash flow by realizing the value of Capital Assets or interests therein at the maturity of the investment, or (c) a combination of both.\nUnanticipated or greater than anticipated operating costs or losses (including a borrower's inability to make timely loan payments or a lessee's inability to make timely lease payments) would adversely affect our liquidity. To the extent that working capital may be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we anticipate that we would fund our operations from cash flow generated by investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2015, we had $8,209,153 available to us under a revolving line of credit pursuant to the borrowing base to fund our short-term liquidity needs. For additional information, see Financings and Borrowings - Revolving Line of Credit, Recourse\u201d below and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Our General Partner does not intend to fund any cash flow deficit of ours or provide other financial assistance to us.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth summary cash flow data:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,926,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,801,708\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,201,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,775,918)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,400,384)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,982,787)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Net decrease in cash\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,272,413)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,956,997)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased $16,124,607, from $23,801,708 in 2014 to $39,926,315 in 2015. The increase primarily related to increases in rental payments received as a result of entering into the operating lease with Inotera during 2014 and the collection of certain receivables related to Varada that were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014, partially offset by the settlement of accrued liabilities during 2015 related to the purchase of equipment on lease to Inotera.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities increased $4,977,574, from a use of cash of $1,775,918 in 2014 to a source of cash of $3,201,656 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash used to invest in new notes receivable and joint ventures during 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as an increase in proceeds received due to the sale of certain equipment during 2015. The increase was partially offset by (i) an increase in cash used to acquire the assets on lease to Challenge and Fugro during 2015 as compared to the cash used to acquire the equipment on lease to Inotera during 2014, (ii) less principal received on notes receivable due to several prepayments during or subsequent to 2014 and (iii) restricted cash contributions pursuant to a provision in the non-recourse long-term debt agreement related to Fugro in 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities increased $19,417,597, from $25,982,787 in 2014 to $45,400,384 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt during 2015 primarily related to the purchase of equipment on lease to Inotera in 2014 and an increase in distributions paid to our noncontrolling interests during 2015. These increases were partially offset by an increase in contributions made by noncontrolling interests related to Challenge and Fugro.\nFinancings and Borrowings\nNon-Recourse Long-Term Debt\nWe had non-recourse long-term debt obligations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 of $149,701,639 and $146,012,447, respectively, related to certain vessels, the Lewek Ambassador, the Hoegh Copenhagen, the Ardmore Capella, the Ardmore Calypso and the Fugro Scout, and certain mining, oil field services and photolithograph scanning equipment. All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long term debt was $228,696,073 and $209,087,320, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our non-recourse long-term debt.\nRevolving Line of Credit, Recourse\nWe entered into an agreement with CB&T for a revolving line of credit through March 31, 2015 of up to $10,000,000 (the Facility\u201d), which is secured by all of our assets not subject to a first priority lien. On March 31, 2015, we extended the Facility through May 30, 2017 and the amount available under the Facility was increased to $12,500,000. As part of such amendment, we paid debt financing costs of $47,500. Amounts available under the Facility are subject to a borrowing base that is determined, subject to certain limitations, by the present value of the future receivables under certain loans and lease agreements in which we have a beneficial interest.\nThe interest rate for general advances under the Facility is CB&T's prime rate. We may elect to designate up to five advances on the outstanding principal balance of the Facility to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% per year. In all instances, borrowings under the Facility are subject to an interest rate floor of 4.0% per year. In addition, we are obligated to pay an annualized 0.5% fee on unused commitments under the Facility. At December 31, 2015, there were no obligations outstanding under the Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Facility.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $8,209,153 available under the Facility pursuant to the borrowing base.\nDistributions\nWe, at our General Partner's discretion, pay monthly distributions to our limited partners beginning with the first month after each such limited partner's admission and expect to continue to pay such distributions until the termination of our operating period. We paid distributions of $159,507 and $159,590 to our General Partner in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our limited partners in the amount of $15,791,266 and $15,799,439 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests in the amount of $2,014,802 and $1,296,007 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt the time we acquire or divest of an interest in Capital Assets, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our General Partner believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. We are a party to the Facility, as discussed in Financings and Borrowings - Revolving Line of Credit, Recourse\u201d above. We had no borrowings under the Facility at December 31, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had non-recourse and other debt obligations. Each lender has a security interest in the majority of the assets collateralizing each non-recourse debt instrument and an assignment of the rental payments under the lease associated with the assets. If the lessee defaults on the lease, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of the non-recourse debt. At December 31, 2015, our outstanding non-recourse long-term indebtedness and seller's credits totaled $163,138,726.\nPrincipal and interest maturities of our debt, related interest and seller's credits consisted of the following at December 31, 2015:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-recourse debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,701,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,029,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,796,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,875,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-recourse debt interest*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,386,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,121,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,806,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,458,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Seller's credits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,280,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,050,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190,538,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,191,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,683,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,613,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,050,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> * Based on fixed or variable rates in effect at December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash balances with certain banks. At December 31, 2015, we had restricted cash of $4,182,520, which is presented within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nNone.\nInflation and Interest Rates\nThe potential effects of inflation on us are difficult to predict. If the general economy experiences significant rates of inflation, however, it could affect us in a number of ways. We do not currently have or expect to have rent escalation clauses tied to inflation in our leases and most of our notes receivable contain fixed interest rates. The anticipated residual values to be realized upon the sale or re-lease of equipment upon lease termination (and thus the overall cash flow from our leases) may increase with inflation as the cost of similar new and used equipment increases.\nIf interest rates increase or decrease significantly, our leases and notes receivable already in place would generally not be affected.", "summary": "- On June 6, 2014, we completed our offering and had raised $1,207,500,000 of capital from the sale of our common stock and Interests in our Operating Company, of which $203,400,000 was from the sale of our common stock and $1,004,100,000 was from the sale of Interests in our Operating Company.\n- We invest primarily in secured loans and finance leases (collectively, \"financing receivables\").\n- Our financing receivables are secured by collateral and, accordingly, we bear relatively low credit risk because we have the right to seize and sell the collateral in the event of a default.\n- We may experience losses on our financing receivables in the event of a default and if such default occurs, we may not be able to recover the full amount owed to us, which may result in a loss.\n- We may also experience losses on our financing receivables due to declines in the value of the collateral securing the receivable and declines in the credit quality of the obligor.\n- We evaluate the credit quality of each of our financing receivables on a regular basis.", "item_7_tables": "", "item_7_text": "Item 7. General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a direct financing fund that primarily makes investments in domestic and international businesses, which investments are primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings (such as loans and leases) that are collateralized by Capital Assets utilized by such companies to operate their businesses, as well as other strategic investments in or collateralized by Capital Assets that our General Partner believes will provide us with a satisfactory, risk-adjusted rate of return. We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership and have elected to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As of the Initial Closing Date, we raised a minimum of $1,200,000 from the sale of our Interests, at which time we commenced operations. From the commencement of our offering on June 6, 2011 through the completion of our offering on June 6, 2013, we sold 197,597 Interests to 4,644 limited partners, representing $196,688,918 of capital contributions. Investors from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Tennessee were not admitted until we raised total equity in the amount of $20,000,000, which we achieved on November 17, 2011. Our operating period commenced on June 7, 2013.\nAfter the net offering proceeds were invested, additional investments have been and will continue to be made with the cash generated from our initial investments to the extent that cash is not used for our expenses, reserves and distributions to our partners. The investment in additional Capital Assets in this manner is called reinvestment.\u201d We anticipate investing and reinvesting in Capital Assets from time to time during our five year operating period, which may be extended, at our General Partner's discretion, for up to an additional three years. After the operating period, we will then sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business, during a time frame called the liquidation period.\u201d\nWe seek to generate returns in three ways. We seek to:\n\u00b7 generate current cash flow from payments of principal and/or interest (in the case of secured loans and other financing transactions) and rental payments (in the case of leases);\n\u00b7 generate deferred cash flow by realizing the value of certain Capital Assets or interests therein at the maturity of the investment; and\n\u00b7 generate a combination of both current and deferred cash flow from other structured investments.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Investment Manager believes the U.S. economy's recovery is likely to slow down in 2016, primarily due to a weakness in foreign growth and the strong dollar causing net exports to deteriorate and a reduction of domestic demand. The price decline of energy and other commodities has had a negative impact on the operating results of not only energy and mining companies but also other manufacturing companies with exposure to such end markets. As a result of these and other factors, we have recorded credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below). Our Investment Manager believes that these factors may continue to have an impact on the performance of some of our portfolio companies and related assets.\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nNotes Receivable\n\u00b7 On October 27, 2011, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $6,850,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $7,500,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature in July 2017. On June 22, 2012, we increased our loan facility with NTS by making an additional $1,540,000 secured term loan. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 60 months. On September 27, 2012, we made an additional secured term loan to NTS in the amount of $1,127,500. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 57 months. The loans were secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in equipment used in NTS's high speed broadband services operation, which provides internet access, digital cable television programming and local and long distance telephone service to residential and business customers. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the three loans by making a prepayment of $9,521,773, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $361,665. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On November 22, 2011, we made a secured term loan to Ensaimada in the amount of $5,298,947. The loan bears interest at 17% per year and matures in November 2016. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in a dry bulk carrier, its earnings and the equity interests of Ensaimada. All of Ensaimada's obligations under the loan agreement are guaranteed by both N&P Shipping Co. ( N&P\u201d), the parent company of Ensaimada, and by one of N&P's shareholders. As a result of (i) a depressed market for dry bulk carriers, (ii) interest payments that have historically been paid late by Ensaimada and (iii) ongoing discussions with Ensaimada regarding a prepayment plan for an amount that was expected to be less than the full principal balance of the loan, our Investment Manager assessed the collectability of the loan and determined to reserve the remaining principal balance of the loan that we did not expect to recover pursuant to such prepayment plan. Accordingly, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $794,842 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest income was recognized on a cash basis for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as we expected at the time to continue collecting interest on the loan until the earlier of the proposed prepayment and the maturity of the loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager was advised by Ensaimada that the company's plans for a refinancing transaction that would have enabled it to prepay the loan did not materialize. In addition, Ensaimada did not make its quarterly interest payment under the loan for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Based on discussions with Ensaimada at the time, our Investment Manager believed that it was likely that the loan would be extended and restructured. Accordingly, our Investment Manager concluded that there was doubt regarding Ensaimada's ability to repay the entire principal balance of the loan at maturity in November 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager performed an analysis to assess the collectability of the loan under various recovery scenarios, including with or without the extension and restructuring of the loan and the current fair market value of the collateral. Historical sale values of comparable dry bulk carriers and the current fair market value of the vessel were critical components of this analysis. Based on this analysis, an additional credit loss reserve of $946,879 was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Since the three months ended September 30, 2015, any payments received from Ensaimada would be applied to principal as there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. During December 2015, our Investment Manager met with Ensaimada to discuss a potential restructuring of the loan, but no agreement was reached. In addition, our Investment Manager considered (i) the upcoming maturity of the loan in November 2016, (ii) the lack of additional discussions with Ensaimada regarding a potential restructuring of the loan since December 2015 and (iii) the fact that the current fair market value of the collateral is less than Ensaimada's senior debt obligations, which has priority over our loan. Based upon these considerations, our Investment Manager determined to fully reserve the outstanding balance due under the loan as of December 31, 2015. The aggregate credit loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5,397,913. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $154,659 (of which $99,970 was recognized on a cash basis) and $756,499, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net investment in note receivable related to Ensaimada was $0 and $5,595,856, respectively.\n\u00b7 On February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets, which were valued at approximately $165,881,000 on the date the transaction occurred. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Investment Manager engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Investment Manager determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual\nstatus and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. As of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of the loan was $966,362. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Investment Manager making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,666 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,721 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,373 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,010 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 On July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $432,622, which included a prepayment fee of $44,620 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $1,875,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $311,500 as a charge against finance income.\n\u00b7 On September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $17,000,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d). The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,549,725, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $74,240. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $30,752.\n\u00b7 On March 1, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $7,200,000 to Heniff Transportation Systems, LLC and Heniff TTL, LLC (collectively, Heniff\u201d) as part of a $12,000,000 secured term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.25% per year and was for a period of 42 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in all of Heniff's assets, including tractors and stainless steel tank trailers, which were valued at approximately $44,810,000 on the date the transaction occurred. On December 30, 2014, Heniff made a partial prepayment in the aggregate amount of $3,929,355 on the loan, which included a prepayment fee and make whole interest of $185,355. As part of the transaction, the remaining balance of the loan was sold and assigned for $2,400,000. No significant gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 40% by us, 39% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC ( Fund Eleven\u201d) and 21% by ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC ( Fund Twelve\u201d), each an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased a portion of $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. The subordinated credit facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and matures in January 2021. The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was $12,296,208. As of March 31, 2015, JAC was in technical default of the facility as a result of its failure to provide certain financial data to the joint venture. In addition, JAC realized lower than expected operating results caused in part by a temporary shutdown of its manufacturing facility due to technical constraints that have since been resolved. As a result, JAC failed to make the expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Although this delayed payment did not trigger a payment default under the facility agreement, the interest rate payable by JAC under the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement did not commence and JAC's stakeholders were unable to agree upon a restructuring plan. As a result, the manufacturing facility had not yet resumed operations and JAC continued to experience liquidity constraints. Accordingly, our Investment Manager determined that there was doubt regarding the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility. Our Investment Manager visited JAC's facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon\nsuch discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the facility, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $7,200,000 to $25,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $17,342,915, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,161,658. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture placed the facility on non-accrual status and no finance income was recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, JAC continued to be non-operational and therefore not able to service interest payments under the facility. Discussions between the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. At September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager reassessed the collectability of the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Investment Manager also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the facility to equity and/or restructuring the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $21,800,000 to $27,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC prior to recording the initial credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $8,928,735, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,571,494. In January 2016, our Investment Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Investment Manager anticipates that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers will be implemented during the first half of 2016 to allow JAC's facility to recommence operations. Although our Investment Manager believes that the marketability of JAC's facility should improve if and when the facility recommences operations, our Investment Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint venture while operating under the expected tolling arrangement. Our Investment Manager updated the collectability analysis under the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Investment Manager considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint venture, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continues to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Investment Manager believes that the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility may result in less recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Investment Manager determined to record an additional credit loss of $5,365,776, which our Investment Manager believes is the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,146,310. An additional credit loss may be recorded in future periods based upon future developments of the receivership process or if the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility results in less of a recovery from its current estimate. Our Investment Manager has also assessed impairment under the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture and concluded that it is not impaired. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint venture recognized finance income of $1,152,580 and $4,003,314, respectively, prior to the facility being placed on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total net investment in note receivable held by the joint venture was $5,365,776 and $35,363,995, respectively, and our investment in the joint venture was $2,152,337 and $14,574,053, respectively.\n\u00b7 On October 4, 2013, we provided a $17,500,000 first drawdown on a secured term loan facility of up to $40,000,000 to Varada Ten Pte. Ltd. ( Varada\u201d). The facility was comprised of three loans, each to be used toward the purchase or refinancing of a respective vessel. The facility bore interest at 15% per year and was for a period of approximately 96 months, depending on the delivery and acceptance dates of two of the vessels and the drawdown date with respect to the third vessel. As a result of, among other things, Varada's failure to cause the completion of two additional vessels originally scheduled for delivery by September 30, 2014, the facility was only secured by a first priority security interest in and earnings from one vessel that was sub-chartered by Varada. In accordance with the facility agreement, as Varada's aggregate drawdown was less than $38,500,000 at September 30, 2014, we were entitled to a $2,100,000 undrawn commitment fee (the Undrawn Commitment Fee\u201d), which was recognized as additional finance income. As of December 31, 2014, we had an outstanding receivable of $18,497,860, of which $2,076,338 was over 90 days past due. Despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due, we had been accounting for the net investment in note receivable on an accrual basis as our Investment Manager believed that all contractual interest and principal payments and the Undrawn Commitment Fee were still collectible based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan net the related estimated costs to sell the collateral. As a result, we continued to recognize finance income on an accrual basis. On July 28, 2015, Varada satisfied its obligations in connection with the secured term loan\nfacility by making a prepayment of $18,524,638, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $100,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On October 29, 2013, we, together with a third-party creditor, made a superpriority, secured term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d) to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The Bridge Loan matured in 45 days, bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On November 26, 2013, our $7,500,000 portion of the Bridge Loan was rolled into a secured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) to Green Field. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature in 9 months, bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligation in connection with the Term Loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2014, we, Fund Twelve and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager (collectively ICON\u201d), entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $3,625,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $77,524 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to have all four platform supply vessels under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being capitalized. While our note receivable has not been paid in accordance with the loan agreement, our collateral position has been strengthened as the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. As a result, our Investment Manager is currently engaged in discussions with the senior lender and TMA to amend the TMA Facility and expects that payments to us will recommence in the near future. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and the collateral value as of December 31, 2015, our Investment Manager continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due.\n\u00b7 On September 24, 2014, we, Fund Twelve, Fund Fourteen and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $5,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bears interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and is for a period of six years. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. Premier Trailer's assets, including its fleet of trailers, were valued at approximately $64,088,000 (only a portion of which secures our loan) on the date the transaction occurred.\nOil field Services Equipment\n\u00b7 On February 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 58% by us, 38% by Fund Fourteen and 4% by ICON ECI Partners L.P. ( ECI Partners\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac, LLC ( Go Frac\u201d) for $11,803,985. Simultaneously, the equipment was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months, which was scheduled to expire on November 30, 2016. On July 19, 2013, the joint venture purchased additional onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac for $165,382, which was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months and was scheduled to expire on April 30, 2017. On December 30, 2013, the joint venture assigned the remaining 35 and 40 monthly rental payments totaling $7,028,793 due to the joint venture from Go Frac to Element Financial Corp. ( Element\u201d) in exchange for Element making a $6,464,372 non-recourse loan to the joint venture. The\nnon-recourse loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% and was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, declining energy prices negatively impacted Go Frac's financial performance resulting in its failure to satisfy its lease payment obligations in February 2015. In early February 2015, our Investment Manager was informed that Go Frac was ceasing its operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of $4,026,090 based on a third-party appraised fair market value of the leased equipment as of December 31, 2014. The fair market value provided by the independent appraiser was derived based on a combination of the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, our Investment Manager obtained quotes from multiple auctioneers and subsequently an auctioneer was engaged to sell the equipment at an auction. As of March 31, 2015, the equipment met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1,180,260 to write down the equipment to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, of $4,019,740. On May 14, 2015, the equipment was sold at an auction for $5,542,000, the majority of which was remitted directly to Element to satisfy our non-recourse long-term debt obligations of $4,292,780, consisting of unpaid principal and accrued interest. After deducting selling costs of $538,786, we recognized a gain on sale of assets of $983,474. In addition, as a result of Go Frac's default on the lease and our repossession and ultimate sale of the equipment, we recognized additional rental income of $2,638,850, primarily due to the extinguishment of our obligation to return a security deposit to Go Frac pursuant to the terms of the lease.\nMarine Vessels\n\u00b7 On April 2, 2013, two joint ventures each owned 55% by us and 45% by Fund Fourteen purchased two chemical tanker vessels, the Ardmore Capella and the Ardmore Calypso, from wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ardmore. Simultaneously, the vessels were bareboat chartered to the Ardmore subsidiaries for a period of five years. The aggregate purchase price for the vessels was funded by $8,850,000 in cash, $22,750,000 of financing through non-recourse long-term debt and $5,500,000 of financing through subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credits. In December 2015, we were notified by Ardmore that it will be exercising its options to purchase the Ardmore Capella and the Ardmore Calypso in or around April 2016.\n\u00b7 On March 21, 2014, a joint venture owned 12.5% by us, 75% by Fund Twelve and 12.5% by Fund Fourteen, through two indirect subsidiaries, entered into memoranda of agreement to purchase the SIVA Vessels from Siva Global for an aggregate purchase price of $41,600,000. The EPIC Bali and the EPIC Borneo were delivered on March 28, 2014 and April 8, 2014, respectively. The SIVA Vessels were bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Siva Global for a period of eight years upon the delivery of each respective vessel. The SIVA Vessels were each acquired for approximately $3,550,000 in cash, $12,400,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd. ( DVB\u201d) and $4,750,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit. Our contribution to the joint venture was $1,022,225.\n\u00b7 On June 12, 2014, a joint venture owned 12.5% by us, 75% by Fund Twelve and 12.5% by Fund Fourteen purchased an offshore supply vessel from Pacific Crest for $40,000,000.

The vessel was acquired for approximately $12,000,000 in cash, $26,000,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB and $2,000,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit. Our contribution to the joint venture was $1,617,158.\nMining Equipment\n\u00b7 On June 29, 2012, a joint venture owned 94.2% by us and 5.8% by ECI Partners purchased certain mining equipment for $8,581,573 that was subject to lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Murray\u201d). The lease was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015, but was extended for one month with an additional lease payment of $229,909. On October 29, 2015, Murray purchased the equipment for $2,038,124. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale.\n\u00b7 On August 3, 2012, a joint venture owned 96% by us and 4% by ECI Partners purchased certain mining equipment for $10,518,850 that was subject to lease with Murray, which expired on October 31, 2015. On September 9, 2013, the joint venture assigned the remaining 25 monthly rental payments totaling $6,812,019 due to the joint venture from Murray to People's Capital and Leasing Corp. ( People's Capital\u201d) in exchange for People's Capital making a $6,413,574 non-recourse loan to the joint venture. The loan was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2015 and bore interest at 5.75% per year. Upon expiration of the lease, Murray purchased the equipment for $2,415,519. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale. The joint venture used a portion of the sale proceeds to satisfy its obligations with People's Capital in full by making a repayment of $272,481.\n\u00b7 On March 4, 2014, a joint venture owned 15% by us, 60% by Fund Twelve, 15% by Fund Fourteen and 10% by Fund Sixteen purchased mining equipment from an affiliate of Blackhawk. Simultaneously, the mining equipment was leased to Blackhawk and its affiliates for four years. The aggregate purchase price for the mining equipment of $25,359,446 was funded by $17,859,446 in cash and $7,500,000 of non-recourse long-term debt. Our contribution to the joint venture was $2,693,395. On October 27, 2015, the joint venture amended the lease with Blackhawk to waive Blackhawk's breach of a financial covenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in consideration for a partial prepayment of $3,502,514, which included an amendment fee of $75,000. In addition, corresponding amendments were made to certain payment and repurchase provisions of the lease to account for the partial prepayment.

The joint venture received an additional amendment fee of $75,000.\nTelecommunications Equipment\n\u00b7 On June 9, 2011, a joint venture owned by us and Fund Fourteen purchased $6,358,763 of telecommunications equipment and simultaneously leased the equipment to Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. ( Global Crossing\u201d). The base term of the lease schedule was for a period of 36 months, commencing on July 1, 2011. On August 11, 2011, we contributed $1,835,843 of capital to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees. Subsequent to our capital contribution, the joint venture was owned 29.2% by us and 70.8% by Fund Fourteen. On October 20, 2011, we exchanged our 29.2% ownership interest in the joint venture for our proportionate share of the lease schedules that were previously owned by the joint venture. Upon completion of the exchange, the joint venture was terminated. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction. On May 30, 2014, Global Crossing exercised its option to purchase the telecommunications equipment prior to lease expiration at the purchase option price of $328,192.

The Fugro Scout was delivered on December 23, 2015 and was simultaneously bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Fugro for a period of 12 years, although such charter can be terminated by the joint venture after year five. The Fugro Scout was acquired for (i) $8,250,000 in cash, (ii) $45,500,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including\ninterim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which further specifies the SEC Staff's view on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 will be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU-2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption of both accounting standards updates, debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse long-term debt will be reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets from other assets to non-recourse long-term debt, while debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements will continue to be presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07\u201d), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\n\u00b7 Lease classification and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Asset impairments;\n\u00b7 Depreciation;\n\u00b7 Notes receivable and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and\n\u00b7 Derivative financial instruments.\nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Investment Manager's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of operations. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Investment Manager monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Manager may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Investment Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Investment Manager does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Investment Manager then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Investment Manager's judgment, these accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables in non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Investment Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe may enter into derivative transactions for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We enter into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives may not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believe that these are effective economic hedges.\nWe recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria are met. These criteria demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and include an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria are met, which we must document and assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognize the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of equity on", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur General Partner's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements made in this section may be considered forward-looking. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions, including, among other things, factors discussed in Part I. Forward-Looking Statements\u201d located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a direct financing fund that primarily makes investments in domestic and international businesses, which investments are primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings (such as loans and leases) that are collateralized by Capital Assets utilized by such companies to operate their businesses, as well as other strategic investments in or collateralized by Capital Assets that our General Partner believes will provide us with a satisfactory, risk-adjusted rate of return. We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership and have elected to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As of the Initial Closing Date, we raised a minimum of $1,200,000 from the sale of our Interests, at which time we commenced operations. From the commencement of our offering on June 6, 2011 through the completion of our offering on June 6, 2013, we sold 197,597 Interests to 4,644 limited partners, representing $196,688,918 of capital contributions. Investors from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Tennessee were not admitted until we raised total equity in the amount of $20,000,000, which we achieved on November 17, 2011. Our operating period commenced on June 7, 2013.\nAfter the net offering proceeds were invested, additional investments have been and will continue to be made with the cash generated from our initial investments to the extent that cash is not used for our expenses, reserves and distributions to our partners. The investment in additional Capital Assets in this manner is called reinvestment.\u201d We anticipate investing and reinvesting in Capital Assets from time to time during our five year operating period, which may be extended, at our General Partner's discretion, for up to an additional three years. After the operating period, we will then sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business, during a time frame called the liquidation period.\u201d\nWe seek to generate returns in three ways. We seek to:\n\u00b7 generate current cash flow from payments of principal and/or interest (in the case of secured loans and other financing transactions) and rental payments (in the case of leases);\n\u00b7 generate deferred cash flow by realizing the value of certain Capital Assets or interests therein at the maturity of the investment; and\n\u00b7 generate a combination of both current and deferred cash flow from other structured investments.\nCurrent Business Environment\nRecent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment, which are typically impacted by general economic conditions. As the economy slows or builds momentum, the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases, depending on a number of factors. These factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing and/or provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers, lessees, and other counterparties, as well as the desire to upgrade equipment and/or expand operations during times of growth, but also in times of recession in order to, among other things, seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors and/or increase business as the economy recovers.\nOur Investment Manager believes the U.S. economy's recovery is likely to slow down in 2016, primarily due to a weakness in foreign growth and the strong dollar causing net exports to deteriorate and a reduction of domestic demand. The price decline of energy and other commodities has had a negative impact on the operating results of not only energy and mining companies but also other manufacturing companies with exposure to such end markets. As a result of these and other factors, we have recorded credit losses and/or impairment charges on certain of our investments (see Significant Transactions\u201d below). Our Investment Manager believes that these factors may continue to have an impact on the performance of some of our portfolio companies and related assets.\nSignificant Transactions\nWe engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nNotes Receivable\n\u00b7 On October 27, 2011, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $6,850,000 to NTS Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, NTS\u201d) as part of a $7,500,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was scheduled to mature in July 2017. On June 22, 2012, we increased our loan facility with NTS by making an additional $1,540,000 secured term loan. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 60 months. On September 27, 2012, we made an additional secured term loan to NTS in the amount of $1,127,500. The loan bore interest at 12.75% per year and was for a period of 57 months. The loans were secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in equipment used in NTS's high speed broadband services operation, which provides internet access, digital cable television programming and local and long distance telephone service to residential and business customers. On June 6, 2014, NTS satisfied their obligations in connection with the three loans by making a prepayment of $9,521,773, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $361,665. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On November 22, 2011, we made a secured term loan to Ensaimada in the amount of $5,298,947. The loan bears interest at 17% per year and matures in November 2016. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in a dry bulk carrier, its earnings and the equity interests of Ensaimada. All of Ensaimada's obligations under the loan agreement are guaranteed by both N&P Shipping Co. ( N&P\u201d), the parent company of Ensaimada, and by one of N&P's shareholders. As a result of (i) a depressed market for dry bulk carriers, (ii) interest payments that have historically been paid late by Ensaimada and (iii) ongoing discussions with Ensaimada regarding a prepayment plan for an amount that was expected to be less than the full principal balance of the loan, our Investment Manager assessed the collectability of the loan and determined to reserve the remaining principal balance of the loan that we did not expect to recover pursuant to such prepayment plan. Accordingly, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss reserve of $794,842 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest income was recognized on a cash basis for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as we expected at the time to continue collecting interest on the loan until the earlier of the proposed prepayment and the maturity of the loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager was advised by Ensaimada that the company's plans for a refinancing transaction that would have enabled it to prepay the loan did not materialize. In addition, Ensaimada did not make its quarterly interest payment under the loan for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Based on discussions with Ensaimada at the time, our Investment Manager believed that it was likely that the loan would be extended and restructured. Accordingly, our Investment Manager concluded that there was doubt regarding Ensaimada's ability to repay the entire principal balance of the loan at maturity in November 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager performed an analysis to assess the collectability of the loan under various recovery scenarios, including with or without the extension and restructuring of the loan and the current fair market value of the collateral. Historical sale values of comparable dry bulk carriers and the current fair market value of the vessel were critical components of this analysis. Based on this analysis, an additional credit loss reserve of $946,879 was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Since the three months ended September 30, 2015, any payments received from Ensaimada would be applied to principal as there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. During December 2015, our Investment Manager met with Ensaimada to discuss a potential restructuring of the loan, but no agreement was reached. In addition, our Investment Manager considered (i) the upcoming maturity of the loan in November 2016, (ii) the lack of additional discussions with Ensaimada regarding a potential restructuring of the loan since December 2015 and (iii) the fact that the current fair market value of the collateral is less than Ensaimada's senior debt obligations, which has priority over our loan. Based upon these considerations, our Investment Manager determined to fully reserve the outstanding balance due under the loan as of December 31, 2015. The aggregate credit loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5,397,913. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized finance income of $154,659 (of which $99,970 was recognized on a cash basis) and $756,499, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the net investment in note receivable related to Ensaimada was $0 and $5,595,856, respectively.\n\u00b7 On February 29, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,000,000 to VAS Aero Services, LLC ( VAS\u201d) as part of a $42,755,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at variable rates ranging between 12% and 14.5% per year and matured on October 6, 2014. The loan was secured by a second priority security interest in all of VAS's assets, which were valued at approximately $165,881,000 on the date the transaction occurred. During the year ended December 31, 2014, VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the loan as well as the balloon payment due on the maturity date. Our Investment Manager engaged in discussions with VAS, VAS's owners, the senior creditor and other second lien creditors in order to put in place a viable restructuring or refinancing plan. In December 2014, this specific plan to restructure or refinance fell through. While discussions on other options were still ongoing, our Investment Manager determined that we should record a credit loss reserve based on an estimated liquidation value of VAS's inventory and accounts receivable. As a result, the loan was placed on non-accrual\nstatus and a credit loss reserve of $631,986 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 based on our pro-rata share of the liquidation value of the collateral. The value of the collateral was based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. As of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of the loan was $966,362. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Investment Manager making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,666 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB Loan, LLC ( GB\u201d) for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,721 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 prior to the sale. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. In addition, we wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of $1,329,373 during the year ended December 31, 2015. No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired. Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015. Finance income recognized on the loan prior to recording the credit loss reserve was $197,010 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\u00b7 On July 24, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $2,500,000 to affiliates of Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. (collectively, Frontier\u201d) as part of a $5,000,000 term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 14% per year and was for a period of 66 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Frontier's saltwater disposal wells and related equipment and a second priority security interest in Frontier's other assets, including real estate, machinery and accounts receivable. On October 11, 2013, Frontier made a partial prepayment of $432,622, which included a prepayment fee of $44,620 that was recognized as additional finance income. On December 30, 2014, we sold all of our interest in the loan to Frontier Expansion and Development, LLC for $1,875,000. As a result, we recognized a loss and wrote off the remaining initial direct costs associated with the notes receivable totaling $311,500 as a charge against finance income.\n\u00b7 On September 10, 2012, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $17,000,000 to Superior Tube Company, Inc. and Tubes Holdco Limited (collectively, Superior\u201d). The loan bore interest at 12% per year and was for a period of 60 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in Superior's assets, including tube manufacturing and related equipment and a mortgage on real property, and a second priority security interest in Superior's accounts receivable and inventory. On January 30, 2015, Superior satisfied its obligations in connection with the loan by making a prepayment of $2,549,725, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $74,240. As a result, we recognized additional finance income of $30,752.\n\u00b7 On March 1, 2013, we made a secured term loan in the amount of $7,200,000 to Heniff Transportation Systems, LLC and Heniff TTL, LLC (collectively, Heniff\u201d) as part of a $12,000,000 secured term loan facility. The loan bore interest at 12.25% per year and was for a period of 42 months. The loan was secured by, among other things, a second priority security interest in all of Heniff's assets, including tractors and stainless steel tank trailers, which were valued at approximately $44,810,000 on the date the transaction occurred. On December 30, 2014, Heniff made a partial prepayment in the aggregate amount of $3,929,355 on the loan, which included a prepayment fee and make whole interest of $185,355. As part of the transaction, the remaining balance of the loan was sold and assigned for $2,400,000. No significant gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 40% by us, 39% by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC ( Fund Eleven\u201d) and 21% by ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC ( Fund Twelve\u201d), each an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased a portion of $208,038,290 subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered for $28,462,500. The subordinated credit facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between 12.5% and 15% per year and matures in January 2021. The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC's assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was $12,296,208. As of March 31, 2015, JAC was in technical default of the facility as a result of its failure to provide certain financial data to the joint venture. In addition, JAC realized lower than expected operating results caused in part by a temporary shutdown of its manufacturing facility due to technical constraints that have since been resolved. As a result, JAC failed to make the expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Although this delayed payment did not trigger a payment default under the facility agreement, the interest rate payable by JAC under the facility increased from 12.5% to 15.5%. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an expected tolling arrangement did not commence and JAC's stakeholders were unable to agree upon a restructuring plan. As a result, the manufacturing facility had not yet resumed operations and JAC continued to experience liquidity constraints. Accordingly, our Investment Manager determined that there was doubt regarding the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility. Our Investment Manager visited JAC's facility and engaged in discussions with JAC's other stakeholders to agree upon a restructuring plan. Based upon\nsuch discussions, which included a potential conversion of a portion of the facility to equity and/or a restructuring of the facility, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $7,200,000 to $25,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC as of June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $17,342,915, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome based upon the negotiations at the time. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $7,161,658. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint venture placed the facility on non-accrual status and no finance income was recognized. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, JAC continued to be non-operational and therefore not able to service interest payments under the facility. Discussions between the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. At September 30, 2015, our Investment Manager reassessed the collectability of the facility by considering the following factors: (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. Our Investment Manager also considered the proposed plan of converting a portion of the facility to equity and/or restructuring the facility in the event that JAC's stakeholders recommenced discussions. Based upon such reassessment, our Investment Manager believed that the joint venture may potentially not be able to recover approximately $21,800,000 to $27,000,000 of the outstanding balance due from JAC prior to recording the initial credit loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the joint venture recognized a credit loss of $8,928,735, which our Investment Manager believed was the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,571,494. In January 2016, our Investment Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC's other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC's manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Investment Manager anticipates that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers will be implemented during the first half of 2016 to allow JAC's facility to recommence operations. Although our Investment Manager believes that the marketability of JAC's facility should improve if and when the facility recommences operations, our Investment Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint venture while operating under the expected tolling arrangement. Our Investment Manager updated the collectability analysis under the facility as of December 31, 2015 and determined that comparable enterprise values derived from EBITDA multiples and trading prices of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries each decreased. In addition, our Investment Manager considered that, as of December 31, 2015, (i) a tolling arrangement with JAC's suppliers did not commence as originally anticipated; (ii) no further discussions occurred between JAC, the joint venture, the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan and (iii) JAC's manufacturing facility continues to be non-operational. Based upon these factors, our Investment Manager believes that the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility may result in less recovery from its prior estimate. As a result, our Investment Manager determined to record an additional credit loss of $5,365,776, which our Investment Manager believes is the most likely outcome derived from its reassessment as of December 31, 2015. Our share of the credit loss for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2,146,310. An additional credit loss may be recorded in future periods based upon future developments of the receivership process or if the joint venture's ultimate collectability of the facility results in less of a recovery from its current estimate. Our Investment Manager has also assessed impairment under the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture and concluded that it is not impaired. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the joint venture recognized finance income of $1,152,580 and $4,003,314, respectively, prior to the facility being placed on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total net investment in note receivable held by the joint venture was $5,365,776 and $35,363,995, respectively, and our investment in the joint venture was $2,152,337 and $14,574,053, respectively.\n\u00b7 On October 4, 2013, we provided a $17,500,000 first drawdown on a secured term loan facility of up to $40,000,000 to Varada Ten Pte. Ltd. ( Varada\u201d). The facility was comprised of three loans, each to be used toward the purchase or refinancing of a respective vessel. The facility bore interest at 15% per year and was for a period of approximately 96 months, depending on the delivery and acceptance dates of two of the vessels and the drawdown date with respect to the third vessel. As a result of, among other things, Varada's failure to cause the completion of two additional vessels originally scheduled for delivery by September 30, 2014, the facility was only secured by a first priority security interest in and earnings from one vessel that was sub-chartered by Varada. In accordance with the facility agreement, as Varada's aggregate drawdown was less than $38,500,000 at September 30, 2014, we were entitled to a $2,100,000 undrawn commitment fee (the Undrawn Commitment Fee\u201d), which was recognized as additional finance income. As of December 31, 2014, we had an outstanding receivable of $18,497,860, of which $2,076,338 was over 90 days past due. Despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due, we had been accounting for the net investment in note receivable on an accrual basis as our Investment Manager believed that all contractual interest and principal payments and the Undrawn Commitment Fee were still collectible based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan net the related estimated costs to sell the collateral. As a result, we continued to recognize finance income on an accrual basis. On July 28, 2015, Varada satisfied its obligations in connection with the secured term loan\nfacility by making a prepayment of $18,524,638, comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $100,000. The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.\n\u00b7 On October 29, 2013, we, together with a third-party creditor, made a superpriority, secured term loan (the Bridge Loan\u201d) to Green Field Energy Services, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, Green Field\u201d), of which our share was $7,500,000. The Bridge Loan matured in 45 days, bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On November 26, 2013, our $7,500,000 portion of the Bridge Loan was rolled into a secured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d) to Green Field. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature in 9 months, bore interest at LIBOR plus 10% per year and was secured by a superpriority security interest in all of Green Field's assets. On March 18, 2014, Green Field satisfied its obligation in connection with the Term Loan by making a prepayment of $7,458,047, comprised of all outstanding principal and accrued interest. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction.\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2014, we, Fund Twelve and ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager (collectively ICON\u201d), entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA to provide a credit facility of up to $29,000,000 (the ICON Loan\u201d), of which our commitment of $3,625,000 was funded on August 27, 2014 (the TMA Initial Closing Date\u201d). The facility was used by TMA to acquire and refinance two platform supply vessels. At inception, the loan bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus a margin of 17%. Upon the acceptance of both vessels by TMA's sub-charterer on September 19, 2014, the margin was reduced to 13%. On November 24, 2014, ICON entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan credit facility agreement with TMA pursuant to which an unaffiliated third party agreed to provide a senior secured term loan in the amount of up to $89,000,000 (the Senior Loan\u201d, and collectively with the ICON Loan, the TMA Facility\u201d) to acquire two additional vessels. The TMA Facility has a term of five years from the TMA Initial Closing Date. As a result of the amendment, the margin for the ICON Loan increased to 15% and repayment of the ICON Loan became subordinated to the repayment of the Senior Loan. The TMA Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority security interest in the four vessels and TMA's right to the collection of hire with respect to earnings from the sub-charterer related to the four vessels. The amendment qualified as a new loan under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and therefore, we wrote off the initial direct costs and deferred revenue associated with the ICON Loan of $77,524 as a charge against finance income. As a condition to the amendment and increased size of the TMA Facility, TMA was required to have all four platform supply vessels under contract by March 31, 2015. Due to TMA's failure to meet such condition, TMA has been in technical default and in payment default while available cash has been swept and applied to the Senior Loan in accordance with the loan agreement. Interest on the ICON Loan is currently being capitalized. While our note receivable has not been paid in accordance with the loan agreement, our collateral position has been strengthened as the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. In January 2016, the remaining two previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. As a result, our Investment Manager is currently engaged in discussions with the senior lender and TMA to amend the TMA Facility and expects that payments to us will recommence in the near future. Based on, among other things, TMA's payment history and the collateral value as of December 31, 2015, our Investment Manager continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due.\n\u00b7 On September 24, 2014, we, Fund Twelve, Fund Fourteen and ICON ECI Fund Sixteen ( Fund Sixteen\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, entered into a secured term loan credit facility agreement with Premier Trailer to provide a credit facility of up to $20,000,000, of which our commitment of $5,000,000 was funded on such date. The loan bears interest at LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 9% per year, and is for a period of six years. The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in all of Premier Trailer's assets, including, without limitation, its fleet of trailers, and the equity interests of Premier Trailer. Premier Trailer's assets, including its fleet of trailers, were valued at approximately $64,088,000 (only a portion of which secures our loan) on the date the transaction occurred.\nOil field Services Equipment\n\u00b7 On February 15, 2013, a joint venture owned 58% by us, 38% by Fund Fourteen and 4% by ICON ECI Partners L.P. ( ECI Partners\u201d), an entity also managed by our Investment Manager, purchased onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac, LLC ( Go Frac\u201d) for $11,803,985. Simultaneously, the equipment was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months, which was scheduled to expire on November 30, 2016. On July 19, 2013, the joint venture purchased additional onshore oil field services equipment from Go Frac for $165,382, which was leased to Go Frac for a period of 45 months and was scheduled to expire on April 30, 2017. On December 30, 2013, the joint venture assigned the remaining 35 and 40 monthly rental payments totaling $7,028,793 due to the joint venture from Go Frac to Element Financial Corp. ( Element\u201d) in exchange for Element making a $6,464,372 non-recourse loan to the joint venture. The\nnon-recourse loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% and was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, declining energy prices negatively impacted Go Frac's financial performance resulting in its failure to satisfy its lease payment obligations in February 2015. In early February 2015, our Investment Manager was informed that Go Frac was ceasing its operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of $4,026,090 based on a third-party appraised fair market value of the leased equipment as of December 31, 2014. The fair market value provided by the independent appraiser was derived based on a combination of the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, our Investment Manager obtained quotes from multiple auctioneers and subsequently an auctioneer was engaged to sell the equipment at an auction. As of March 31, 2015, the equipment met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1,180,260 to write down the equipment to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, of $4,019,740. On May 14, 2015, the equipment was sold at an auction for $5,542,000, the majority of which was remitted directly to Element to satisfy our non-recourse long-term debt obligations of $4,292,780, consisting of unpaid principal and accrued interest. After deducting selling costs of $538,786, we recognized a gain on sale of assets of $983,474. In addition, as a result of Go Frac's default on the lease and our repossession and ultimate sale of the equipment, we recognized additional rental income of $2,638,850, primarily due to the extinguishment of our obligation to return a security deposit to Go Frac pursuant to the terms of the lease.\nMarine Vessels\n\u00b7 On April 2, 2013, two joint ventures each owned 55% by us and 45% by Fund Fourteen purchased two chemical tanker vessels, the Ardmore Capella and the Ardmore Calypso, from wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ardmore. Simultaneously, the vessels were bareboat chartered to the Ardmore subsidiaries for a period of five years. The aggregate purchase price for the vessels was funded by $8,850,000 in cash, $22,750,000 of financing through non-recourse long-term debt and $5,500,000 of financing through subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credits. In December 2015, we were notified by Ardmore that it will be exercising its options to purchase the Ardmore Capella and the Ardmore Calypso in or around April 2016.\n\u00b7 On March 21, 2014, a joint venture owned 12.5% by us, 75% by Fund Twelve and 12.5% by Fund Fourteen, through two indirect subsidiaries, entered into memoranda of agreement to purchase the SIVA Vessels from Siva Global for an aggregate purchase price of $41,600,000. The EPIC Bali and the EPIC Borneo were delivered on March 28, 2014 and April 8, 2014, respectively. The SIVA Vessels were bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Siva Global for a period of eight years upon the delivery of each respective vessel. The SIVA Vessels were each acquired for approximately $3,550,000 in cash, $12,400,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd. ( DVB\u201d) and $4,750,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit.

The vessel was acquired for approximately $12,000,000 in cash, $26,000,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from DVB and $2,000,000 of financing through a subordinated, non-interest-bearing seller's credit. Our contribution to the joint venture was $1,617,158.\nMining Equipment\n\u00b7 On June 29, 2012, a joint venture owned 94.2% by us and 5.8% by ECI Partners purchased certain mining equipment for $8,581,573 that was subject to lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Murray\u201d). The lease was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015, but was extended for one month with an additional lease payment of $229,909. On October 29, 2015, Murray purchased the equipment for $2,038,124. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale.\n\u00b7 On August 3, 2012, a joint venture owned 96% by us and 4% by ECI Partners purchased certain mining equipment for $10,518,850 that was subject to lease with Murray, which expired on October 31, 2015. On September 9, 2013, the joint venture assigned the remaining 25 monthly rental payments totaling $6,812,019 due to the joint venture from Murray to People's Capital and Leasing Corp. ( People's Capital\u201d) in exchange for People's Capital making a $6,413,574 non-recourse loan to the joint venture. The loan was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2015 and bore interest at 5.75% per year. Upon expiration of the lease, Murray purchased the equipment for $2,415,519.

Our contribution to the joint venture was $2,693,395. On October 27, 2015, the joint venture amended the lease with Blackhawk to waive Blackhawk's breach of a financial covenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in consideration for a partial prepayment of $3,502,514, which included an amendment fee of $75,000. In addition, corresponding amendments were made to certain payment and repurchase provisions of the lease to account for the partial prepayment.

The joint venture received an additional amendment fee of $75,000.\nTelecommunications Equipment\n\u00b7 On June 9, 2011, a joint venture owned by us and Fund Fourteen purchased $6,358,763 of telecommunications equipment and simultaneously leased the equipment to Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. ( Global Crossing\u201d). The base term of the lease schedule was for a period of 36 months, commencing on July 1, 2011. On August 11, 2011, we contributed $1,835,843 of capital to the joint venture, inclusive of acquisition fees. Subsequent to our capital contribution, the joint venture was owned 29.2% by us and 70.8% by Fund Fourteen. On October 20, 2011, we exchanged our 29.2% ownership interest in the joint venture for our proportionate share of the lease schedules that were previously owned by the joint venture. Upon completion of the exchange, the joint venture was terminated. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this transaction. On May 30, 2014, Global Crossing exercised its option to purchase the telecommunications equipment prior to lease expiration at the purchase option price of $328,192.

The Fugro Scout was delivered on December 23, 2015 and was simultaneously bareboat chartered to an affiliate of Fugro for a period of 12 years, although such charter can be terminated by the joint venture after year five. The Fugro Scout was acquired for (i) $8,250,000 in cash, (ii) $45,500,000 of financing through a senior secured loan from ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including\ninterim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU 2015-15\u201d), which further specifies the SEC Staff's view on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 will be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU-2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption of both accounting standards updates, debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse long-term debt will be reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets from other assets to non-recourse long-term debt, while debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements will continue to be presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07\u201d), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAn understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves, impairment losses, estimated useful lives and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business:\n\u00b7 Lease classification and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Asset impairments;\n\u00b7 Depreciation;\n\u00b7 Notes receivable and revenue recognition;\n\u00b7 Credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve; and\n\u00b7 Derivative financial instruments.\nLease Classification and Revenue Recognition\nEach equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based upon the terms of each lease. The estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease.\nOur Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its process, the investment committee determines the estimated residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee's business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy.\nThe residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.\nFor finance leases, we capitalize, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease, less unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off. We record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible. The difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straight-line basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets, as appropriate. Initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.\nAsset Impairments\nThe significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period the determination is made.\nThe events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying asset is less than its carrying value or (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset and, if applicable, the remaining obligation to the non-recourse lender. Generally in the latter situation, the residual position relates to equipment subject to third-party non-recourse debt where the lessee remits its rental payments directly to the lender and we do not recover our residual position until the non-recourse debt is repaid in full. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Investment Manager's review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.\nDepreciation\nWe record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation, we first determine the depreciable base, which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nNotes Receivable and Revenue Recognition\nNotes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance, plus costs incurred to originate the loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. We use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest rate method. Interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon the prepayment of a note receivable, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of operations. Our notes receivable may contain a paid-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision. Any PIK interest, if deemed collectible, will be added to the principal balance of the note receivable and is recorded as income.\nCredit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve\nOur Investment Manager monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower's financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower's compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower's payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Manager may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower's facility and meet with a borrower's management to better understand such borrower's financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.\nAs our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Investment Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Investment Manager does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Investment Manager then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.\nFinancing receivables are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Investment Manager's judgment, these accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status.\nIn accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables in non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable.\nWhen our Investment Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings. We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe may enter into derivative transactions for purposes of hedging specific financial exposures, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates on our non-recourse long-term debt. We enter into these instruments only for hedging underlying exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging, except for warrants, which are not hedges. Certain derivatives may not meet the established criteria to be designated as qualifying accounting hedges, even though we believe that these are effective economic hedges.\nWe recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized immediately in earnings unless certain criteria are met. These criteria demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or expected cash flows of the underlying exposure at both the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis and include an evaluation of the counterparty risk and the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the derivative. If these criteria are met, which we must document and assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, we recognize the changes in fair value of such instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of equity on"}
