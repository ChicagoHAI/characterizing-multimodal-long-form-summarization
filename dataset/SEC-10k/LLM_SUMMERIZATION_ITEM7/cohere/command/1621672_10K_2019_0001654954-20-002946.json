MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations together with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, whose actual outcomes involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those stated in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nGeneral\nSuper League Gaming, Inc. ( Super League,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d) is a global leader in the mission to bring live and digital esports entertainment and experiences directly to everyday competitive gamers around the world. Utilizing our proprietary technology platform, Super League operates physical and digital experiences in partnership with publishers of top-tier game titles and owners/operators of a distributed footprint of venues, a network of digital social and viewing channels, and an association/organization of city-based amateur gaming clubs and teams. In addition to providing premium experiences by operating city-vs-city amateur esports leagues and producing thousands of social gaming experiences across North America and our ever-expanding international footprint, the Super League Network features multiple forms of content celebrating the love of play via social media, live streaming and video-on-demand, along with continuous gameplay and leaderboards. Inside our network is Framerate, a large independent social video esports network powered by user-generated highlight reels, and our exclusive proprietary platform Minehut, providing a social and gameplay forum for the avid Minecraft community. Through our partnerships with high-profile venue owners such as Wanda Theatres in China, and Topgolf and Cinemark Theatres in North America, along with ggCircuit, an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and access to a global network of gaming centers, Super League is committed to supporting the development of local, grassroots player communities, while providing a global, scalable infrastructure for esports competition and engagement. We address not only a wide range of gamers across game titles, ages and skill levels, but also a wide range of content-capture beyond just gameplay. This positions Super League as more than a tournament operator; we are a lifestyle and media company focused on capturing, generating, aggregating and distributing content across the genre of all things esports.\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe Super League is on the leading edge of the rapidly growing competitive video gaming industry, which has become an established and vital part of the entertainment landscape. According to Reuters Plus, 2018, gaming is now the world's favorite form of entertainment, as the gaming industry generated more revenue in 2017 than television, movies and music. At the professional level, thousands of professional players on hundreds of teams compete in dozens of high stakes competitions that draw significant audiences, both in person and online. In addition, the value of brand sponsorships, media rights and prize money continue to rise, as are professional team valuations and the purchase price for securing franchises in professional leagues.\nWith NewZoo reporting 2.6 billion gamers globally, we believe there is a larger opportunity for the world of mainstream competitive players who want their own esports experience. These amateur gamers are players who enjoy the competition, the social interaction and community, and the entertainment value associated with playing and watching others play. According to Nielsen Esports Playbook, 2017, competitive amateur gamers take part in over eight hours of gameplay and watch up to nine hours of esports-related content each week. We believe this is an under-served market that seeks their own opportunities for team-based play on real playing fields.\nSuper League is a critically important component in providing the infrastructure for mainstream esports that is synergistic and accretive to the greater esports ecosystem. Over the past five years, we believe we have become the preeminent brand for amateur esports by providing a proprietary software platform that allows our gamers to compete, socialize and spectate premium amateur esports gameplay and entertainment, both physically and digitally. We celebrate everyday competitive gamers and provide a differentiated way for players and spectators to unite around their city clubs and hometown venues for a better, more inclusive social experience not previously available. Not only do we offer premium amateur esports leagues and community, but we are able to leverage our derivative gameplay content to become a comprehensive amateur esports content network. As we expand our city clubs, partner venue network, breadth of game titles and reach into the home, we bring new players into our customer funnel to drive audience growth, and ultimately, consumer and content monetization.\nIn fiscal year 2019, management focused on the acceleration of development of the building blocks in place for our two primary revenue sources: (1) sponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content, and (2) direct to consumer revenues, or gamer monetization. Further, as detailed below, we further de-risked the business, achieving game title fluidity, venue diversity, and an enhanced and more scalable technology platform. We also established a premium advertising model for future monetization and expanded our sales team to facilitate delivery, launched our first effort at meaningful consumer monetization, and expanded globally, both digitally and physically.\nWe offer a variety of ways gamers can engage digitally across our Super League content network and our network of hometown venues serving as the playing fields for recreational esports. In the first quarter of 2020, we expanded our city-based gaming club and league system from 16 to 24 cities across North America, including Canada and Mexico, and we expect further expansion beyond North America in the future.\nThe fundamental drivers of our business model and monetization strategy are creating deep community engagement through our highly contextualized, local experiences that, when coupled with the critical mass of our large digital audiences, provides the depth and volume for premium content and offer monetization differentiated from a more traditional, commoditized advertising model. The combination of our physical venue network and digital programming channels, with Super League's technology platform at the hub, creates the opportunity for not just a share of the player's wallet, but also the advertiser's wallet. We do this by offering brand sponsors and advertisers a premium marketing channel to reach elusive Generation Z and Millennial gamers and offering players ways to access exclusive tournaments, rewards and programming through our Super League consumer subscription offer and other consumer offerings.\nSponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content. Traditionally, we have created our own gameplay experiences to generate audience and content and attracted brand and sponsorship dollars to those offers. This continues to be a core source of revenue.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\nOur potential partners also include game publishers, retailers and brands across various categories who engage us to develop their own customized branded gameplay experiences, powered by our flexible gaming and content technology platform for their own customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\nAdditionally, we can monetize our content commercially through advertising revenues on our own digital channels and by selling our content to third-parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect to Consumer - Gamer monetization. The second way we monetize content is through direct-to-consumer pay walls for access to premium digital and physical experiences and viewing content. We have historically offered a freemium model where consumers can join Super League for free-to-play, casual competitive experiences and charged for access to premium gameplay experiences. We intend to expand our breadth of consumer digital offers in 2020.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo date, our revenues have been weighted towards experience monetization, however we expect to see content monetization begin to emerge as a revenue opportunity.\nKey Performance Indicators. We focus on five key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), as outlined below, to assess our progress and drive revenue growth. The number of game titles and number of retail partner venues drive audience, introducing more players and spectators to Super League's gaming and content platform. Growth in physical and digital experiences across a wider portfolio can increase the number of registered users, including subscribers, and number of gameplay hours which will have a significant impact on our content library. This focus on audience and content generation ultimately impacts our viewership, which has an amplification effect on potential revenue streams and customer acquisition.\nWe significantly outperformed the KPI goals we established at the beginning of 2019, setting us up for fiscal 2020 with a focus on accelerated revenue growth. During 2019, we achieved the following KPI related results:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n\u25cf\n</td> <td>\nGame titles: We ended fiscal 2018 with four game titles in our portfolio and as of the end of fiscal 2019, had over 20 game titles, including the addition of Capcom's Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition during the second quarter of 2019 and Tencent America's Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile ( PUBG Mobile\u201d), during the third quarter of 2019. The increase in game titles reflects the flexibility of our technology platform and our platform's ability to rapidly ingest game titles across a wide spectrum of game genres. Further, our digital content network, which features user-generated content submitted to us from any gamer, anywhere, has a limitless library of featured titles. The diversity of our portfolio differentiates us as a truly game-agnostic platform speaking to a wide spectrum of players and viewers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n\u25cf\n</td> <td>\nRetail Partner Venues: While we are just seeding the build out and monetization of our retail footprint, our national-level announcements with Top golf and ggCircuit LAN centers, as well as our expanded agreement with ggCircuit, which allows us to expand internationally, provides us with access to hundreds of physical venue locations. We ended fiscal 2018 with 46 active venues and grew to over 500 total active venues as of December 31, 2019. Our domestic and global footprint establishes us as a leader in aggregating local esports fields for everyday competitive gamers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n\u25cf\n</td> <td>\nRegistered Users: We ended fiscal 2018 with approximately 300,000 registered users. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our registered users by approximately 227%, to 980,000 registered users. This increase in registered users represents more gamers from whom we can gather user generated content and convert into subscribers and/or upsell into other paid offers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n\u25cf\n</td> <td>\nGameplay Hours: As of December 31, 2019, including our live gaming experiences and our expanding digital gameplay channels, we generated approximately 15.0 million hours of gameplay experiences, as compared to approximately 1.8 million full year 2018 gameplay hours. We are just beginning to explore the ways we can repackage and distribute this significant derivative content library for further monetization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n\u25cf\n</td> <td>\nViewership: Proving that we can attract viewers to our platform and leverage the audiences our brand partners provide, we generated 120.0 million views during fiscal year 2019, compared to our full-year 2018 views of 925,000, leveraging our own programming and experiences and the significant expansion of our audience reach in connection with the acquisition of Framerate. The increase in views resulted in the exponential growth of our monetizable advertising inventory. Additionally, our increase in views was achieved largely via user generated content submitted to us by our community, significantly limiting the production cost and overall investment required to achieve the growth in viewership in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000.\nThe principal purposes of the IPO were to obtain additional capital to support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We have and continue to use the net proceeds received from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have and may continue to use a portion of the net proceeds for the strategic acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may complement our business and or accelerate our growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the underlying agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35.\nAcquisition of Framerate, Inc.\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company and SLG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Framerate, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Framerate\u201d), pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation (the Acquisition\u201d).\nFramerate is a cross-platform esports social video network delivering the best in gameplay highlights, news and entertainment to today's generation of video gamers. The company's focus on user generated content and social distribution changes the way traditional esports video content is produced, distributed and shared by millions of esports fans worldwide. The acquisition of Framerate represents a strategic step in our audience-building efforts with an average of 15 million video views a month during the second half of 2019, built around everyday gamers uploading their personal esports highlight reels for recognition across our wide audience.\nThe Acquisition was consummated on June 6, 2019 when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Effective Date\u201d). As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock at a price per share of $7.4395 (the Closing Shares\u201d).\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares (the Earn-Out Shares\u201d) in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. Upon achievement of the applicable performance-based milestones, if any, one-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nThe Acquisition was approved by the board of directors of each of Super League Gaming, Inc. and Framerate, and was approved by the stockholders of Framerate. Refer to Note 5 to our financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information about the Acquisition.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit, LLC\nOn September 23, 2019, Super League and ggCircuit, LLC ( ggCircuit\u201d), an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and other esports offerings, entered into an expanded commercial partnership agreement ( Expanded Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer-facing brand within ggCircuit's leading gaming center software platform, known as ggLeap.\u201d Under the terms of the Expanded Agreement, commencing with the November 2019 ggLeap software update release, the consumer facing components of ggLeap, including its leaderboards, its competitive seasons and its local loyalty programs, were rebranded as Super League Gaming,\u201d and are managed by Super League. ggLeap is a B2B software platform and B2C application created and owned by ggCircuit. ggLeap is licensed and distributed to owners and operators of video gaming centers throughout the world. It helps gaming centers manage the PCs in their venue, administer loyalty programs for local players, and provides the interface and local operating system through which players log into computers and launch all of their gameplay sessions within the gaming centers where ggLeap is deployed. The December 2019 software release included, the pilot launch of a consumer subscription offer, Super League Prime,\u201d through which players in gaming centers will be able to access special member benefits along with an underpinning global loyalty program for all in players to earn points and prizing for local rewards.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League, including the right to commercially exploit Super League Prime and to feature the Super League Gaming\u201d brand on the applicable ggCircuit customer platform, Super League paid an upfront fee of $340,000 and, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, will pay quarterly fees over the term of the Expanded Agreement ranging from $0 to $150,000, based on contractual revenue levels. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Expanded Agreement, revenues generated in connection with applicable activities under the Expanded Agreement will be shared between Super League and ggCircuit based on contractual revenue sharing percentages. The initial term of the Expanded Agreement commences on the effective date and concludes on the fifth anniversary of the effective date, subject to certain automatic renewal provisions. The upfront fee is included in intangible assets and other, net in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nWanda Cinemas Games Partnership\nIn January 2020, we announced a new partnership with Wanda Cinemas Games, a subsidiary of Chinese media conglomerate Wanda Media. The new alliance will initially bring live, competitive gaming experiences to Wanda's 700+ owned and operated theaters in multiple cities across China, with more activations to be announced in the future. This new venture provides Super League with the opportunity to greatly expand our reach into the world's largest market of 1.2 billion gamers, more than the entire population of the United States.\nIn the agreement, Wanda theatres will be transformed into esports venues hosting live Super League events and tournaments throughout China, driving an entirely new gaming experience for the massive Wanda customer base. Passionate players will see their local movie theatre serve as a competitive and social playing field for the video games they love. The unique gaming experiences created by Super League will propel Wanda venues to the center of the global esports phenomena. The partnership will continue to fuel Super League's focus on the vast opportunity to monetize gamers and the content they generate.\nPrime Subscription Offer\nIn December 2019, we launched in beta Super League Prime, our consumer subscription offer, in North America, with an international launch scheduled for 2020. Super League Prime is a subscription offer that recognizes and rewards players, both locally and globally, through ggCircuit-enabled gaming centers. Players can earn rewards for both the length and quality of their gameplay and gain exposure on national and local leaderboards. All participating players can earn a basic level of loyalty points for prizing redemption locally in-venue. Players who upgrade to our paid monthly subscription offer enjoy additional benefits including the ability to earn points faster, access to exclusive competitions and the Super League global prize vault, and added benefits from our brand sponsors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in the audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following accounting policies were identified during the periods presented, based on activities occurring during the periods presented, as critical and requiring significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In this regard, revenue is recognized when: (i) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (ii) we can identify each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; (iii) we can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; (iv) the contract has commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the entity's future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and (v) it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nSuper League generates revenues and related cash flows from (i) brand and media sponsorships, (ii) Platform-As-A-Service arrangements, (iii) advertising and third-party content and (iv) direct to consumer offers including tournament fees for participation in our physical and online multiplayer gaming experiences, digital subscriptions and merchandise sales.\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. We generate brand and media sponsorship revenues primarily from sales of various forms of sponsorships and promotional campaigns for our online platforms and from sponsorship at our in-person esports experiences. Brand and media sponsorship revenue arrangements may include: exclusive or non-exclusive title sponsorships, marketing benefits, official product status exclusivity, product visibly and additional infrastructure placement, social media rights (including rights to create and post social content and clips), rights to on-screen activations and promotions, display material rights, media rights, hospitality and tickets and merchandising rights. Brand and media sponsorship arrangements typically include contract terms for time periods ranging from several weeks to multi-year arrangements.\nFor brand and media sponsorship arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate platform-as-a-service ( PaaS\u201d) revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to run amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform.\nRevenue for PaaS arrangements for one-off branded experiences and/or the development of content tailored specifically for our partners' distribution channels that provide for a contractual delivery or performance date, is recognized when performance is substantially complete and or delivery occurs. Revenue for PaaS arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time whereby customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligations over the applicable contract term, is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nAdvertising and Third-Party Content Revenue. We generate content through digital and physical experiences that offer opportunities for generating advertising revenue on our proprietary digital channels. In addition, we license our content to third parties seeking esports content for their own distribution channels.\nFor advertising and third-party content arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nDirect to Consumer Revenue. Direct to consumer revenues include tournament fees, digital subscriptions and merchandise. Direct to consumer revenues have primarily consisted of the sale of season passes to gamers for participation in our in-person and or online multiplayer gaming experiences. For the periods presented herein, season passes for gaming experiences were comprised of multi-week packages and one-time, single experience admissions. Digital subscription revenues include revenues related to our Minehut asset acquisition in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community, and Super League Prime subscription offer which was launched in beta in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenue from single experiences is recognized when the experience occurs. Revenue from multi-week packages is recognized over time as the multi-week experiences occur based on estimates of the progress toward complete satisfaction of the applicable offer and related performance obligations. Subscription revenue is recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe make estimates and judgments when determining whether the collectability of accounts receivable is reasonably assured. We assess the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the credit-worthiness of our customers. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, amounts due are recognized when collectability becomes reasonably assured, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, which is generally upon receipt of cash for transactions where collectability may have been an issue. Management's estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenues recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenues. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events and thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nDepending on the complexity of the underlying revenue arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine each parties rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, each parties performance obligations, whether performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time, the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, if different judgments, assumptions and estimates are made regarding revenue arrangements in any specific period, our periodic financial results may be materially affected.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, typically on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity award), which is generally two to four years. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions that affect vesting is recorded only for those awards expected to vest or when the performance criteria are met. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is determined by the product of the number of shares or units granted and the grant date market price of the underlying common stock. The fair value of stock option and common stock purchase warrant awards is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures of awards as they occur.\nGrants of equity-based awards (including warrants) to non-employees in exchange for consulting or other services are accounted for using the fair value of the consideration received (i.e., the value of the goods or services) or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments, including estimating the market price volatility of our common stock, determination of grant dates, future employee stock option exercise behavior and requisite service periods.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nIn connection with the application of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Framerate, as described above, we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. In the context of purchase accounting, the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments and estimates by management, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimated fair values reflected in the purchase accounting rely on management's judgment and the expertise of a third-party valuation firm engaged to assist in concluding on the fair value measurements.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nREVENUES\n</td> <td> $1,084,000\n</td> <td> $1,046,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCOST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td> 513,000\n</td> <td> 684,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td> 571,000\n</td> <td> 362,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, marketing and advertising\n</td> <td> 4,488,000\n</td> <td> 4,319,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology platform and infrastructure\n</td> <td> 4,520,000\n</td> <td> 4,183,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> 12,333,000\n</td> <td> 8,020,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> 21,341,000\n</td> <td> 16,522,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td> (20,770,000)\n</td> <td> (16,160,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n</td> <td> (9,909,000)\n</td> <td> (4,467,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNET LOSS\n</td> <td> $(30,679,000)\n</td> <td> $(20,627,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and\nRevenue\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brand and Media Sponsorships\n</td> <td> $451,000\n</td> <td> $549,000\n</td> <td> $(98,000)\n</td> <td> (18)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Platform-as-a-service\n</td> <td> 532,000\n</td> <td> 291,000\n</td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> 83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and content sales\n</td> <td> 68,000\n</td> <td> 69,000\n</td> <td> (1,000)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct to Consumer\n</td> <td> 33,000\n</td> <td> 137,000\n</td> <td> (104,000)\n</td> <td> (76)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,084,000\n</td> <td> $1,046,000\n</td> <td> $38,000\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue for fiscal year 2019 increased $38,000, or 4%, compared to fiscal year 2018. Revenues for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nSponsorships and Advertising:\n\u25cf\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. Period to period changes in brand and media sponsorship revenues are attributable to fluctuations in brand and media sponsorship activities period to period, which is based on the specific partnership arrangements with activities during a particular period, the related performance obligations satisfied during the period and the contractual consideration associated with the activities during the period. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues for our Red Bull North America, Inc. ( Red Bull\u201d) brand partnership, Red Bull Allstars experience in April 2019, Logitech G Challenge and Play/Train/Win online tournaments, Sony related build competitions and related experiences and our Red Games Lego Brawls live stream sponsorship activation. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2018 was primarily comprised of revenues from our Logitech, Inc. and Red Bull brand sponsorships and our 2018 Red Bull Allstars experience.\n\u25cf\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate PaaS revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to hold amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform. PaaS revenue for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from our Samsung Fortnite event held in New York in March 2019, Capcom, Inc. related to our Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition partnership, Sony related to certain build competitions and related experiences, Sprint related to our Sprint 5G LA activation, our Cox Paladins gameplay experience and our Tencent Games and OnePlus Mobile Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile, or PUBG Mobile, premium content, competitive experiences and sponsorship activation.\n\u25cf\nAdvertising and Content Sales. Revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from campaigns launched related to our Framerate acquisition and advertising revenues from Snapchat related content sales and our Minehut digital property. Revenues for fiscal year 2018 included revenues from the sale of gameplay and other content generated by us to Nickelodeon (third-party broadcaster) to supplement their YouTube channel programming. We expect to continue to expand our advertising revenue and revenue from the sale of our proprietary and third-party content derived from our technology platform in future periods, as we expand our advertising inventory, viewership and related sales activities.\nDirect to Consumer:\n\u25cf\nThe decrease in direct to consumer revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of paid events held during fiscal year 2019, as compared to the prior year period. During fiscal year 2019, we held paid events and a higher number of events that were free to play, consistent with our strategic focus on increasing the volume of new gamers and spectators introduced into our customer funnel, to increase the number of registered users on our platform, drive consumer conversion, and increase the overall awareness of the Super League brand and technology platform offerings. We intend to continue to offer a combination of paid and free to play experiences going forward. Digital subscription revenues included in direct to consumer revenues for fiscal year 2019 were primarily comprised of subscription revenues related to our Minehut digital property acquired in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> $513,000\n</td> <td> $684,000\n</td> <td> $(171,000)\n</td> <td> 25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2019 decreased $171,000 or 25% compared to fiscal year 2018, as compared to a 4% increase in revenues for the same periods. The trend in cost of sales for the periods presented was primarily due to operational efficiencies and lower direct costs incurred for fiscal year 2019 in connection with our physical and digital experiences.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, Marketing and Advertising\n</td> <td> $4,488,000\n</td> <td> $4,319,000\n</td> <td> $169,000\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology Platform and Infrastructure\n</td> <td> 4,520,000\n</td> <td> 4,183,000\n</td> <td> 337,000\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> 12,333,000\n</td> <td> 8,020,000\n</td> <td> 4,313,000\n</td> <td> 54%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> $21,341,000\n</td> <td> $16,522,000\n</td> <td> $4,819,000\n</td> <td> 29%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, Marketing and Advertising. The increase in selling, marketing and advertising expense was primarily due to a 27% increase in personnel costs associated with the continued expansion of our operations requiring additional internal resources across our product, creative and commercial departments, and an increase in marketing and promotional experiences focused on widening our customer funnel and attracting increased numbers of registered users to our platform. The increase included increased costs related to contract labor, influencers, event operations, content capture and other costs to execute various marketing and promotional experiences during the period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of noncash in-kind advertising costs, totaling $667,000, which were initially capitalized pursuant to a June 2017 third-party investment agreement. The investment agreement included in-kind advertising for use in future periods, valued at $1.0 million, as a component of the consideration paid to us in exchange for equity in the Company. The prepaid advertising cost was amortized over an 18-month period ending as of December 31, 2018.\nTechnology Platform and Infrastructure. Technology platform and infrastructure costs include (i) allocated personnel costs, including salaries, noncash stock compensation, taxes and benefits related to our internal software developers and engineers, employed by Super League, engaged in the operation, maintenance, management, administration, testing, development and enhancement of our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (ii) third-party contract software development and engineering resources engaged in developing and enhancing our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (iii) the amortization of capitalized internal use software costs, and (iv) technology platform related cloud services and broadband costs. Capitalized internal use software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life. The period over period increase primarily reflects an increase in engineering headcount since the end of the prior year in connection with the expansion of our engineering and internal use software development activities and an increase in technology platform related cloud services costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td> $2,755,000\n</td> <td> $1,902,000\n</td> <td> $853,000\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office and facilities\n</td> <td> 403,000\n</td> <td> 367,000\n</td> <td> 36,000\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> 911,000\n</td> <td> 816,000\n</td> <td> 95,000\n</td> <td> 12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> 5,453,000\n</td> <td> 3,236,000\n</td> <td> 2,217,000\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 445,000\n</td> <td> 851,000\n</td> <td> (406,000)\n</td> <td> (-48)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> 2,366,000\n</td> <td> 848,000\n</td> <td> 1,518,000\n</td> <td> 179%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td> $12,333,000\n</td> <td> $8,020,000\n</td> <td> $4,313,000\n</td> <td> 54%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA summary of the main drivers of the net increase in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented is as follows:\n\u25cf\nGeneral and administrative personnel costs increased 45%, primarily due to approximately $455,000 of management performance-based bonuses paid in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based milestones during fiscal year 2019, including the closing of the IPO and other operational performance targets. The increase in personnel costs also reflects an increase in recruiting expense and a 4% net increase in personnel expense compared to the prior year period in connection with the expansion of our operations. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, across all departments, we had average full-time equivalent employees of 51 and 44, respectively.\n\u25cf\nOffice and facilities expense increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in leased office space commencing in June 2018 in connection with the expansion of our SLG.TV studio operations.\n\u25cf\nNoncash stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expense increased 69%, primarily due to certain performance options and warrants previously granted to certain executives, which vested upon the achievement of certain performance-based milestones, pursuant to October 2018 amended employee agreements and/or vesting conditions in the underlying equity grant agreements. Performance targets included the completion of our IPO in February 2019 and other operational performance targets. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 300,000 of performance-based stock options and warrants vested with grant date fair values ranging from $8.28 to $8.50, resulting in noncash stock compensation expense of $2,617,000. The remaining increase also reflects $58,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Framerate, as described at Note 8 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u25cf\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 48% due primarily to a decrease in scheduled amortization related to fully depreciated assets with useful lives that expired during fiscal 2019 or prior, and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain networking and related equipment disposed of during fiscal 2019.\n\u25cf\nProfessional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased 12% and 179%, respectively, primarily due to a significant increase in directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with our February 2019 IPO, and an increase in legal, audit and other administrative public company costs.\nOther Income (expense)\nOther income (expense), net, for fiscal year 2019 and 2018, totaling $9,909,000 and $4,467,000, respectively, was primarily comprised of interest expense related to the convertible notes outstanding during the periods presented as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount on convertible notes\n</td> <td> $2,475,000\n</td> <td> $1,394,000\n</td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> 78%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest expense on convertible notes\n</td> <td> 187,000\n</td> <td> 311,000\n</td> <td> (124,000)\n</td> <td> (40)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of convertible note issuance costs\n</td> <td> 209,000\n</td> <td> 143,000\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> 46%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td> 7,067,000\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 7,067,000\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> $9,938,000\n</td> <td> $1,848,000\n</td> <td> $8,090,000\n</td> <td>\n>300%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the periods presented primarily relates to the issuance of 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, commencing in February 2018 through August 2018, as described below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Principal and interest as of February 27, 2019, the closing date of the IPO and December 31, 2018 totaled $13,793,000 and $13,606,000, respectively. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35. As of and subsequent to February 27, 2019, we have no debt outstanding. As a result of the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes (defined below) and the application of conversion accounting, the Company recorded an immediate charge to interest expense of $1,384,000, representing the write-off of the unamortized balance of debt discounts associated with the 2018 warrants and cash commissions and warrants issued to third parties. Unamortized debt discounts at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,684,000, respectively.\nThe non-detachable conversion feature embedded in the 2018 Notes provides for a conversion rate that was below market value at the commitment date, and therefore, represented a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF\u201d). The BCF is generally recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the debt proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of the BCF to additional paid-in capital. The resulting convertible debt discount is recognized as interest expense using the effective yield method. However, the conversion feature associated with the 2018 Notes was not exercisable until the consummation of an initial public offering by the Company of its common stock, and therefore, was not required to be recognized in earnings until the IPO related contingency was resolved, which occurred on the IPO Closing Date. The commitment date is the IPO Closing Date and the commitment date stock price was $11.00 per share. The intrinsic value of the BCF on the IPO Closing Date, which was limited to the net proceeds allocated to the debt on a relative fair value basis, was approximately $7,067,000, and is reflected as additional interest expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had working capital of approximately $8.7 million and ($8.0) million, respectively, and sustained cumulative losses since inception attributable to common stockholders of approximately $85.8 million. Total noncash charges included in accumulated deficit since inception, primarily related to noncash stock compensation, restricted stock units issued in connection with a license agreement, amortization of the discount on the 2018 Notes (defined below) and in-kind advertising expense, totaled approximately $34.6 million. On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000. During Fiscal 2018, the Company issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, as described below, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $13,000,000. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock as described below. Approximately 1.3 million of the warrants issued in conjunction with the 2018 Notes are callable at the election of the Company at any time following the completion of our IPO.\nTo date, our principal sources of capital used to fund our operations have been the net proceeds we received from sales of equity securities and proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt, as described herein. We have and will continue to use significant capital for the growth and development of our business. Our management team expects operating losses to continue in the near term in connection with the pursuit of our strategic objectives. As such, we believe our current cash position, absent receipt of additional capital either from operations or that may be available from future issuance(s) of common stock or debt financings, is not sufficient to fund our planned operations for the twelve months following the date of this Report. We believe these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1A of this Report.\nWe are focused on expanding our service offerings and revenue growth opportunities through internal development, collaborations, and through one or more strategic acquisitions. Management is currently exploring several alternatives for raising capital to facilitate our growth and execute our business strategy, including strategic partnerships or other forms of equity or debt financings.\nWe continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. To finance such strategic acquisitions, we may find it necessary to raise additional equity capital, incur additional debt, or both. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption periodically and such volatility and disruption may occur in the future. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans which, in turn, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nCash Flows for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes the change in cash balances for the periods presented:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> $(13,646,000)\n</td> <td> $(10,680,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> (3,164,000)\n</td> <td> (866,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> 22,478,000\n</td> <td> 12,611,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash\n</td> <td> 5,668,000\n</td> <td> 1,065,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, at beginning of period\n</td> <td> 2,774,000\n</td> <td> 1,709,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, at end of period\n</td> <td> $8,442,000\n</td> <td> $2,774,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was $13,646,000, which primarily reflected our net GAAP loss of $30,679,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net GAAP loss to net cash used in operating activities of $17,033,000, which included $6,217,000 of noncash stock compensation charges, $2,871,000 of noncash accrued interest and accretion of debt discount, $7,067,0000 of noncash interest expense related to the recognition of the beneficial conversion feature upon the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes upon close of the IPO, and depreciation and amortization of $862,000. Changes in working capital primarily reflected the impact of the prepayment of increased directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with the consummation of our IPO and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2018 was $10,680,000, which primarily reflected our net loss of $20,627,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities of $9,947,000, which included $3,942,000 of non-cash stock compensation, noncash amortization of prepaid in-kind advertising totaling $667,000 and $1,106,000 of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges. Changes in working capital primarily reflected increases in receivables and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course of business during the period.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities.

On June 3, 2019, the Company and Merger Sub, entered into the Merger Agreement with Framerate, pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation. The Acquisition was consummated on the Effective Date when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $7.4395, which price was equal to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over the five trading days preceding the date of the Merger Agreement, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. One-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit. On September 23, 2019, the Company and ggCircuit entered into an Expanded Agreement pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer facing brand within ggCircuit's B2B gaming center software platform. In consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League, Super League paid an upfront fee of $340,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The upfront fee is included as \"Licenses\" in intangible assets and other assets, net, in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nCapitalized Internal Use Software Costs. Software development costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Software development costs incurred during the preliminary stages of development are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and training costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upgrades or enhancements to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable estimated useful life.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash flows from financing activities were comprised of the following for the periods presented:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td> $22,458,000\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from convertible notes payable, net of issuance cost\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 12,611,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from common stock purchase warrant exercises\n</td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> $22,478,000\n</td> <td> $12,611,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInitial Public Offering. On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,00. The net proceeds received from the offering have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have, and may in the future, use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may compliment or business and or accelerate or growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nPursuant to the related underwriting agreement, in connection with the completion of the IPO, for the purchase price of $50.00, we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 3.0% of the shares sold in the IPO, or 68,182 shares, at an exercise price of $11.00 per share (the Underwriters' Warrants\u201d). The Underwriters' Warrants are exercisable during the period commencing from the date of the close of the IPO and ending five years from the closing date of the IPO. The Underwriters' Warrants represent additional noncash offering costs, with an estimated grant date fair value of $547,000, which was reflected in additional-paid-in capital when issued and as a corresponding offering cost in the statement of shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nConvertible Debt Issuances. In February and April 2018, we issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $3,000,000 (the Initial 2018 Notes\u201d). The Initial 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the close of a $15,000,000 equity financing ( Qualifying Equity Financing\u201d) by us, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into equity or equity-linked securities sold in a Qualifying Equity Financing based upon a conversion rate equal to (x) a 10% discount to the price per share of a Qualifying Equity Financing, with (y) a floor of $10.80 per share. In addition, the holders of the Initial 2018 Notes were collectively issued warrants to purchase approximately 55,559 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.80 per share and a term of five years (the Initial 2018 Warrants\u201d).\nIn May through August 2018, we issued additional 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $10,000,000 (the Additional 2018 Notes\u201d). In May 2018, all of the Initial 2018 Notes and related accrued interest, totaling $3,056,182, were converted into the Additional 2018 Notes, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of $13,056,182 (hereinafter collectively, the 2018 Notes\u201d). The holders of the converted Initial 2018 Notes retained their respective Initial 2018 Warrants.\nThe 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of the closing of an IPO of our common stock on a national securities exchange or April 30, 2019, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into shares of common stock upon the closing of the IPO at the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the price per share of the IPO. In addition, the holders of the 2018 Notes were collectively issued 1,396,383 warrants to purchase common stock equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes divided by $9.35 per share (the 2018 Warrants\u201d). The 2018 Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years, commencing on the close of the IPO, at an exercise price equal to the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the IPO price per share and are callable at our election at any time following the closing of an IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35. As of December 31, 2019, there is no debt outstanding. Refer to Note 6 to the accompany financial statements elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, except as described below, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures, nor do we have any committed lines of credit, noncancelable operating leases obligations, other committed funding or long-term debt, and no guarantees. The operating lease for our corporate headquarters expired on May 31, 2017 and was subsequently amended to operate on a month-to-month basis.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League in connection with the Expanded Agreement described above, including the right to commercially exploit Super League Prime and to feature the Super League Gaming\u201d brand on the applicable ggCircuit customer platform, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, Super League will pay quarterly fees over the term of the Expanded Agreement ranging from $0 to $150,000, based on contractual revenue levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder's equity or that are not reflected in our financial statements included elsewhere herein. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRelaxed Ongoing Reporting Requirements\nUpon the completion of our IPO, we elected to report as an emerging growth company\u201d (as defined in the JOBS Act) under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies,\u201d including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf\ntaking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u25cf\nbeing permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25cf\nbeing exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe are subject to ongoing public reporting requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not emerging growth companies,\u201d and our stockholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31.", "summary": "- Super League Gaming, Inc.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations together with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, whose actual outcomes involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those stated in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nGeneral\nSuper League Gaming, Inc. ( Super League,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d) is a global leader in the mission to bring live and digital esports entertainment and experiences directly to everyday competitive gamers around the world. Utilizing our proprietary technology platform, Super League operates physical and digital experiences in partnership with publishers of top-tier game titles and owners/operators of a distributed footprint of venues, a network of digital social and viewing channels, and an association/organization of city-based amateur gaming clubs and teams. In addition to providing premium experiences by operating city-vs-city amateur esports leagues and producing thousands of social gaming experiences across North America and our ever-expanding international footprint, the Super League Network features multiple forms of content celebrating the love of play via social media, live streaming and video-on-demand, along with continuous gameplay and leaderboards. Inside our network is Framerate, a large independent social video esports network powered by user-generated highlight reels, and our exclusive proprietary platform Minehut, providing a social and gameplay forum for the avid Minecraft community. Through our partnerships with high-profile venue owners such as Wanda Theatres in China, and Topgolf and Cinemark Theatres in North America, along with ggCircuit, an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and access to a global network of gaming centers, Super League is committed to supporting the development of local, grassroots player communities, while providing a global, scalable infrastructure for esports competition and engagement. We address not only a wide range of gamers across game titles, ages and skill levels, but also a wide range of content-capture beyond just gameplay. This positions Super League as more than a tournament operator; we are a lifestyle and media company focused on capturing, generating, aggregating and distributing content across the genre of all things esports.\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe Super League is on the leading edge of the rapidly growing competitive video gaming industry, which has become an established and vital part of the entertainment landscape. According to Reuters Plus, 2018, gaming is now the world's favorite form of entertainment, as the gaming industry generated more revenue in 2017 than television, movies and music. At the professional level, thousands of professional players on hundreds of teams compete in dozens of high stakes competitions that draw significant audiences, both in person and online. In addition, the value of brand sponsorships, media rights and prize money continue to rise, as are professional team valuations and the purchase price for securing franchises in professional leagues.\nWith NewZoo reporting 2.6 billion gamers globally, we believe there is a larger opportunity for the world of mainstream competitive players who want their own esports experience. These amateur gamers are players who enjoy the competition, the social interaction and community, and the entertainment value associated with playing and watching others play. According to Nielsen Esports Playbook, 2017, competitive amateur gamers take part in over eight hours of gameplay and watch up to nine hours of esports-related content each week. We believe this is an under-served market that seeks their own opportunities for team-based play on real playing fields.\nSuper League is a critically important component in providing the infrastructure for mainstream esports that is synergistic and accretive to the greater esports ecosystem. Over the past five years, we believe we have become the preeminent brand for amateur esports by providing a proprietary software platform that allows our gamers to compete, socialize and spectate premium amateur esports gameplay and entertainment, both physically and digitally. We celebrate everyday competitive gamers and provide a differentiated way for players and spectators to unite around their city clubs and hometown venues for a better, more inclusive social experience not previously available. Not only do we offer premium amateur esports leagues and community, but we are able to leverage our derivative gameplay content to become a comprehensive amateur esports content network. As we expand our city clubs, partner venue network, breadth of game titles and reach into the home, we bring new players into our customer funnel to drive audience growth, and ultimately, consumer and content monetization.\nIn fiscal year 2019, management focused on the acceleration of development of the building blocks in place for our two primary revenue sources: (1) sponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content, and (2) direct to consumer revenues, or gamer monetization. Further, as detailed below, we further de-risked the business, achieving game title fluidity, venue diversity, and an enhanced and more scalable technology platform. We also established a premium advertising model for future monetization and expanded our sales team to facilitate delivery, launched our first effort at meaningful consumer monetization, and expanded globally, both digitally and physically.\nWe offer a variety of ways gamers can engage digitally across our Super League content network and our network of hometown venues serving as the playing fields for recreational esports. In the first quarter of 2020, we expanded our city-based gaming club and league system from 16 to 24 cities across North America, including Canada and Mexico, and we expect further expansion beyond North America in the future.\nThe fundamental drivers of our business model and monetization strategy are creating deep community engagement through our highly contextualized, local experiences that, when coupled with the critical mass of our large digital audiences, provides the depth and volume for premium content and offer monetization differentiated from a more traditional, commoditized advertising model. The combination of our physical venue network and digital programming channels, with Super League's technology platform at the hub, creates the opportunity for not just a share of the player's wallet, but also the advertiser's wallet. We do this by offering brand sponsors and advertisers a premium marketing channel to reach elusive Generation Z and Millennial gamers and offering players ways to access exclusive tournaments, rewards and programming through our Super League consumer subscription offer and other consumer offerings.\nSponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content. Traditionally, we have created our own gameplay experiences to generate audience and content and attracted brand and sponsorship dollars to those offers. This continues to be a core source of revenue.\n Our potential partners also include game publishers, retailers and brands across various categories who engage us to develop their own customized branded gameplay experiences, powered by our flexible gaming and content technology platform for their own customers. \n Additionally, we can monetize our content commercially through advertising revenues on our own digital channels and by selling our content to third-parties. \nDirect to Consumer - Gamer monetization. The second way we monetize content is through direct-to-consumer pay walls for access to premium digital and physical experiences and viewing content. We have historically offered a freemium model where consumers can join Super League for free-to-play, casual competitive experiences and charged for access to premium gameplay experiences. We intend to expand our breadth of consumer digital offers in 2020.\n \nTo date, our revenues have been weighted towards experience monetization, however we expect to see content monetization begin to emerge as a revenue opportunity.\nKey Performance Indicators. We focus on five key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), as outlined below, to assess our progress and drive revenue growth. The number of game titles and number of retail partner venues drive audience, introducing more players and spectators to Super League's gaming and content platform. Growth in physical and digital experiences across a wider portfolio can increase the number of registered users, including subscribers, and number of gameplay hours which will have a significant impact on our content library. This focus on audience and content generation ultimately impacts our viewership, which has an amplification effect on potential revenue streams and customer acquisition.\nWe significantly outperformed the KPI goals we established at the beginning of 2019, setting us up for fiscal 2020 with a focus on accelerated revenue growth. During 2019, we achieved the following KPI related results:\n \u25cf Game titles: We ended fiscal 2018 with four game titles in our portfolio and as of the end of fiscal 2019, had over 20 game titles, including the addition of Capcom's Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition during the second quarter of 2019 and Tencent America's Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile ( PUBG Mobile\u201d), during the third quarter of 2019. The increase in game titles reflects the flexibility of our technology platform and our platform's ability to rapidly ingest game titles across a wide spectrum of game genres. Further, our digital content network, which features user-generated content submitted to us from any gamer, anywhere, has a limitless library of featured titles. The diversity of our portfolio differentiates us as a truly game-agnostic platform speaking to a wide spectrum of players and viewers. \n \u25cf Retail Partner Venues: While we are just seeding the build out and monetization of our retail footprint, our national-level announcements with Top golf and ggCircuit LAN centers, as well as our expanded agreement with ggCircuit, which allows us to expand internationally, provides us with access to hundreds of physical venue locations. We ended fiscal 2018 with 46 active venues and grew to over 500 total active venues as of December 31, 2019. Our domestic and global footprint establishes us as a leader in aggregating local esports fields for everyday competitive gamers. \n \u25cf Registered Users: We ended fiscal 2018 with approximately 300,000 registered users. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our registered users by approximately 227%, to 980,000 registered users. This increase in registered users represents more gamers from whom we can gather user generated content and convert into subscribers and/or upsell into other paid offers. \n \u25cf Gameplay Hours: As of December 31, 2019, including our live gaming experiences and our expanding digital gameplay channels, we generated approximately 15.0 million hours of gameplay experiences, as compared to approximately 1.8 million full year 2018 gameplay hours. We are just beginning to explore the ways we can repackage and distribute this significant derivative content library for further monetization. \n \u25cf Viewership: Proving that we can attract viewers to our platform and leverage the audiences our brand partners provide, we generated 120.0 million views during fiscal year 2019, compared to our full-year 2018 views of 925,000, leveraging our own programming and experiences and the significant expansion of our audience reach in connection with the acquisition of Framerate. The increase in views resulted in the exponential growth of our monetizable advertising inventory. Additionally, our increase in views was achieved largely via user generated content submitted to us by our community, significantly limiting the production cost and overall investment required to achieve the growth in viewership in 2019. \nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000.\nThe principal purposes of the IPO were to obtain additional capital to support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We have and continue to use the net proceeds received from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have and may continue to use a portion of the net proceeds for the strategic acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may complement our business and or accelerate our growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the underlying agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35.\nAcquisition of Framerate, Inc.\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company and SLG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Framerate, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Framerate\u201d), pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation (the Acquisition\u201d).\nFramerate is a cross-platform esports social video network delivering the best in gameplay highlights, news and entertainment to today's generation of video gamers. The company's focus on user generated content and social distribution changes the way traditional esports video content is produced, distributed and shared by millions of esports fans worldwide. The acquisition of Framerate represents a strategic step in our audience-building efforts with an average of 15 million video views a month during the second half of 2019, built around everyday gamers uploading their personal esports highlight reels for recognition across our wide audience.\nThe Acquisition was consummated on June 6, 2019 when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Effective Date\u201d). As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock at a price per share of $7.4395 (the Closing Shares\u201d).\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares (the Earn-Out Shares\u201d) in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. Upon achievement of the applicable performance-based milestones, if any, one-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nThe Acquisition was approved by the board of directors of each of Super League Gaming, Inc. and Framerate, and was approved by the stockholders of Framerate. Refer to Note 5 to our financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information about the Acquisition.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit, LLC\nOn September 23, 2019, Super League and ggCircuit, LLC ( ggCircuit\u201d), an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and other esports offerings, entered into an expanded commercial partnership agreement ( Expanded Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer-facing brand within ggCircuit's leading gaming center software platform, known as ggLeap.\u201d Under the terms of the Expanded Agreement, commencing with the November 2019 ggLeap software update release, the consumer facing components of ggLeap, including its leaderboards, its competitive seasons and its local loyalty programs, were rebranded as Super League Gaming,\u201d and are managed by Super League. ggLeap is a B2B software platform and B2C application created and owned by ggCircuit. ggLeap is licensed and distributed to owners and operators of video gaming centers throughout the world.

The upfront fee is included in intangible assets and other, net in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nWanda Cinemas Games Partnership\nIn January 2020, we announced a new partnership with Wanda Cinemas Games, a subsidiary of Chinese media conglomerate Wanda Media. The new alliance will initially bring live, competitive gaming experiences to Wanda's 700+ owned and operated theaters in multiple cities across China, with more activations to be announced in the future. This new venture provides Super League with the opportunity to greatly expand our reach into the world's largest market of 1.2 billion gamers, more than the entire population of the United States.\nIn the agreement, Wanda theatres will be transformed into esports venues hosting live Super League events and tournaments throughout China, driving an entirely new gaming experience for the massive Wanda customer base.

Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in the audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following accounting policies were identified during the periods presented, based on activities occurring during the periods presented, as critical and requiring significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In this regard, revenue is recognized when: (i) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (ii) we can identify each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; (iii) we can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; (iv) the contract has commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the entity's future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and (v) it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nSuper League generates revenues and related cash flows from (i) brand and media sponsorships, (ii) Platform-As-A-Service arrangements, (iii) advertising and third-party content and (iv) direct to consumer offers including tournament fees for participation in our physical and online multiplayer gaming experiences, digital subscriptions and merchandise sales.\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. We generate brand and media sponsorship revenues primarily from sales of various forms of sponsorships and promotional campaigns for our online platforms and from sponsorship at our in-person esports experiences. Brand and media sponsorship revenue arrangements may include: exclusive or non-exclusive title sponsorships, marketing benefits, official product status exclusivity, product visibly and additional infrastructure placement, social media rights (including rights to create and post social content and clips), rights to on-screen activations and promotions, display material rights, media rights, hospitality and tickets and merchandising rights. Brand and media sponsorship arrangements typically include contract terms for time periods ranging from several weeks to multi-year arrangements.\nFor brand and media sponsorship arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate platform-as-a-service ( PaaS\u201d) revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to run amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform.\nRevenue for PaaS arrangements for one-off branded experiences and/or the development of content tailored specifically for our partners' distribution channels that provide for a contractual delivery or performance date, is recognized when performance is substantially complete and or delivery occurs. Revenue for PaaS arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time whereby customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligations over the applicable contract term, is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nAdvertising and Third-Party Content Revenue. We generate content through digital and physical experiences that offer opportunities for generating advertising revenue on our proprietary digital channels. In addition, we license our content to third parties seeking esports content for their own distribution channels.\nFor advertising and third-party content arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nDirect to Consumer Revenue. Direct to consumer revenues include tournament fees, digital subscriptions and merchandise. Direct to consumer revenues have primarily consisted of the sale of season passes to gamers for participation in our in-person and or online multiplayer gaming experiences. For the periods presented herein, season passes for gaming experiences were comprised of multi-week packages and one-time, single experience admissions. Digital subscription revenues include revenues related to our Minehut asset acquisition in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community, and Super League Prime subscription offer which was launched in beta in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenue from single experiences is recognized when the experience occurs. Revenue from multi-week packages is recognized over time as the multi-week experiences occur based on estimates of the progress toward complete satisfaction of the applicable offer and related performance obligations. Subscription revenue is recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe make estimates and judgments when determining whether the collectability of accounts receivable is reasonably assured. We assess the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the credit-worthiness of our customers. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, amounts due are recognized when collectability becomes reasonably assured, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, which is generally upon receipt of cash for transactions where collectability may have been an issue. Management's estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenues recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenues. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events and thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nDepending on the complexity of the underlying revenue arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine each parties rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, each parties performance obligations, whether performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time, the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, if different judgments, assumptions and estimates are made regarding revenue arrangements in any specific period, our periodic financial results may be materially affected.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, typically on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity award), which is generally two to four years. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions that affect vesting is recorded only for those awards expected to vest or when the performance criteria are met. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is determined by the product of the number of shares or units granted and the grant date market price of the underlying common stock. The fair value of stock option and common stock purchase warrant awards is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures of awards as they occur.\nGrants of equity-based awards (including warrants) to non-employees in exchange for consulting or other services are accounted for using the fair value of the consideration received (i.e., the value of the goods or services) or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments, including estimating the market price volatility of our common stock, determination of grant dates, future employee stock option exercise behavior and requisite service periods.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nIn connection with the application of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Framerate, as described above, we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. In the context of purchase accounting, the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments and estimates by management, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimated fair values reflected in the purchase accounting rely on management's judgment and the expertise of a third-party valuation firm engaged to assist in concluding on the fair value measurements.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nComparison of the Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and\nRevenue\n\nRevenue for fiscal year 2019 increased $38,000, or 4%, compared to fiscal year 2018. Revenues for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nSponsorships and Advertising:\n\u25cf\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. Period to period changes in brand and media sponsorship revenues are attributable to fluctuations in brand and media sponsorship activities period to period, which is based on the specific partnership arrangements with activities during a particular period, the related performance obligations satisfied during the period and the contractual consideration associated with the activities during the period. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues for our Red Bull North America, Inc. ( Red Bull\u201d) brand partnership, Red Bull Allstars experience in April 2019, Logitech G Challenge and Play/Train/Win online tournaments, Sony related build competitions and related experiences and our Red Games Lego Brawls live stream sponsorship activation. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2018 was primarily comprised of revenues from our Logitech, Inc. and Red Bull brand sponsorships and our 2018 Red Bull Allstars experience.\n\u25cf\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate PaaS revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to hold amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform. PaaS revenue for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from our Samsung Fortnite event held in New York in March 2019, Capcom, Inc. related to our Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition partnership, Sony related to certain build competitions and related experiences, Sprint related to our Sprint 5G LA activation, our Cox Paladins gameplay experience and our Tencent Games and OnePlus Mobile Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile, or PUBG Mobile, premium content, competitive experiences and sponsorship activation.\n\u25cf\nAdvertising and Content Sales. Revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from campaigns launched related to our Framerate acquisition and advertising revenues from Snapchat related content sales and our Minehut digital property. Revenues for fiscal year 2018 included revenues from the sale of gameplay and other content generated by us to Nickelodeon (third-party broadcaster) to supplement their YouTube channel programming. We expect to continue to expand our advertising revenue and revenue from the sale of our proprietary and third-party content derived from our technology platform in future periods, as we expand our advertising inventory, viewership and related sales activities.\nDirect to Consumer:\n\u25cf\nThe decrease in direct to consumer revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of paid events held during fiscal year 2019, as compared to the prior year period. During fiscal year 2019, we held paid events and a higher number of events that were free to play, consistent with our strategic focus on increasing the volume of new gamers and spectators introduced into our customer funnel, to increase the number of registered users on our platform, drive consumer conversion, and increase the overall awareness of the Super League brand and technology platform offerings. We intend to continue to offer a combination of paid and free to play experiences going forward. Digital subscription revenues included in direct to consumer revenues for fiscal year 2019 were primarily comprised of subscription revenues related to our Minehut digital property acquired in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2019 decreased $171,000 or 25% compared to fiscal year 2018, as compared to a 4% increase in revenues for the same periods. The trend in cost of sales for the periods presented was primarily due to operational efficiencies and lower direct costs incurred for fiscal year 2019 in connection with our physical and digital experiences.\nOperating Expenses\n\nSelling, Marketing and Advertising. The increase in selling, marketing and advertising expense was primarily due to a 27% increase in personnel costs associated with the continued expansion of our operations requiring additional internal resources across our product, creative and commercial departments, and an increase in marketing and promotional experiences focused on widening our customer funnel and attracting increased numbers of registered users to our platform. The increase included increased costs related to contract labor, influencers, event operations, content capture and other costs to execute various marketing and promotional experiences during the period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of noncash in-kind advertising costs, totaling $667,000, which were initially capitalized pursuant to a June 2017 third-party investment agreement. The investment agreement included in-kind advertising for use in future periods, valued at $1.0 million, as a component of the consideration paid to us in exchange for equity in the Company. The prepaid advertising cost was amortized over an 18-month period ending as of December 31, 2018.\nTechnology Platform and Infrastructure. Technology platform and infrastructure costs include (i) allocated personnel costs, including salaries, noncash stock compensation, taxes and benefits related to our internal software developers and engineers, employed by Super League, engaged in the operation, maintenance, management, administration, testing, development and enhancement of our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (ii) third-party contract software development and engineering resources engaged in developing and enhancing our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (iii) the amortization of capitalized internal use software costs, and (iv) technology platform related cloud services and broadband costs. Capitalized internal use software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life. The period over period increase primarily reflects an increase in engineering headcount since the end of the prior year in connection with the expansion of our engineering and internal use software development activities and an increase in technology platform related cloud services costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\n\nA summary of the main drivers of the net increase in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented is as follows:\n\u25cf\nGeneral and administrative personnel costs increased 45%, primarily due to approximately $455,000 of management performance-based bonuses paid in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based milestones during fiscal year 2019, including the closing of the IPO and other operational performance targets. The increase in personnel costs also reflects an increase in recruiting expense and a 4% net increase in personnel expense compared to the prior year period in connection with the expansion of our operations. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, across all departments, we had average full-time equivalent employees of 51 and 44, respectively.\n\u25cf\nOffice and facilities expense increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in leased office space commencing in June 2018 in connection with the expansion of our SLG.TV studio operations.\n\u25cf\nNoncash stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expense increased 69%, primarily due to certain performance options and warrants previously granted to certain executives, which vested upon the achievement of certain performance-based milestones, pursuant to October 2018 amended employee agreements and/or vesting conditions in the underlying equity grant agreements. Performance targets included the completion of our IPO in February 2019 and other operational performance targets. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 300,000 of performance-based stock options and warrants vested with grant date fair values ranging from $8.28 to $8.50, resulting in noncash stock compensation expense of $2,617,000. The remaining increase also reflects $58,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Framerate, as described at Note 8 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\n \n\u25cf\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 48% due primarily to a decrease in scheduled amortization related to fully depreciated assets with useful lives that expired during fiscal 2019 or prior, and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain networking and related equipment disposed of during fiscal 2019.\n\u25cf\nProfessional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased 12% and 179%, respectively, primarily due to a significant increase in directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with our February 2019 IPO, and an increase in legal, audit and other administrative public company costs.\nOther Income (expense)\nOther income (expense), net, for fiscal year 2019 and 2018, totaling $9,909,000 and $4,467,000, respectively, was primarily comprised of interest expense related to the convertible notes outstanding during the periods presented as follows:\n\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the periods presented primarily relates to the issuance of 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, commencing in February 2018 through August 2018, as described below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Principal and interest as of February 27, 2019, the closing date of the IPO and December 31, 2018 totaled $13,793,000 and $13,606,000, respectively. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35. As of and subsequent to February 27, 2019, we have no debt outstanding. As a result of the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes (defined below) and the application of conversion accounting, the Company recorded an immediate charge to interest expense of $1,384,000, representing the write-off of the unamortized balance of debt discounts associated with the 2018 warrants and cash commissions and warrants issued to third parties. Unamortized debt discounts at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,684,000, respectively.\nThe non-detachable conversion feature embedded in the 2018 Notes provides for a conversion rate that was below market value at the commitment date, and therefore, represented a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF\u201d). The BCF is generally recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the debt proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of the BCF to additional paid-in capital. The resulting convertible debt discount is recognized as interest expense using the effective yield method. However, the conversion feature associated with the 2018 Notes was not exercisable until the consummation of an initial public offering by the Company of its common stock, and therefore, was not required to be recognized in earnings until the IPO related contingency was resolved, which occurred on the IPO Closing Date. The commitment date is the IPO Closing Date and the commitment date stock price was $11.00 per share. The intrinsic value of the BCF on the IPO Closing Date, which was limited to the net proceeds allocated to the debt on a relative fair value basis, was approximately $7,067,000, and is reflected as additional interest expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had working capital of approximately $8.7 million and ($8.0) million, respectively, and sustained cumulative losses since inception attributable to common stockholders of approximately $85.8 million. Total noncash charges included in accumulated deficit since inception, primarily related to noncash stock compensation, restricted stock units issued in connection with a license agreement, amortization of the discount on the 2018 Notes (defined below) and in-kind advertising expense, totaled approximately $34.6 million. On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000. During Fiscal 2018, the Company issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, as described below, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $13,000,000. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock as described below. Approximately 1.3 million of the warrants issued in conjunction with the 2018 Notes are callable at the election of the Company at any time following the completion of our IPO.\nTo date, our principal sources of capital used to fund our operations have been the net proceeds we received from sales of equity securities and proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt, as described herein. We have and will continue to use significant capital for the growth and development of our business. Our management team expects operating losses to continue in the near term in connection with the pursuit of our strategic objectives. As such, we believe our current cash position, absent receipt of additional capital either from operations or that may be available from future issuance(s) of common stock or debt financings, is not sufficient to fund our planned operations for the twelve months following the date of this Report. We believe these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1A of this Report.\nWe are focused on expanding our service offerings and revenue growth opportunities through internal development, collaborations, and through one or more strategic acquisitions. Management is currently exploring several alternatives for raising capital to facilitate our growth and execute our business strategy, including strategic partnerships or other forms of equity or debt financings.\nWe continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. To finance such strategic acquisitions, we may find it necessary to raise additional equity capital, incur additional debt, or both. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption periodically and such volatility and disruption may occur in the future. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans which, in turn, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nCash Flows for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes the change in cash balances for the periods presented:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was $13,646,000, which primarily reflected our net GAAP loss of $30,679,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net GAAP loss to net cash used in operating activities of $17,033,000, which included $6,217,000 of noncash stock compensation charges, $2,871,000 of noncash accrued interest and accretion of debt discount, $7,067,0000 of noncash interest expense related to the recognition of the beneficial conversion feature upon the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes upon close of the IPO, and depreciation and amortization of $862,000. Changes in working capital primarily reflected the impact of the prepayment of increased directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with the consummation of our IPO and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2018 was $10,680,000, which primarily reflected our net loss of $20,627,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities of $9,947,000, which included $3,942,000 of non-cash stock compensation, noncash amortization of prepaid in-kind advertising totaling $667,000 and $1,106,000 of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges. Changes in working capital primarily reflected increases in receivables and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course of business during the period.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash flows from investing activities were comprised of the following for the periods presented:\n\nAcquisition of Framerate, Inc. On June 3, 2019, the Company and Merger Sub, entered into the Merger Agreement with Framerate, pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation. The Acquisition was consummated on the Effective Date when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $7.4395, which price was equal to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over the five trading days preceding the date of the Merger Agreement, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. One-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit. On September 23, 2019, the Company and ggCircuit entered into an Expanded Agreement pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer facing brand within ggCircuit's B2B gaming center software platform. In consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League, Super League paid an upfront fee of $340,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The upfront fee is included as \"Licenses\" in intangible assets and other assets, net, in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nCapitalized Internal Use Software Costs. Software development costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Software development costs incurred during the preliminary stages of development are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and training costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upgrades or enhancements to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable estimated useful life.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash flows from financing activities were comprised of the following for the periods presented:\n\nInitial Public Offering. On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,00. The net proceeds received from the offering have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have, and may in the future, use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may compliment or business and or accelerate or growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nPursuant to the related underwriting agreement, in connection with the completion of the IPO, for the purchase price of $50.00, we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 3.0% of the shares sold in the IPO, or 68,182 shares, at an exercise price of $11.00 per share (the Underwriters' Warrants\u201d). The Underwriters' Warrants are exercisable during the period commencing from the date of the close of the IPO and ending five years from the closing date of the IPO. The Underwriters' Warrants represent additional noncash offering costs, with an estimated grant date fair value of $547,000, which was reflected in additional-paid-in capital when issued and as a corresponding offering cost in the statement of shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nConvertible Debt Issuances. In February and April 2018, we issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $3,000,000 (the Initial 2018 Notes\u201d). The Initial 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the close of a $15,000,000 equity financing ( Qualifying Equity Financing\u201d) by us, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into equity or equity-linked securities sold in a Qualifying Equity Financing based upon a conversion rate equal to (x) a 10% discount to the price per share of a Qualifying Equity Financing, with (y) a floor of $10.80 per share. In addition, the holders of the Initial 2018 Notes were collectively issued warrants to purchase approximately 55,559 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.80 per share and a term of five years (the Initial 2018 Warrants\u201d).\nIn May through August 2018, we issued additional 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $10,000,000 (the Additional 2018 Notes\u201d). In May 2018, all of the Initial 2018 Notes and related accrued interest, totaling $3,056,182, were converted into the Additional 2018 Notes, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of $13,056,182 (hereinafter collectively, the 2018 Notes\u201d). The holders of the converted Initial 2018 Notes retained their respective Initial 2018 Warrants.\nThe 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of the closing of an IPO of our common stock on a national securities exchange or April 30, 2019, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into shares of common stock upon the closing of the IPO at the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the price per share of the IPO.

The 2018 Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years, commencing on the close of the IPO, at an exercise price equal to the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the IPO price per share and are callable at our election at any time following the closing of an IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35. As of December 31, 2019, there is no debt outstanding. Refer to Note 6 to the accompany financial statements elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, except as described below, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures, nor do we have any committed lines of credit, noncancelable operating leases obligations, other committed funding or long-term debt, and no guarantees. The operating lease for our corporate headquarters expired on May 31, 2017 and was subsequently amended to operate on a month-to-month basis.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League in connection with the Expanded Agreement described above, including the right to commercially exploit Super League Prime and to feature the Super League Gaming\u201d brand on the applicable ggCircuit customer platform, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, Super League will pay quarterly fees over the term of the Expanded Agreement ranging from $0 to $150,000, based on contractual revenue levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder's equity or that are not reflected in our financial statements included elsewhere herein. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRelaxed Ongoing Reporting Requirements\nUpon the completion of our IPO, we elected to report as an emerging growth company\u201d (as defined in the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations together with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, whose actual outcomes involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those stated in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Report.\nGeneral\nSuper League Gaming, Inc. ( Super League,\u201d the Company,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d) is a global leader in the mission to bring live and digital esports entertainment and experiences directly to everyday competitive gamers around the world. Utilizing our proprietary technology platform, Super League operates physical and digital experiences in partnership with publishers of top-tier game titles and owners/operators of a distributed footprint of venues, a network of digital social and viewing channels, and an association/organization of city-based amateur gaming clubs and teams. In addition to providing premium experiences by operating city-vs-city amateur esports leagues and producing thousands of social gaming experiences across North America and our ever-expanding international footprint, the Super League Network features multiple forms of content celebrating the love of play via social media, live streaming and video-on-demand, along with continuous gameplay and leaderboards. Inside our network is Framerate, a large independent social video esports network powered by user-generated highlight reels, and our exclusive proprietary platform Minehut, providing a social and gameplay forum for the avid Minecraft community. Through our partnerships with high-profile venue owners such as Wanda Theatres in China, and Topgolf and Cinemark Theatres in North America, along with ggCircuit, an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and access to a global network of gaming centers, Super League is committed to supporting the development of local, grassroots player communities, while providing a global, scalable infrastructure for esports competition and engagement. We address not only a wide range of gamers across game titles, ages and skill levels, but also a wide range of content-capture beyond just gameplay. This positions Super League as more than a tournament operator; we are a lifestyle and media company focused on capturing, generating, aggregating and distributing content across the genre of all things esports.\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe Super League is on the leading edge of the rapidly growing competitive video gaming industry, which has become an established and vital part of the entertainment landscape. According to Reuters Plus, 2018, gaming is now the world's favorite form of entertainment, as the gaming industry generated more revenue in 2017 than television, movies and music. At the professional level, thousands of professional players on hundreds of teams compete in dozens of high stakes competitions that draw significant audiences, both in person and online. In addition, the value of brand sponsorships, media rights and prize money continue to rise, as are professional team valuations and the purchase price for securing franchises in professional leagues.\nWith NewZoo reporting 2.6 billion gamers globally, we believe there is a larger opportunity for the world of mainstream competitive players who want their own esports experience. These amateur gamers are players who enjoy the competition, the social interaction and community, and the entertainment value associated with playing and watching others play. According to Nielsen Esports Playbook, 2017, competitive amateur gamers take part in over eight hours of gameplay and watch up to nine hours of esports-related content each week. We believe this is an under-served market that seeks their own opportunities for team-based play on real playing fields.\nSuper League is a critically important component in providing the infrastructure for mainstream esports that is synergistic and accretive to the greater esports ecosystem. Over the past five years, we believe we have become the preeminent brand for amateur esports by providing a proprietary software platform that allows our gamers to compete, socialize and spectate premium amateur esports gameplay and entertainment, both physically and digitally. We celebrate everyday competitive gamers and provide a differentiated way for players and spectators to unite around their city clubs and hometown venues for a better, more inclusive social experience not previously available. Not only do we offer premium amateur esports leagues and community, but we are able to leverage our derivative gameplay content to become a comprehensive amateur esports content network. As we expand our city clubs, partner venue network, breadth of game titles and reach into the home, we bring new players into our customer funnel to drive audience growth, and ultimately, consumer and content monetization.\nIn fiscal year 2019, management focused on the acceleration of development of the building blocks in place for our two primary revenue sources: (1) sponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content, and (2) direct to consumer revenues, or gamer monetization. Further, as detailed below, we further de-risked the business, achieving game title fluidity, venue diversity, and an enhanced and more scalable technology platform. We also established a premium advertising model for future monetization and expanded our sales team to facilitate delivery, launched our first effort at meaningful consumer monetization, and expanded globally, both digitally and physically.\nWe offer a variety of ways gamers can engage digitally across our Super League content network and our network of hometown venues serving as the playing fields for recreational esports. In the first quarter of 2020, we expanded our city-based gaming club and league system from 16 to 24 cities across North America, including Canada and Mexico, and we expect further expansion beyond North America in the future.\nThe fundamental drivers of our business model and monetization strategy are creating deep community engagement through our highly contextualized, local experiences that, when coupled with the critical mass of our large digital audiences, provides the depth and volume for premium content and offer monetization differentiated from a more traditional, commoditized advertising model. The combination of our physical venue network and digital programming channels, with Super League's technology platform at the hub, creates the opportunity for not just a share of the player's wallet, but also the advertiser's wallet. We do this by offering brand sponsors and advertisers a premium marketing channel to reach elusive Generation Z and Millennial gamers and offering players ways to access exclusive tournaments, rewards and programming through our Super League consumer subscription offer and other consumer offerings.\nSponsorships and advertising revenues, the monetization of our content. Traditionally, we have created our own gameplay experiences to generate audience and content and attracted brand and sponsorship dollars to those offers. This continues to be a core source of revenue.\n Our potential partners also include game publishers, retailers and brands across various categories who engage us to develop their own customized branded gameplay experiences, powered by our flexible gaming and content technology platform for their own customers. \n Additionally, we can monetize our content commercially through advertising revenues on our own digital channels and by selling our content to third-parties. \nDirect to Consumer - Gamer monetization. The second way we monetize content is through direct-to-consumer pay walls for access to premium digital and physical experiences and viewing content. We have historically offered a freemium model where consumers can join Super League for free-to-play, casual competitive experiences and charged for access to premium gameplay experiences. We intend to expand our breadth of consumer digital offers in 2020.\n \nTo date, our revenues have been weighted towards experience monetization, however we expect to see content monetization begin to emerge as a revenue opportunity.\nKey Performance Indicators. We focus on five key performance indicators ( KPIs\u201d), as outlined below, to assess our progress and drive revenue growth. The number of game titles and number of retail partner venues drive audience, introducing more players and spectators to Super League's gaming and content platform. Growth in physical and digital experiences across a wider portfolio can increase the number of registered users, including subscribers, and number of gameplay hours which will have a significant impact on our content library. This focus on audience and content generation ultimately impacts our viewership, which has an amplification effect on potential revenue streams and customer acquisition.\nWe significantly outperformed the KPI goals we established at the beginning of 2019, setting us up for fiscal 2020 with a focus on accelerated revenue growth. During 2019, we achieved the following KPI related results:\n \u25cf Game titles: We ended fiscal 2018 with four game titles in our portfolio and as of the end of fiscal 2019, had over 20 game titles, including the addition of Capcom's Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition during the second quarter of 2019 and Tencent America's Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile ( PUBG Mobile\u201d), during the third quarter of 2019. The increase in game titles reflects the flexibility of our technology platform and our platform's ability to rapidly ingest game titles across a wide spectrum of game genres. Further, our digital content network, which features user-generated content submitted to us from any gamer, anywhere, has a limitless library of featured titles. The diversity of our portfolio differentiates us as a truly game-agnostic platform speaking to a wide spectrum of players and viewers. \n \u25cf Retail Partner Venues: While we are just seeding the build out and monetization of our retail footprint, our national-level announcements with Top golf and ggCircuit LAN centers, as well as our expanded agreement with ggCircuit, which allows us to expand internationally, provides us with access to hundreds of physical venue locations. We ended fiscal 2018 with 46 active venues and grew to over 500 total active venues as of December 31, 2019. Our domestic and global footprint establishes us as a leader in aggregating local esports fields for everyday competitive gamers. \n \u25cf Registered Users: We ended fiscal 2018 with approximately 300,000 registered users. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our registered users by approximately 227%, to 980,000 registered users. This increase in registered users represents more gamers from whom we can gather user generated content and convert into subscribers and/or upsell into other paid offers. \n \u25cf Gameplay Hours: As of December 31, 2019, including our live gaming experiences and our expanding digital gameplay channels, we generated approximately 15.0 million hours of gameplay experiences, as compared to approximately 1.8 million full year 2018 gameplay hours. We are just beginning to explore the ways we can repackage and distribute this significant derivative content library for further monetization. \n \u25cf Viewership: Proving that we can attract viewers to our platform and leverage the audiences our brand partners provide, we generated 120.0 million views during fiscal year 2019, compared to our full-year 2018 views of 925,000, leveraging our own programming and experiences and the significant expansion of our audience reach in connection with the acquisition of Framerate. The increase in views resulted in the exponential growth of our monetizable advertising inventory. Additionally, our increase in views was achieved largely via user generated content submitted to us by our community, significantly limiting the production cost and overall investment required to achieve the growth in viewership in 2019. \nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000.\nThe principal purposes of the IPO were to obtain additional capital to support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We have and continue to use the net proceeds received from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have and may continue to use a portion of the net proceeds for the strategic acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may complement our business and or accelerate our growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the underlying agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35.\nAcquisition of Framerate, Inc.\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company and SLG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with Framerate, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Framerate\u201d), pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation (the Acquisition\u201d).\nFramerate is a cross-platform esports social video network delivering the best in gameplay highlights, news and entertainment to today's generation of video gamers. The company's focus on user generated content and social distribution changes the way traditional esports video content is produced, distributed and shared by millions of esports fans worldwide. The acquisition of Framerate represents a strategic step in our audience-building efforts with an average of 15 million video views a month during the second half of 2019, built around everyday gamers uploading their personal esports highlight reels for recognition across our wide audience.\nThe Acquisition was consummated on June 6, 2019 when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Effective Date\u201d). As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock at a price per share of $7.4395 (the Closing Shares\u201d).\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares (the Earn-Out Shares\u201d) in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. Upon achievement of the applicable performance-based milestones, if any, one-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nThe Acquisition was approved by the board of directors of each of Super League Gaming, Inc. and Framerate, and was approved by the stockholders of Framerate. Refer to Note 5 to our financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information about the Acquisition.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit, LLC\nOn September 23, 2019, Super League and ggCircuit, LLC ( ggCircuit\u201d), an esports services company that provides gaming center management software solutions and other esports offerings, entered into an expanded commercial partnership agreement ( Expanded Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer-facing brand within ggCircuit's leading gaming center software platform, known as ggLeap.\u201d Under the terms of the Expanded Agreement, commencing with the November 2019 ggLeap software update release, the consumer facing components of ggLeap, including its leaderboards, its competitive seasons and its local loyalty programs, were rebranded as Super League Gaming,\u201d and are managed by Super League. ggLeap is a B2B software platform and B2C application created and owned by ggCircuit. ggLeap is licensed and distributed to owners and operators of video gaming centers throughout the world. It helps gaming centers manage the PCs in their venue, administer loyalty programs for local players, and provides the interface and local operating system through which players log into computers and launch all of their gameplay sessions within the gaming centers where ggLeap is deployed. The December 2019 software release included, the pilot launch of a consumer subscription offer, Super League Prime,\u201d through which players in gaming centers will be able to access special member benefits along with an underpinning global loyalty program for all in players to earn points and prizing for local rewards.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League, including the right to commercially exploit Super League Prime and to feature the Super League Gaming\u201d brand on the applicable ggCircuit customer platform, Super League paid an upfront fee of $340,000 and, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, will pay quarterly fees over the term of the Expanded Agreement ranging from $0 to $150,000, based on contractual revenue levels. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Expanded Agreement, revenues generated in connection with applicable activities under the Expanded Agreement will be shared between Super League and ggCircuit based on contractual revenue sharing percentages. The initial term of the Expanded Agreement commences on the effective date and concludes on the fifth anniversary of the effective date, subject to certain automatic renewal provisions. The upfront fee is included in intangible assets and other, net in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nWanda Cinemas Games Partnership\nIn January 2020, we announced a new partnership with Wanda Cinemas Games, a subsidiary of Chinese media conglomerate Wanda Media. The new alliance will initially bring live, competitive gaming experiences to Wanda's 700+ owned and operated theaters in multiple cities across China, with more activations to be announced in the future. This new venture provides Super League with the opportunity to greatly expand our reach into the world's largest market of 1.2 billion gamers, more than the entire population of the United States.\nIn the agreement, Wanda theatres will be transformed into esports venues hosting live Super League events and tournaments throughout China, driving an entirely new gaming experience for the massive Wanda customer base. Passionate players will see their local movie theatre serve as a competitive and social playing field for the video games they love. The unique gaming experiences created by Super League will propel Wanda venues to the center of the global esports phenomena. The partnership will continue to fuel Super League's focus on the vast opportunity to monetize gamers and the content they generate.\nPrime Subscription Offer\nIn December 2019, we launched in beta Super League Prime, our consumer subscription offer, in North America, with an international launch scheduled for 2020. Super League Prime is a subscription offer that recognizes and rewards players, both locally and globally, through ggCircuit-enabled gaming centers. Players can earn rewards for both the length and quality of their gameplay and gain exposure on national and local leaderboards. All participating players can earn a basic level of loyalty points for prizing redemption locally in-venue. Players who upgrade to our paid monthly subscription offer enjoy additional benefits including the ability to earn points faster, access to exclusive competitions and the Super League global prize vault, and added benefits from our brand sponsors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in the audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following accounting policies were identified during the periods presented, based on activities occurring during the periods presented, as critical and requiring significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In this regard, revenue is recognized when: (i) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (ii) we can identify each party's rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; (iii) we can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; (iv) the contract has commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the entity's future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and (v) it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nSuper League generates revenues and related cash flows from (i) brand and media sponsorships, (ii) Platform-As-A-Service arrangements, (iii) advertising and third-party content and (iv) direct to consumer offers including tournament fees for participation in our physical and online multiplayer gaming experiences, digital subscriptions and merchandise sales.\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. We generate brand and media sponsorship revenues primarily from sales of various forms of sponsorships and promotional campaigns for our online platforms and from sponsorship at our in-person esports experiences. Brand and media sponsorship revenue arrangements may include: exclusive or non-exclusive title sponsorships, marketing benefits, official product status exclusivity, product visibly and additional infrastructure placement, social media rights (including rights to create and post social content and clips), rights to on-screen activations and promotions, display material rights, media rights, hospitality and tickets and merchandising rights. Brand and media sponsorship arrangements typically include contract terms for time periods ranging from several weeks to multi-year arrangements.\nFor brand and media sponsorship arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate platform-as-a-service ( PaaS\u201d) revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to run amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform.\nRevenue for PaaS arrangements for one-off branded experiences and/or the development of content tailored specifically for our partners' distribution channels that provide for a contractual delivery or performance date, is recognized when performance is substantially complete and or delivery occurs. Revenue for PaaS arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time whereby customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligations over the applicable contract term, is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nAdvertising and Third-Party Content Revenue. We generate content through digital and physical experiences that offer opportunities for generating advertising revenue on our proprietary digital channels. In addition, we license our content to third parties seeking esports content for their own distribution channels.\nFor advertising and third-party content arrangements that include performance obligations satisfied over time, customers typically simultaneously receive and consume the benefits under the arrangement as we satisfy our performance obligations, over the applicable contract term. As such, revenue is recognized over the contract term based upon estimates of progress toward complete satisfaction of the contract performance obligations (typically utilizing a time, effort or delivery-based method of estimation).\nDirect to Consumer Revenue. Direct to consumer revenues include tournament fees, digital subscriptions and merchandise. Direct to consumer revenues have primarily consisted of the sale of season passes to gamers for participation in our in-person and or online multiplayer gaming experiences. For the periods presented herein, season passes for gaming experiences were comprised of multi-week packages and one-time, single experience admissions. Digital subscription revenues include revenues related to our Minehut asset acquisition in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community, and Super League Prime subscription offer which was launched in beta in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenue from single experiences is recognized when the experience occurs. Revenue from multi-week packages is recognized over time as the multi-week experiences occur based on estimates of the progress toward complete satisfaction of the applicable offer and related performance obligations. Subscription revenue is recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe make estimates and judgments when determining whether the collectability of accounts receivable is reasonably assured. We assess the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the credit-worthiness of our customers. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured, amounts due are recognized when collectability becomes reasonably assured, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, which is generally upon receipt of cash for transactions where collectability may have been an issue. Management's estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenues recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenues. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events and thus materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nDepending on the complexity of the underlying revenue arrangement and related terms and conditions, significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required to determine each parties rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, each parties performance obligations, whether performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time, the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and the appropriate period or periods in which, or during which, the completion of the earnings process occurs. Depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements, if different judgments, assumptions and estimates are made regarding revenue arrangements in any specific period, our periodic financial results may be materially affected.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nCompensation expense for stock-based awards is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, typically on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity award), which is generally two to four years. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions that affect vesting is recorded only for those awards expected to vest or when the performance criteria are met. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is determined by the product of the number of shares or units granted and the grant date market price of the underlying common stock. The fair value of stock option and common stock purchase warrant awards is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures of awards as they occur.\nGrants of equity-based awards (including warrants) to non-employees in exchange for consulting or other services are accounted for using the fair value of the consideration received (i.e., the value of the goods or services) or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments, including estimating the market price volatility of our common stock, determination of grant dates, future employee stock option exercise behavior and requisite service periods.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nIn connection with the application of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Framerate, as described above, we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. In the context of purchase accounting, the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments and estimates by management, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimated fair values reflected in the purchase accounting rely on management's judgment and the expertise of a third-party valuation firm engaged to assist in concluding on the fair value measurements.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nREVENUES\n</td> <td> $1,084,000\n</td> <td> $1,046,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCOST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td> 513,000\n</td> <td> 684,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td> 571,000\n</td> <td> 362,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, marketing and advertising\n</td> <td> 4,488,000\n</td> <td> 4,319,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology platform and infrastructure\n</td> <td> 4,520,000\n</td> <td> 4,183,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> 12,333,000\n</td> <td> 8,020,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> 21,341,000\n</td> <td> 16,522,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td> (20,770,000)\n</td> <td> (16,160,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n</td> <td> (9,909,000)\n</td> <td> (4,467,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNET LOSS\n</td> <td> $(30,679,000)\n</td> <td> $(20,627,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2019 and\nRevenue\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brand and Media Sponsorships\n</td> <td> $451,000\n</td> <td> $549,000\n</td> <td> $(98,000)\n</td> <td> (18)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Platform-as-a-service\n</td> <td> 532,000\n</td> <td> 291,000\n</td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> 83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and content sales\n</td> <td> 68,000\n</td> <td> 69,000\n</td> <td> (1,000)\n</td> <td> (1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct to Consumer\n</td> <td> 33,000\n</td> <td> 137,000\n</td> <td> (104,000)\n</td> <td> (76)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $1,084,000\n</td> <td> $1,046,000\n</td> <td> $38,000\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue for fiscal year 2019 increased $38,000, or 4%, compared to fiscal year 2018. Revenues for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nSponsorships and Advertising:\n\u25cf\nBrand and Media Sponsorships. Period to period changes in brand and media sponsorship revenues are attributable to fluctuations in brand and media sponsorship activities period to period, which is based on the specific partnership arrangements with activities during a particular period, the related performance obligations satisfied during the period and the contractual consideration associated with the activities during the period. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues for our Red Bull North America, Inc. ( Red Bull\u201d) brand partnership, Red Bull Allstars experience in April 2019, Logitech G Challenge and Play/Train/Win online tournaments, Sony related build competitions and related experiences and our Red Games Lego Brawls live stream sponsorship activation. Brand and media sponsorship revenues for fiscal year 2018 was primarily comprised of revenues from our Logitech, Inc. and Red Bull brand sponsorships and our 2018 Red Bull Allstars experience.\n\u25cf\nPlatform-As-A-Service. We generate PaaS revenues pursuant to arrangements with brand and media partners, retail venues, game publishers and broadcasters that allow our partners to hold amateur esports experiences, and or capture specifically curated gameplay content that is customized for our partners' distribution channels, leveraging the flexibility of, and powered by our Super League gaming and content technology platform. PaaS revenue for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from our Samsung Fortnite event held in New York in March 2019, Capcom, Inc. related to our Street Fighter\u00ae V: Arcade Edition partnership, Sony related to certain build competitions and related experiences, Sprint related to our Sprint 5G LA activation, our Cox Paladins gameplay experience and our Tencent Games and OnePlus Mobile Player Unknown's Battlegrounds Mobile, or PUBG Mobile, premium content, competitive experiences and sponsorship activation.\n\u25cf\nAdvertising and Content Sales. Revenues for fiscal year 2019 included revenues from campaigns launched related to our Framerate acquisition and advertising revenues from Snapchat related content sales and our Minehut digital property. Revenues for fiscal year 2018 included revenues from the sale of gameplay and other content generated by us to Nickelodeon (third-party broadcaster) to supplement their YouTube channel programming. We expect to continue to expand our advertising revenue and revenue from the sale of our proprietary and third-party content derived from our technology platform in future periods, as we expand our advertising inventory, viewership and related sales activities.\nDirect to Consumer:\n\u25cf\nThe decrease in direct to consumer revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of paid events held during fiscal year 2019, as compared to the prior year period. During fiscal year 2019, we held paid events and a higher number of events that were free to play, consistent with our strategic focus on increasing the volume of new gamers and spectators introduced into our customer funnel, to increase the number of registered users on our platform, drive consumer conversion, and increase the overall awareness of the Super League brand and technology platform offerings. We intend to continue to offer a combination of paid and free to play experiences going forward. Digital subscription revenues included in direct to consumer revenues for fiscal year 2019 were primarily comprised of subscription revenues related to our Minehut digital property acquired in June 2018, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis to the Minecraft gaming community.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> $513,000\n</td> <td> $684,000\n</td> <td> $(171,000)\n</td> <td> 25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2019 decreased $171,000 or 25% compared to fiscal year 2018, as compared to a 4% increase in revenues for the same periods. The trend in cost of sales for the periods presented was primarily due to operational efficiencies and lower direct costs incurred for fiscal year 2019 in connection with our physical and digital experiences.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, Marketing and Advertising\n</td> <td> $4,488,000\n</td> <td> $4,319,000\n</td> <td> $169,000\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology Platform and Infrastructure\n</td> <td> 4,520,000\n</td> <td> 4,183,000\n</td> <td> 337,000\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> 12,333,000\n</td> <td> 8,020,000\n</td> <td> 4,313,000\n</td> <td> 54%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> $21,341,000\n</td> <td> $16,522,000\n</td> <td> $4,819,000\n</td> <td> 29%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, Marketing and Advertising. The increase in selling, marketing and advertising expense was primarily due to a 27% increase in personnel costs associated with the continued expansion of our operations requiring additional internal resources across our product, creative and commercial departments, and an increase in marketing and promotional experiences focused on widening our customer funnel and attracting increased numbers of registered users to our platform. The increase included increased costs related to contract labor, influencers, event operations, content capture and other costs to execute various marketing and promotional experiences during the period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of noncash in-kind advertising costs, totaling $667,000, which were initially capitalized pursuant to a June 2017 third-party investment agreement. The investment agreement included in-kind advertising for use in future periods, valued at $1.0 million, as a component of the consideration paid to us in exchange for equity in the Company. The prepaid advertising cost was amortized over an 18-month period ending as of December 31, 2018.\nTechnology Platform and Infrastructure. Technology platform and infrastructure costs include (i) allocated personnel costs, including salaries, noncash stock compensation, taxes and benefits related to our internal software developers and engineers, employed by Super League, engaged in the operation, maintenance, management, administration, testing, development and enhancement of our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (ii) third-party contract software development and engineering resources engaged in developing and enhancing our proprietary gaming and content technology platform, (iii) the amortization of capitalized internal use software costs, and (iv) technology platform related cloud services and broadband costs. Capitalized internal use software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life. The period over period increase primarily reflects an increase in engineering headcount since the end of the prior year in connection with the expansion of our engineering and internal use software development activities and an increase in technology platform related cloud services costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense for the periods presented was comprised of the following:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td> $2,755,000\n</td> <td> $1,902,000\n</td> <td> $853,000\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office and facilities\n</td> <td> 403,000\n</td> <td> 367,000\n</td> <td> 36,000\n</td> <td> 10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> 911,000\n</td> <td> 816,000\n</td> <td> 95,000\n</td> <td> 12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> 5,453,000\n</td> <td> 3,236,000\n</td> <td> 2,217,000\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 445,000\n</td> <td> 851,000\n</td> <td> (406,000)\n</td> <td> (-48)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> 2,366,000\n</td> <td> 848,000\n</td> <td> 1,518,000\n</td> <td> 179%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expense\n</td> <td> $12,333,000\n</td> <td> $8,020,000\n</td> <td> $4,313,000\n</td> <td> 54%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA summary of the main drivers of the net increase in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented is as follows:\n\u25cf\nGeneral and administrative personnel costs increased 45%, primarily due to approximately $455,000 of management performance-based bonuses paid in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based milestones during fiscal year 2019, including the closing of the IPO and other operational performance targets. The increase in personnel costs also reflects an increase in recruiting expense and a 4% net increase in personnel expense compared to the prior year period in connection with the expansion of our operations. During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, across all departments, we had average full-time equivalent employees of 51 and 44, respectively.\n\u25cf\nOffice and facilities expense increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in leased office space commencing in June 2018 in connection with the expansion of our SLG.TV studio operations.\n\u25cf\nNoncash stock compensation expense included in general and administrative expense increased 69%, primarily due to certain performance options and warrants previously granted to certain executives, which vested upon the achievement of certain performance-based milestones, pursuant to October 2018 amended employee agreements and/or vesting conditions in the underlying equity grant agreements. Performance targets included the completion of our IPO in February 2019 and other operational performance targets. During fiscal year 2019, approximately 300,000 of performance-based stock options and warrants vested with grant date fair values ranging from $8.28 to $8.50, resulting in noncash stock compensation expense of $2,617,000. The remaining increase also reflects $58,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Framerate, as described at Note 8 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\n \n\u25cf\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 48% due primarily to a decrease in scheduled amortization related to fully depreciated assets with useful lives that expired during fiscal 2019 or prior, and the acceleration of depreciation related to certain networking and related equipment disposed of during fiscal 2019.\n\u25cf\nProfessional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased 12% and 179%, respectively, primarily due to a significant increase in directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with our February 2019 IPO, and an increase in legal, audit and other administrative public company costs.\nOther Income (expense)\nOther income (expense), net, for fiscal year 2019 and 2018, totaling $9,909,000 and $4,467,000, respectively, was primarily comprised of interest expense related to the convertible notes outstanding during the periods presented as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount on convertible notes\n</td> <td> $2,475,000\n</td> <td> $1,394,000\n</td> <td> 1,081,000\n</td> <td> 78%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued interest expense on convertible notes\n</td> <td> 187,000\n</td> <td> 311,000\n</td> <td> (124,000)\n</td> <td> (40)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of convertible note issuance costs\n</td> <td> 209,000\n</td> <td> 143,000\n</td> <td> 66,000\n</td> <td> 46%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td> 7,067,000\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 7,067,000\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td> $9,938,000\n</td> <td> $1,848,000\n</td> <td> $8,090,000\n</td> <td>\n>300%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the periods presented primarily relates to the issuance of 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, commencing in February 2018 through August 2018, as described below under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Principal and interest as of February 27, 2019, the closing date of the IPO and December 31, 2018 totaled $13,793,000 and $13,606,000, respectively. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35. As of and subsequent to February 27, 2019, we have no debt outstanding. As a result of the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes (defined below) and the application of conversion accounting, the Company recorded an immediate charge to interest expense of $1,384,000, representing the write-off of the unamortized balance of debt discounts associated with the 2018 warrants and cash commissions and warrants issued to third parties. Unamortized debt discounts at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,684,000, respectively.\nThe non-detachable conversion feature embedded in the 2018 Notes provides for a conversion rate that was below market value at the commitment date, and therefore, represented a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF\u201d). The BCF is generally recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the debt proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of the BCF to additional paid-in capital. The resulting convertible debt discount is recognized as interest expense using the effective yield method. However, the conversion feature associated with the 2018 Notes was not exercisable until the consummation of an initial public offering by the Company of its common stock, and therefore, was not required to be recognized in earnings until the IPO related contingency was resolved, which occurred on the IPO Closing Date. The commitment date is the IPO Closing Date and the commitment date stock price was $11.00 per share. The intrinsic value of the BCF on the IPO Closing Date, which was limited to the net proceeds allocated to the debt on a relative fair value basis, was approximately $7,067,000, and is reflected as additional interest expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had working capital of approximately $8.7 million and ($8.0) million, respectively, and sustained cumulative losses since inception attributable to common stockholders of approximately $85.8 million. Total noncash charges included in accumulated deficit since inception, primarily related to noncash stock compensation, restricted stock units issued in connection with a license agreement, amortization of the discount on the 2018 Notes (defined below) and in-kind advertising expense, totaled approximately $34.6 million. On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2019 (File No. 333-229144). We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,000. During Fiscal 2018, the Company issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes, as described below, in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $13,000,000. Concurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding was automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock as described below. Approximately 1.3 million of the warrants issued in conjunction with the 2018 Notes are callable at the election of the Company at any time following the completion of our IPO.\nTo date, our principal sources of capital used to fund our operations have been the net proceeds we received from sales of equity securities and proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt, as described herein. We have and will continue to use significant capital for the growth and development of our business. Our management team expects operating losses to continue in the near term in connection with the pursuit of our strategic objectives. As such, we believe our current cash position, absent receipt of additional capital either from operations or that may be available from future issuance(s) of common stock or debt financings, is not sufficient to fund our planned operations for the twelve months following the date of this Report. We believe these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1A of this Report.\nWe are focused on expanding our service offerings and revenue growth opportunities through internal development, collaborations, and through one or more strategic acquisitions. Management is currently exploring several alternatives for raising capital to facilitate our growth and execute our business strategy, including strategic partnerships or other forms of equity or debt financings.\nWe continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions. To finance such strategic acquisitions, we may find it necessary to raise additional equity capital, incur additional debt, or both. Any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through issuances of equity or debt, or other external financing. However, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption periodically and such volatility and disruption may occur in the future. If we fail to obtain additional financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans which, in turn, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nCash Flows for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes the change in cash balances for the periods presented:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> $(13,646,000)\n</td> <td> $(10,680,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> (3,164,000)\n</td> <td> (866,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> 22,478,000\n</td> <td> 12,611,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash\n</td> <td> 5,668,000\n</td> <td> 1,065,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, at beginning of period\n</td> <td> 2,774,000\n</td> <td> 1,709,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, at end of period\n</td> <td> $8,442,000\n</td> <td> $2,774,000\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was $13,646,000, which primarily reflected our net GAAP loss of $30,679,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net GAAP loss to net cash used in operating activities of $17,033,000, which included $6,217,000 of noncash stock compensation charges, $2,871,000 of noncash accrued interest and accretion of debt discount, $7,067,0000 of noncash interest expense related to the recognition of the beneficial conversion feature upon the automatic conversion of the 2018 Notes upon close of the IPO, and depreciation and amortization of $862,000. Changes in working capital primarily reflected the impact of the prepayment of increased directors and officer's insurance premiums in connection with the consummation of our IPO and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2018 was $10,680,000, which primarily reflected our net loss of $20,627,000, net of adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities of $9,947,000, which included $3,942,000 of non-cash stock compensation, noncash amortization of prepaid in-kind advertising totaling $667,000 and $1,106,000 of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges. Changes in working capital primarily reflected increases in receivables and the settlement of payables in the ordinary course of business during the period.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities.

On June 3, 2019, the Company and Merger Sub, entered into the Merger Agreement with Framerate, pursuant to which Framerate merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation. The Acquisition was consummated on the Effective Date when the certificate of merger of Merger Sub and Framerate was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. As consideration for the Acquisition, we ratably paid and/or issued to the former shareholders of Framerate an aggregate of $1.5 million in cash and $1.0 million worth of shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $7.4395, which price was equal to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over the five trading days preceding the date of the Merger Agreement, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition to the issuance of the Closing Shares, the Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of up to an additional $980,000 worth of shares of our common stock at the same price per share as the Closing Shares in the event Framerate achieves certain performance-based milestones during the two-year period following the closing of the Acquisition, or June 6, 2021. One-half of the Earn-Out Shares will be issuable on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, and the remaining one-half will be issuable on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\nExpanded Agreement with ggCircuit. On September 23, 2019, the Company and ggCircuit entered into an Expanded Agreement pursuant to which Super League became the primary consumer facing brand within ggCircuit's B2B gaming center software platform. In consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League, Super League paid an upfront fee of $340,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The upfront fee is included as \"Licenses\" in intangible assets and other assets, net, in the accompanying balance sheet and is being amortized over the initial term of the Expanded Agreement of five years, commencing October 1, 2019.\nCapitalized Internal Use Software Costs. Software development costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life, which is generally three years.

On February 27, 2019, we completed our IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. We raised net proceeds of approximately $22,458,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $2,542,00. The net proceeds received from the offering have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product development and capital expenditures. We have, and may in the future, use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that may compliment or business and or accelerate or growth. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, competitive pressures and other factors described under Risk Factors\u201d in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act with the SEC on February 27, 2019, as well as Item I, Part 1A of this Report. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from the IPO.\nPursuant to the related underwriting agreement, in connection with the completion of the IPO, for the purchase price of $50.00, we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 3.0% of the shares sold in the IPO, or 68,182 shares, at an exercise price of $11.00 per share (the Underwriters' Warrants\u201d). The Underwriters' Warrants are exercisable during the period commencing from the date of the close of the IPO and ending five years from the closing date of the IPO. The Underwriters' Warrants represent additional noncash offering costs, with an estimated grant date fair value of $547,000, which was reflected in additional-paid-in capital when issued and as a corresponding offering cost in the statement of shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nConvertible Debt Issuances. In February and April 2018, we issued 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $3,000,000 (the Initial 2018 Notes\u201d). The Initial 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the close of a $15,000,000 equity financing ( Qualifying Equity Financing\u201d) by us, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into equity or equity-linked securities sold in a Qualifying Equity Financing based upon a conversion rate equal to (x) a 10% discount to the price per share of a Qualifying Equity Financing, with (y) a floor of $10.80 per share. In addition, the holders of the Initial 2018 Notes were collectively issued warrants to purchase approximately 55,559 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.80 per share and a term of five years (the Initial 2018 Warrants\u201d).\nIn May through August 2018, we issued additional 9.00% secured convertible promissory notes with a collective face value of $10,000,000 (the Additional 2018 Notes\u201d). In May 2018, all of the Initial 2018 Notes and related accrued interest, totaling $3,056,182, were converted into the Additional 2018 Notes, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of $13,056,182 (hereinafter collectively, the 2018 Notes\u201d). The holders of the converted Initial 2018 Notes retained their respective Initial 2018 Warrants.\nThe 2018 Notes (i) accrued simple interest at the rate of 9.00% per annum, (ii) matured on the earlier of the closing of an IPO of our common stock on a national securities exchange or April 30, 2019, and (iii) all outstanding principal and accrued interest was automatically convertible into shares of common stock upon the closing of the IPO at the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the price per share of the IPO. In addition, the holders of the 2018 Notes were collectively issued 1,396,383 warrants to purchase common stock equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes divided by $9.35 per share (the 2018 Warrants\u201d). The 2018 Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years, commencing on the close of the IPO, at an exercise price equal to the lesser of (x) $10.80 per share or (y) a 15% discount to the IPO price per share and are callable at our election at any time following the closing of an IPO.\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO on February 27, 2019, in accordance with the related agreements, all outstanding principal and interest for the 9.00% convertible notes outstanding, totaling $13,793,000, was automatically converted into 1,475,164 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $9.35.

Refer to Note 6 to the accompany financial statements elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, except as described below, we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures, nor do we have any committed lines of credit, noncancelable operating leases obligations, other committed funding or long-term debt, and no guarantees. The operating lease for our corporate headquarters expired on May 31, 2017 and was subsequently amended to operate on a month-to-month basis.\nIn consideration for the rights granted by ggCircuit to Super League in connection with the Expanded Agreement described above, including the right to commercially exploit Super League Prime and to feature the Super League Gaming\u201d brand on the applicable ggCircuit customer platform, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, Super League will pay quarterly fees over the term of the Expanded Agreement ranging from $0 to $150,000, based on contractual revenue levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder's equity or that are not reflected in our financial statements included elsewhere herein. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRelaxed Ongoing Reporting Requirements\nUpon the completion of our IPO, we elected to report as an emerging growth company\u201d (as defined in the"}
