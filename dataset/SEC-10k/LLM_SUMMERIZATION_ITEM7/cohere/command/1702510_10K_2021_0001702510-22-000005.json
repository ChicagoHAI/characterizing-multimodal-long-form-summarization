Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) within this section is focused on the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, including year-to-year comparisons between these years. Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2020, including year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOVERVIEW\nWe were incorporated on February 10, 2017 as a Maryland corporation with the name Carlyle Private Credit, Inc., and our name was changed to TCG BDC II, Inc. on March 3, 2017. We are structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. We conducted the Initial Private Offering and intend to conduct the New Continuous Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We have an indefinite term.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily by investing in senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies supported by financial sponsors, which we define as companies with approximately $25 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow. This core strategy is supplemented with our complementary specialty lending strategy, which takes advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. Generally, we expect our core strategy and our complementary strategy to be 70-85% and 15-30%, respectively, of the portfolio. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche\u201d loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans\u201d), with a minority of our assets invested in investments that are typically higher yielding than Middle Market Senior Loans (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities).\nWe invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt, if rated, is rated below investment grade, and, if not rated, would likely be rated below investment grade if it were rated (that is, below BBB- or Baa3, which is often referred to as junk\u201d). Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Investments-Our investments are risky and speculative.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both our Investment Adviser and our Administrator are wholly owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of Carlyle. Our Investment Adviser's five-person investment committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the investment committee have experience investing through different credit cycles. As of December 31, 2021, our Investment Adviser's investment team included a team of more than 180 investment professionals across the Carlyle Global Credit segment. Our Investment Adviser's investment committee comprises five of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across asset classes and over 26 years of average industry experience and 10 years of average tenure. In addition, our Investment Adviser and its investment team are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle.\nIn conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates.\nKEY COMPONENTS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under an administration agreement between us and our Administrator; (iii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and (iv) other operating expenses as detailed below:\n\u2022administration fees payable under our Sub-Administration Agreements, including related expenses;\n\u2022the costs of any other offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;\n\u2022calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n\u2022expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser, or members of our Investment Adviser team managing our investments, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, expenses of enforcing our rights;\n\u2022certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;\n\u2022the allocated costs incurred by our Investment Adviser in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;\n\u2022amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;\n\u2022the costs associated with subscriptions to data service, research-related subscriptions and expenses and quotation equipment and services used in making or holding investments;\n\u2022transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022costs of hedging;\n\u2022commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n\u2022federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022any U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including any excise taxes;\n\u2022independent director fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records, costs of preparing tax returns, costs of Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and attestation and costs of filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies), and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation or review of the foregoing;\n\u2022the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n\u2022the costs of specialty and custom software for monitoring risk, compliance and overall portfolio, including any development costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC;\n\u2022our fidelity bond;\n\u2022directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022indemnification payments;\n\u2022direct fees and expenses associated with independent audits, agency, consulting and legal costs; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or our Administrator in connection with administering our business, including our allocable share of certain officers and their staff compensation.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nBelow is a summary of certain characteristics of our

Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at fair value is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at fair value included in such securities. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at amortized cost is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at amortized cost included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.\nTotal weighted average yields (which includes the effect of accretion of discount and amortization of premiums) of our first and second lien debt investments as measured on an amortized cost basis increased from 7.80% to 7.95% from\nDecember 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The increase in weighted average yields was primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that repaid or were sold.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, one and one of our debt investments was on non-accrual status, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 - 5, which ratings are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio.

The size of our portfolio at amortized cost increased to $2,070,975 as of December 31, 2021 from $1,833,385 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt on amortized cost increased to 7.95% from 7.80% as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that were repaid or were sold.\nInterest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan's credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $10,836 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.5% of the total investments at fair value. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2020, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $8,151 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.4% of the total investments at fair value.\nNet investment

The accrual for any\ncapital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. No incentive fees on capital gains have been paid for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the incentive and management fees.\nProfessional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs.

We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in\nportfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our revolving credit facilities and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on October 3, 2017, which was subsequently amended on March 14, 2018, November 16, 2018, May 12, 2020 and October 2, 2020 (as amended, the Subscription Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Facility was $50,000 and is subject to availability under the Subscription Facility, which is based on certain of the Company's unfunded investor equity capital commitments, and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The Subscription Facility has a maturity date of October 3, 2022. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the Subscription Facility bear interest currently at LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 1.95% per year, subject to a 0.50% floor on LIBOR. The Company is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Subscription Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in our equity investors' unfunded capital commitments.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on April 1, 2019 (the SPV Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on October 25, 2019, February 7, 2020 and December 4, 2020, June 2, 2021 and December 28, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the SPV Credit Facility was $700,000 ($600,000 prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment), and is subject to availability under the SPV Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 1, 2025, with one one-year extension option, subject to the SPV's and the lender's consent. The SPV may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate) plus 2.40% per year (2.25% per year with a step-up based on collateral coverage and asset mix prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment). The SPV also pays a fee of between 0.50% and 0.75% per year on undrawn amounts under the SPV Credit Facility. Payments under the SPV Credit Facility are made quarterly. The SPV Credit Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the SPV.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on May 13, 2020 (the SPV2 Credit Facility\u201d, together with the Subscription Facility and SPV Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d), which was subsequently amended on February 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021. The SPV2 Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to a principal amount of $450,000 ($250,000 prior to the February 2021 and August 2021 amendments), subject to availability under the SPV2 Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV2 Credit Facility has a revolving period through May 13, 2023, and a maturity date of May 13, 2028. Borrowings under the SPV2 Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus 2.66% per year (2.95% prior to the February 2021 amendment). SPV2 is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Payments under the SPV2 Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a security interest on substantially all of the assets of SPV2.\nAlthough we believe that we, the SPV and SPV2 will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we, the SPV and SPV2 will continue to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Subscription Facility, the SPV Credit Facility and/or the SPV2 Credit Facility that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the respective facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that we cannot meet our financing obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations.

These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, as well as with our Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e. consensus pricing\u201d). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.\nSecurities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded\ninvestment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management's preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee\u201d) reviews the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.\nAll factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant:\n\u2022the nature and realizable value of any collateral;\n\u2022call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;\n\u2022the portfolio company's leverage and ability to make payments;\n\u2022the portfolio company's public or private credit rating;\n\u2022the portfolio company's actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;\n\u2022prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;\n\u2022the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and\n\u2022comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.\nInvestment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificate received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFor further information on the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on fair value measurements.\nInvestments\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nRevenue Recognition\nNon-Accrual Income\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine not to place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIncome Taxes\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, the Company must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then the Company is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute.\nThe minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require the Company to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income ( ICTI\u201d), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.\nIn addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed.\nThe Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense.\nThe SPV and SPV2 are disregarded entities for tax purposes and are consolidated with the tax return of the Company.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nOn June 26, 2017, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement renewed automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance was specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the Independent Directors\u201d). On May 26, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Company's Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser for an additional one-year term. Pursuant to relief granted by the SEC in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (the Order\u201d) and a determination by the Board of Directors that reliance on the order was appropriate due to circumstances related to the current or potential side-effects of COVID-19, the May 26 meeting was held by video- and telephone-conference.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components-a management fee and an incentive fee.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the management fee has been calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.00% (1.25% prior to September 12, 2021) of the Company's average Capital Under Management (as defined below) at the end of the then-current quarter and the prior calendar quarter (and, in the case of the Company's first quarter, the Company's Capital Under Management as of such quarter-end). Capital Under Management\u201d means cumulative capital called, less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital (as defined in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K Business-Private Offering-Right to Redraw Capital.\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, Capital Under Management does not include capital acquired through the use of leverage, and Returned Capital does not include distributions of the Company's investment income (i.e., proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends or fees, net of expenses) or net realized capital gains to the investors. On January 11, 2021, in connection with the extension of the Original Investment Period to September 11, 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement with the Investment Adviser, under which the Adviser agreed that its management fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Company's average Capital Under Management, effective September 12, 2021.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part has been calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 15% of pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a preferred return of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized), or hurdle rate,\u201d and a catch-up\u201d feature. The second part has been determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to 15% of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that no incentive fee on capital gains is payable to the Investment Adviser unless cumulative total return exceeds a 7% annual return on weighted average cumulative capital called less cumulative distributions categorized as Returned Capital.\nAt a meeting of the Board held on October 11, 2021, the Board, including all of its Independent Directors, reviewed the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, considered the mechanics of the changes and the Investment Adviser's rationale for the changes and approved the terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement for an initial term of two years, conditional upon stockholders' approval of the proposal to convert the Company to a perpetual life BDC. Pursuant to relief granted by the SEC in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and a determination by the Board that reliance on the order was appropriate due to circumstances related to the current or potential side-effects of COVID-19, the October 11, 2021 meeting was held by video- and telephone-conference.\nOn January 21, 2022, stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, which we executed on January 22, 2022. As a result, we have, among other things:\n\u2022changed the calculation of the income-based incentive fee by reducing the income-based incentive fee rate to 12.5% from 15.0% and by reducing the hurdle rate\u201d to 1.25% (5.0% annualized) from 1.75% (7.0% annualized);\n\u2022reduced the capital gains incentive fee rate to 12.5% from 15.0%; and\n\u2022changed the calculation of the annual base management fee to 1.00% of the Company's net asset value as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (as adjusted for capital called, dividends reinvested, distributions paid and issuer share repurchases made during the current calendar quarter) from 1.00% of the Company's average capital under management\nThe terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement were effective immediately upon execution of the agreement, except that the changes to the calculation of the income-based incentive fee will become effective for the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2022. The Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect until January 21, 2024 and, unless terminated earlier, will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors. The Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days' written notice to the other party.\nAdministration Agreement\nOn April 18, 2017, the Company entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement\u201d) with the Administrator. Unless terminated earlier, the Administration Agreement renews automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the vote of the Board of Directors or by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company's Independent Directors. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party\nand may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days' written notice to the other party. On May 26, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved at an in-person meeting the continuance of the Company's Administration Agreement with the Administrator for an additional one-year term.\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides services and receives reimbursements equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for its costs and expenses and the Company's allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including the Company's allocable portion of the compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by the Company's officers (including the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and respective staff who provide services to the Company, operations staff who provide services to the Company, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in the Company's Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment. Reimbursement under the Administration Agreement occurs quarterly in arrears.\nSub-Administration Agreements\nOn June 26, 2017, the Administrator entered into sub-administration agreements with Carlyle Employee Co. (the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreements, Carlyle Employee Co. provides the Administrator with access to personnel.\nOn June 22, 2017, the Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company ( State Street\u201d and, such agreement, the State Street Sub-Administration Agreement\u201d and, together with the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreements, the Sub-Administration Agreements\u201d).\nOn May 26, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved at an in-person meeting the continuance of the Company's Sub-Administration Agreements for an additional one-year term.\nPlacement Fees\nOn June 26, 2017, the Company entered into a placement fee arrangement with TCG Securities, L.L.C. ( TCG\u201d), a licensed broker-dealer and an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, which may require stockholders to pay a placement fee to TCG for TCG's services.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Company's Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, five of whom are Independent Directors. The Board of Directors has established an audit committee and a pricing committee of the Board of Directors, and may establish additional committees in the future.", "summary": "- This is an excerpt

Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2020, including year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOVERVIEW\nWe were incorporated on February 10, 2017 as a Maryland corporation with the name Carlyle Private Credit, Inc., and our name was changed to TCG BDC II, Inc. on March 3, 2017. We are structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. We conducted the Initial Private Offering and intend to conduct the New Continuous Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We have an indefinite term.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily by investing in senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies supported by financial sponsors, which we define as companies with approximately $25 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow. This core strategy is supplemented with our complementary specialty lending strategy, which takes advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. Generally, we expect our core strategy and our complementary strategy to be 70-85% and 15-30%, respectively, of the portfolio. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche\u201d loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans\u201d), with a minority of our assets invested in investments that are typically higher yielding than Middle Market Senior Loans (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities).\nWe invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt, if rated, is rated below investment grade, and, if not rated, would likely be rated below investment grade if it were rated (that is, below BBB- or Baa3, which is often referred to as junk\u201d). Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Investments-Our investments are risky and speculative.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both our Investment Adviser and our Administrator are wholly owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of Carlyle. Our Investment Adviser's five-person investment committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the investment committee have experience investing through different credit cycles. As of December 31, 2021, our Investment Adviser's investment team included a team of more than 180 investment professionals across the Carlyle Global Credit segment. Our Investment Adviser's investment committee comprises five of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across asset classes and over 26 years of average industry experience and 10 years of average tenure. In addition, our Investment Adviser and its investment team are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle.\nIn conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates.\nKEY COMPONENTS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under an administration agreement between us and our Administrator; (iii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and (iv) other operating expenses as detailed below:\n\u2022administration fees payable under our Sub-Administration Agreements, including related expenses;\n\u2022the costs of any other offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;\n\u2022calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n\u2022expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser, or members of our Investment Adviser team managing our investments, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, expenses of enforcing our rights;\n\u2022certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;\n\u2022the allocated costs incurred by our Investment Adviser in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;\n\u2022amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;\n\u2022the costs associated with subscriptions to data service, research-related subscriptions and expenses and quotation equipment and services used in making or holding investments;\n\u2022transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022costs of hedging;\n\u2022commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n\u2022federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022any U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including any excise taxes;\n\u2022independent director fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records, costs of preparing tax returns, costs of Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and attestation and costs of filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies), and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation or review of the foregoing;\n\u2022the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n\u2022the costs of specialty and custom software for monitoring risk, compliance and overall portfolio, including any development costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC;\n\u2022our fidelity bond;\n\u2022directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022indemnification payments;\n\u2022direct fees and expenses associated with independent audits, agency, consulting and legal costs; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or our Administrator in connection with administering our business, including our allocable share of certain officers and their staff compensation.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nBelow is a summary of certain characteristics of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n(1) Primarily subject to interest rate floors\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated):\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, investments consisted of the following:\n\nThe weighted average yields(1) for our first and second lien debt, based on the amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\n\n(1)Weighted average yields include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at fair value is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at fair value included in such securities. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at amortized cost is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at amortized cost included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.\nTotal weighted average yields (which includes the effect of accretion of discount and amortization of premiums) of our first and second lien debt investments as measured on an amortized cost basis increased from 7.80% to 7.95% from\nDecember 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The increase in weighted average yields was primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that repaid or were sold.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, one and one of our debt investments was on non-accrual status, respectively. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the fair value of our performing and non-accrual/non-performing investments as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\n\n(1) For information regarding our non-accrual policy, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings\u201d. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 - 5, which ratings are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage.\nInternal Risk Ratings Definitions\n Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost bases is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan's risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. \nOur Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings assigned as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our debt investment portfolio was 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and one and one of our debt investments, with an aggregate fair value of $10.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, was assigned an Internal Risk Rating of 4-5.\nSee the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information on our investments, including a list of companies and type and amount of investments.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nThe net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons may not be meaningful.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n\nThe increase in investment income for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the comparable period in 2020 was primarily driven by a higher average investment balance. The size of our portfolio at amortized cost increased to $2,070,975 as of December 31, 2021 from $1,833,385 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt on amortized cost increased to 7.95% from 7.80% as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that were repaid or were sold.\nInterest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan's credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $10,836 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.5% of the total investments at fair value. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2020, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $8,151 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.4% of the total investments at fair value.\nNet investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n\nExpenses\nExpenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 comprised the following:\n\nInterest expense and credit facility fees for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were comprised of the following:\n\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable period in 2020 was driven by increased draws under the Credit Facilities related to increased deployment of capital for investments, offset by lower borrowing costs. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the average interest rate on borrowings decreased to 2.65% from 3.04%, and average principal debt outstanding increased to $961,892 from $726,109.\n\nThe increase in management fees and incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable period in 2020 were driven by our increased deployment of capital and increased net investment income. The accrual for any\ncapital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. No incentive fees on capital gains have been paid for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the incentive and management fees.\nProfessional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. The increase in professional fees, administrative service fees and other general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by the deployment of capital.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we had realized gains on 15 investments totaling $10,949, offset by realized losses on 1 investment totaling $127. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had realized gains on 2 investments totaling $22, offset by realized losses on 6 investments totaling $5,175. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a change in unrealized appreciation on 91 and 64 investments, respectively, totaling $42,839 and $24,270, respectively, which were offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on 58 and 60 investments, respectively, totaling $21,881 and $47,837, respectively.\nNet realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments by the type of investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in our investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable period in 2020 was primarily driven by improving credit fundamentals and tightening market yields in 2021.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in\nportfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our revolving credit facilities and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on October 3, 2017, which was subsequently amended on March 14, 2018, November 16, 2018, May 12, 2020 and October 2, 2020 (as amended, the Subscription Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Facility was $50,000 and is subject to availability under the Subscription Facility, which is based on certain of the Company's unfunded investor equity capital commitments, and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The Subscription Facility has a maturity date of October 3, 2022. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the Subscription Facility bear interest currently at LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 1.95% per year, subject to a 0.50% floor on LIBOR. The Company is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Subscription Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in our equity investors' unfunded capital commitments.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on April 1, 2019 (the SPV Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on October 25, 2019, February 7, 2020 and December 4, 2020, June 2, 2021 and December 28, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the SPV Credit Facility was $700,000 ($600,000 prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment), and is subject to availability under the SPV Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 1, 2025, with one one-year extension option, subject to the SPV's and the lender's consent. The SPV may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate) plus 2.40% per year (2.25% per year with a step-up based on collateral coverage and asset mix prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment). The SPV also pays a fee of between 0.50% and 0.75% per year on undrawn amounts under the SPV Credit Facility. Payments under the SPV Credit Facility are made quarterly. The SPV Credit Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the SPV.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on May 13, 2020 (the SPV2 Credit Facility\u201d, together with the Subscription Facility and SPV Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d), which was subsequently amended on February 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021. The SPV2 Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to a principal amount of $450,000 ($250,000 prior to the February 2021 and August 2021 amendments), subject to availability under the SPV2 Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV2 Credit Facility has a revolving period through May 13, 2023, and a maturity date of May 13, 2028. Borrowings under the SPV2 Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus 2.66% per year (2.95% prior to the February 2021 amendment). SPV2 is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Payments under the SPV2 Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a security interest on substantially all of the assets of SPV2.\nAlthough we believe that we, the SPV and SPV2 will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we, the SPV and SPV2 will continue to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Subscription Facility, the SPV Credit Facility and/or the SPV2 Credit Facility that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the respective facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that we cannot meet our financing obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses.\nFor more information on the Credit Facilities, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $65,838 and $50,217 respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The Credit Facilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n(1)The unused portion is the amount upon which commitment fees are based.\n(2)Available for borrowing based on the computation of collateral to support the borrowings and subject to compliance with applicable covenants and financial ratios.\nEquity Activity\nShares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 57,005,057 and 49,062,820, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes activity in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for any such exposure.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments.\nWe had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of the indicated dates:\n\nDIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\nThe following table summarizes our dividends declared and payable during the three most recent fiscal years:\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, as well as with our Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e. consensus pricing\u201d). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.\nSecurities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded\ninvestment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management's preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee\u201d) reviews the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.\nAll factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant:\n\u2022the nature and realizable value of any collateral;\n\u2022call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;\n\u2022the portfolio company's leverage and ability to make payments;\n\u2022the portfolio company's public or private credit rating;\n\u2022the portfolio company's actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;\n\u2022prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;\n\u2022the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and\n\u2022comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.\nInvestment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificate received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFor further information on the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on fair value measurements.\nInvestments\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nRevenue Recognition\nNon-Accrual Income\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) within this section is focused on the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, including year-to-year comparisons between these years. Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2020, including year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOVERVIEW\nWe were incorporated on February 10, 2017 as a Maryland corporation with the name Carlyle Private Credit, Inc., and our name was changed to TCG BDC II, Inc. on March 3, 2017. We are structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. We conducted the Initial Private Offering and intend to conduct the New Continuous Offering of our shares of common stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We have an indefinite term.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns and current income primarily by investing in senior secured term loans to U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors hold, directly or indirectly, a financial interest in the form of debt and/or equity. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies supported by financial sponsors, which we define as companies with approximately $25 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow. This core strategy is supplemented with our complementary specialty lending strategy, which takes advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk-diversifying portfolio benefits. Generally, we expect our core strategy and our complementary strategy to be 70-85% and 15-30%, respectively, of the portfolio. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and unitranche\u201d loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, Middle Market Senior Loans\u201d), with a minority of our assets invested in investments that are typically higher yielding than Middle Market Senior Loans (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities).\nWe invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt, if rated, is rated below investment grade, and, if not rated, would likely be rated below investment grade if it were rated (that is, below BBB- or Baa3, which is often referred to as junk\u201d). Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Investments-Our investments are risky and speculative.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both our Investment Adviser and our Administrator are wholly owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of Carlyle. Our Investment Adviser's five-person investment committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the investment committee have experience investing through different credit cycles. As of December 31, 2021, our Investment Adviser's investment team included a team of more than 180 investment professionals across the Carlyle Global Credit segment. Our Investment Adviser's investment committee comprises five of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across asset classes and over 26 years of average industry experience and 10 years of average tenure. In addition, our Investment Adviser and its investment team are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle.\nIn conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates.\nKEY COMPONENTS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under an administration agreement between us and our Administrator; (iii) debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and (iv) other operating expenses as detailed below:\n\u2022administration fees payable under our Sub-Administration Agreements, including related expenses;\n\u2022the costs of any other offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;\n\u2022calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n\u2022expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser, or members of our Investment Adviser team managing our investments, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, expenses of enforcing our rights;\n\u2022certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;\n\u2022the allocated costs incurred by our Investment Adviser in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;\n\u2022amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;\n\u2022the costs associated with subscriptions to data service, research-related subscriptions and expenses and quotation equipment and services used in making or holding investments;\n\u2022transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022costs of hedging;\n\u2022commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n\u2022federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022any U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including any excise taxes;\n\u2022independent director fees and expenses;\n\u2022costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records, costs of preparing tax returns, costs of Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and attestation and costs of filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies), and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation or review of the foregoing;\n\u2022the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n\u2022the costs of specialty and custom software for monitoring risk, compliance and overall portfolio, including any development costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC;\n\u2022our fidelity bond;\n\u2022directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022indemnification payments;\n\u2022direct fees and expenses associated with independent audits, agency, consulting and legal costs; and\n\u2022all other expenses incurred by us or our Administrator in connection with administering our business, including our allocable share of certain officers and their staff compensation.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nBelow is a summary of certain characteristics of our

Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at fair value is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at fair value included in such securities. Weighted average yield on debt and income producing securities at amortized cost is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of OID and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt at amortized cost included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.\nTotal weighted average yields (which includes the effect of accretion of discount and amortization of premiums) of our first and second lien debt investments as measured on an amortized cost basis increased from 7.80% to 7.95% from\nDecember 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The increase in weighted average yields was primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that repaid or were sold.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, one and one of our debt investments was on non-accrual status, respectively.

Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 - 5, which ratings are defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage.\nInternal Risk Ratings Definitions\n Rating Definition 1 Borrower is operating above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 2 Borrower is operating generally as expected or at an acceptable level of performance. The level of risk to our initial cost bases is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination. This is the initial risk rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Borrower is operating below expectations and level of risk to our cost basis has increased since the time of origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants. Payments are generally current although there may be higher risk of payment default. 4 Borrower is operating materially below expectations and the loan's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due, but generally not by more than 120 days. It is anticipated that we may not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 5 Borrower is operating substantially below expectations and the loan's risk has increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. It is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. \nOur Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the risk ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings assigned as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollar amounts in millions) </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Fair Value </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Risk Rating 1 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Risk Rating 2 </td> <td>1,671.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,425.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Risk Rating 3 </td> <td>290.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Risk Rating 4 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal Risk Rating 5 </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,012.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,783.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our debt investment portfolio was 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and one and one of our debt investments, with an aggregate fair value of $10.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, was assigned an Internal Risk Rating of 4-5.\nSee the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information on our investments, including a list of companies and type and amount of investments.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nThe net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation.

The size of our portfolio at amortized cost increased to $2,070,975 as of December 31, 2021 from $1,833,385 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average yield of our first and second lien debt on amortized cost increased to 7.95% from 7.80% as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to new fundings being originated at a higher weighted average yield than the yield of positions that were repaid or were sold.\nInterest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan's credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $10,836 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.5% of the total investments at fair value. The remaining first and second lien debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2020, one loan in the portfolio with a fair value of $8,151 was on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 0.4% of the total investments at fair value.\nNet investment

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the average interest rate on borrowings decreased to 2.65% from 3.04%, and average principal debt outstanding increased to $961,892 from $726,109.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,259 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive fees on pre-incentive fee net investment income </td> <td>18,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized capital gains incentive fees </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued capital gains incentive fees </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital gains incentive fees </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total incentive fees </td> <td>18,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total base management fees and incentive fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in management fees and incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the comparable period in 2020 were driven by our increased deployment of capital and increased net investment income. The accrual for any\ncapital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. No incentive fees on capital gains have been paid for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the incentive and management fees.\nProfessional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. The increase in professional fees, administrative service fees and other general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by the deployment of capital.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments </td> <td>20,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,512) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,665) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we had realized gains on 15 investments totaling $10,949, offset by realized losses on 1 investment totaling $127.

We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Credit Facilities, as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in\nportfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our revolving credit facilities and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on October 3, 2017, which was subsequently amended on March 14, 2018, November 16, 2018, May 12, 2020 and October 2, 2020 (as amended, the Subscription Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Facility was $50,000 and is subject to availability under the Subscription Facility, which is based on certain of the Company's unfunded investor equity capital commitments, and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The Subscription Facility has a maturity date of October 3, 2022. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the Subscription Facility bear interest currently at LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 1.95% per year, subject to a 0.50% floor on LIBOR. The Company is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Subscription Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in our equity investors' unfunded capital commitments.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on April 1, 2019 (the SPV Credit Facility\u201d), which was subsequently amended on October 25, 2019, February 7, 2020 and December 4, 2020, June 2, 2021 and December 28, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum principal amount of the SPV Credit Facility was $700,000 ($600,000 prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment), and is subject to availability under the SPV Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 1, 2025, with one one-year extension option, subject to the SPV's and the lender's consent. The SPV may borrow amounts in U.S. Dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate) plus 2.40% per year (2.25% per year with a step-up based on collateral coverage and asset mix prior to the December 28, 2021 amendment). The SPV also pays a fee of between 0.50% and 0.75% per year on undrawn amounts under the SPV Credit Facility. Payments under the SPV Credit Facility are made quarterly. The SPV Credit Facility is secured by a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the SPV.\nWe entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a lender on May 13, 2020 (the SPV2 Credit Facility\u201d, together with the Subscription Facility and SPV Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d), which was subsequently amended on February 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021. The SPV2 Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to a principal amount of $450,000 ($250,000 prior to the February 2021 and August 2021 amendments), subject to availability under the SPV2 Credit Facility and restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act. The SPV2 Credit Facility has a revolving period through May 13, 2023, and a maturity date of May 13, 2028. Borrowings under the SPV2 Credit Facility bear interest initially at LIBOR (or, if applicable, a rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus 2.66% per year (2.95% prior to the February 2021 amendment). SPV2 is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25% per year. Payments under the SPV2 Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a security interest on substantially all of the assets of SPV2.\nAlthough we believe that we, the SPV and SPV2 will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we, the SPV and SPV2 will continue to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Subscription Facility, the SPV Credit Facility and/or the SPV2 Credit Facility that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the respective facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent that we cannot meet our financing obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses.\nFor more information on the Credit Facilities, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $65,838 and $50,217 respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.

These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, as well as with our Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e. consensus pricing\u201d). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to U.S. GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.\nSecurities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded\ninvestment is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management's preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee\u201d) reviews the assessments of the Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.\nAll factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the following factors, as relevant:\n\u2022the nature and realizable value of any collateral;\n\u2022call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;\n\u2022the portfolio company's leverage and ability to make payments;\n\u2022the portfolio company's public or private credit rating;\n\u2022the portfolio company's actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;\n\u2022prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;\n\u2022the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and\n\u2022comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.\nInvestment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificate received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFor further information on the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on fair value measurements.\nInvestments\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nRevenue Recognition\nNon-Accrual Income\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual"}
