MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the information presented under Part II, Item 6, \"Selected Financial Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nMany statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information regarding industry outlook as well as possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. These statements often include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"suggests,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"projects,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"forecast\" and other similar expressions. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" as well as \"Risk Factors\" and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adverse developments in

We have over a 150-year heritage in the coatings industry and are known for manufacturing high-quality products with well-recognized brands supported by market-leading technologies and customer service. Our diverse global footprint of 49 manufacturing facilities, four technology centers, 47 customer training centers and approximately 13,300 employees allows us to meet the needs of customers in over 130 countries. We serve our customers through an extensive sales force and technical support organization, as well as through approximately 4,000 independent, locally based distributors.\nWe operate our business in two operating segments, Performance Coatings and Transportation Coatings. Our segments are based on the type and concentration of customers served, service requirements, methods of distribution and major product lines.\nThrough our Performance Coatings segment, we provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings solutions to a fragmented and local customer base. We are one of only a few suppliers with the technology to provide precise color matching and highly durable coatings systems. The end-markets within this segment are refinish and industrial.\nThrough our Transportation Coatings segment we provide advanced coating technologies to OEMs of light and commercial vehicles. These increasingly global customers require a high level of technical support coupled with cost-effective, environmentally responsible, coatings systems that can be applied with a high degree of precision, consistency and speed. The end-markets within this segment are light vehicle and commercial vehicle.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nGeneral Business Highlights\nOur net sales increased 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by impacts of acquisitions within our Performance Coatings segment. Organic volume growth in our Transportation Coatings segment was largely offset by decreases in our Performance Coatings segment, resulting in an overall increase of 0.2%, excluding acquisitions. Declines in average selling prices in our Transportation Coatings segment resulting primarily from pricing across all regions within our light vehicle end-market were offset partially by price increases in our refinish end-market, contributing to a net decrease of 1.0%. Currency translation contributed to an increase of net sales of 0.4%. The following trends have impacted our segment and end-market sales performance:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Performance Coatings: Net sales increased 11.5% driven by stronger volumes in our industrial end-market, including the impacts of acquisitions, combined with organic volume growth in EMEA and Asia and increases in average selling price in our refinish end-market. Performance Coatings volumes were impacted in 2017 due partially to the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations and impacts from distributor working capital adjustments in North America.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transportation Coatings: Net sales increased modestly by 0.4% compared to 2016 with offsetting impacts from stronger volumes in both our light vehicle and commercial vehicle end-markets and lower average selling prices in our light vehicle end-market, primarily in North America and Asia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our business serves four end-markets globally as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refinish\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,645.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,679.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,698.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>1,029.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>2,675.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,381.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Light Vehicle\n</td> <td>1,322.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,337.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Vehicle\n</td> <td>355.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,677.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,352.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we successfully completed eight strategic business acquisitions (\"2017 Acquisitions\") within our Performance Coatings segment. Included in these acquisitions was the purchase of the Industrial Wood business in North America, which is discussed in further detail at Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2017 aggregate spending for these 2017 Acquisitions was $564.4 million. The impact of acquisitions contributed $299.3 million to net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCapital and Liquidity Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which increased the aggregate principal balance of our Dollar Term Loans to $2.0 billion of which the net proceeds were used to fund the Industrial Wood Acquisition and certain other 2017 Acquisitions. In addition, this amendment extended the maturity date on our Dollar Term Loans and lowered interest rates. The benefits of this refinancing transaction are anticipated to save approximately $7.7 million in annual cash interest compared to the previous principal balances. For additional information, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Liquidity and Capital Resource discussion within this Item 7.\nOther Highlights\nIn March 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $675.0 million. We expect the share repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The pace of repurchase activity will be subject to our discretion, and will be based upon market conditions and other capital allocation decisions, while incorporating key factors including cash balances and needs of the business, cash flow from operations, stock price and acquisition opportunities. There is no expiration date on the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, repurchases totaled $58.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. TCJA legislation was enacted into law, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have assessed the impacts of the changes from the U.S. TCJA, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), and recorded a provisional net tax charge of $107.8 million. The provisionally estimated net tax charge reflects our current estimate of the new legislation's impact, which may differ with further regulatory guidance, changes in our current interpretations and assumptions and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation. For more information refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nNet sales\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our products across all major geographic areas. Our net sales include total sales less estimates for returns and price allowances. Price allowances include discounts for prompt payment as well as volume-based incentives. Our overall net sales are generally impacted by the following factors:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fluctuations in overall economic activity within the geographic markets in which we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>underlying growth in one or more of our end-markets, either worldwide or in particular geographies in which we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the type of products used within existing customer applications, or the development of new applications requiring products similar to ours;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in product sales prices (including volume discounts and cash discounts for prompt payment);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the level of competition faced by our products, including price competition and the launch of new products by competitors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to successfully develop and launch new products and applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in buying habits of our customers (including our distributors); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> While the factors described above impact net sales in each of our operating segments, the impact of these factors on our operating segments can differ, as described below. For more information about risks relating to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business.\"\nOther revenue\nOther revenue consists primarily of consulting and other service revenue and royalty income.\nCost of goods sold (\"cost of sales\")\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the following:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Production materials costs. We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in production on a global lowest-cost basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Employee costs. These include the compensation and benefit costs, including share-based compensation expense, for employees involved in our manufacturing operations. These costs generally increase on an aggregate basis as production volumes increase and may decline as a percent of net sales as a result of economies of scale associated with higher production volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Depreciation expense. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Interest expense, net also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other indebtedness.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, on various non-operational items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, historical management expenses to Carlyle (prior to the Change in Control as defined herein), indemnity gains and losses associated with the Acquisition, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses on assets that are not part of our core operational activities.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, changes to the debt and equity capitalization of our subsidiaries, and the realignment of the functions performed and risks assumed by the various subsidiaries are among the factors that will determine the future book and taxable income of the respective subsidiary and the Company as a whole.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We define our core business as those operations relating to the Company's ongoing performance and the concept is used to make resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment performance.\nEBITDA consists of net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-cash items included within net income, (ii) items the Company does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (iii) nonrecurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not occurred within the last two years or we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.\nWe believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 included the benefits of acquisitions which contributed to an increase in net sales of 7.4%. Further contributing to this sales growth was an increase in organic sales volumes in our commercial vehicle and industrial end-markets, which was largely offset by declines in our refinish end-market, particularly within Latin America and North America, resulting in a net increase of 0.2%. Lower average sales prices contributed to a 1.0% decrease driven primarily by declines in our Transportation Coatings segment. Net sales were also impacted by favorable impacts of currency translation, which increased net sales by 0.4%, due primarily to the impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar which were slightly offset by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting from the favorable impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales increased $252.0 million, or 10.0%, to $2,779.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of 7.6%, inclusive of impacts of acquisitions. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro against the U.S. dollar offset partially by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar, which contributed to a 0.5% increase. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of lower average selling prices and raw material inflation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.2 million, or 3.7%, to $997.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from the impacts of acquisitions of $48.6 million as well as our focus on opportunities to expand our market presence and invest in commercial capabilities.\nFurthering this increase was unfavorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2017, which contributed to an approximate 0.6% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our Axalta Way cost savings initiatives and acquisition-related costs which were $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $77.6 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an $13.8 million decrease over the comparable period.\nVenezuela asset impairment and deconsolidation charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $70.9 million in conjunction with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge for $57.9 million relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. See further discussion in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.6 million, or 13.2%, to $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of additional spend as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products, as well as the impacts from acquisitions of $9.1 million. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro and certain currencies in Latin America against the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease resulting from the impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $17.8 million, or 21.3%, to $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was attributable to the amortization of the definite-lived intangible assets from our acquisitions, as well as a $1.7 million of impairment related to abandoned in-process research and development intangible assets. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $31.2 million, or 17.5%, to $147.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by the refinancing of our indebtedness during 2016 and 2017 which reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio, partially offset by increases resulting from the incremental indebtedness used to finance the Industrial Wood Acquisition.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased $117.0 million, or 82.0%, to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to the decrease in losses on debt extinguishment and refinancing related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 which resulted in an $84.2 million decrease over the comparable period.\nIn addition, there was a reduction in foreign exchange losses, net from $30.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a $23.2 million decrease over the comparable period. Prior to deconsolidation, our Venezuela subsidiary contributed $1.8 million and $23.5 million in foreign exchange losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFurthering this decrease was a $2.9 million decrease in impairments to $7.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with impairments related to the manufacturing facilities closures, compared to the impairment of $10.5 million related to our real estate investment in Venezuela incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $141.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 74.8% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $189.6 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 39.8%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $56.2 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.1 million and $17.7 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. Furthermore, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $26.8 million related to the tax basis in our deconsolidated Venezuelan subsidiary, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance as we do not expect to realize the benefits. In addition, a pre-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $70.9 million had an unfavorable impact of $24.8 million as it was nondeductible. The impact of the U.S. TCJA (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) resulted in a tax charge of $107.8 million primarily as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and impact on certain tax attributes. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $45.3 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $14.4 million and the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 million negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table was derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>4,092.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,110.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>2,527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,597.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>962.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela asset impairment\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>403.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>178.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>142.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>82.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales\nNet sales decreased $15.1 million, or 0.4%, to $4,068.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $4,083.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to unfavorable impacts of currency translation, which reduced net sales by 4.6% due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia compared to the U.S. dollar. This net sales decline was partially offset by higher average selling prices across both our segments, primarily in Latin America, which contributed to an increase of 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Increases in volumes across both our segments, in Europe, Asia and North America, attributable mainly to a 2.2% increase from our acquisitions, also contributed to net sales growth of 1.7%.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily related to declines in service revenue combined with the impacts of weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, which caused a decrease of $0.8 million, or 3.1%.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased $69.7 million, or 2.7%, to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2,597.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 2.1% decrease associated with currency translation due to the impact of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America, Asia and Europe. The decrease from currency translation was slightly offset by the contribution of higher volumes of 1.7% which includes impacts of our acquisitions completed during 2016. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of reductions associated with lower raw material prices, favorable pricing on our product mix and impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 5.2%, to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $914.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $77.6 million of costs related to our cost-savings initiatives as compared to $64.4 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with our transition-related activities and cost-savings initiatives, resulting in an increase of $13.2 million over the comparable period. In addition, there was an increase of $8.0 million in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further contributing to the increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period were increases in selling expense associated with increased sales volumes and $17.5 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting these increases were favorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2016, which contributed to an approximately 1.7% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nVenezuela asset impairment\nVenezuela asset impairment relates to the impairment charge of $57.9 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. There was no comparative impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.1 million, or 11.8%, to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was driven by additional spending as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $2.7 million, or 3.3%, to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was a result of our recent acquisitions, which contributed $3.5 million, offset slightly by the impacts of weakening currencies in all regions against the U.S. dollar.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $18.3 million, or 9.3%, to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was driven by the prepayment of principal balances associated with our 2020 Dollar Term Loans made in 2015 and 2016 and the prepayment on the principal balance of our 2020 Euro Term Loans made in 2016. Additionally, refinancing of our senior indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016, reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio and further contributed to the decrease.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased $31.5 million, or 28.3%, to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amendment to our Credit Agreement, refinancing of our indebtedness and prepayments of our Term Loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in other expense over the comparable period of $95.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 there were $4.3 million in losses on derivative instruments associated with our foreign currency contracts compared to $5.6 million in gains during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in a $9.9 million increase. In addition, we recognized a gain of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held interest in an equity method investee upon the acquisition of a controlling interest whereas no similar gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016, thereby resulting in an increase in other expense, net for the comparable periods.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our Venezuelan subsidiary continued to be impacted by a significant devaluation of its currency translation rates. This devaluation resulted in impairment charges of $10.5 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on our evaluation of the carrying value associated with our real estate investment, resulting in a decrease of $20.1 million over the comparable period.\nOffsetting the year over year loss, foreign exchange losses, net, decreased from $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of our Venezuela subsidiary which resulted in $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining decrease primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany transactional exposures denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a 39.3% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $157.9 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 4.3%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to China, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands, which had a net favorable impact of $41.4 million. Additionally, $10.5 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charge in Venezuela of $30.6 million which had an unfavorable $10.7 million impact on the effective rate as it was nondeductible, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $34.4 million, and the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $10.4 million.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,675.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,677.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,352.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>321.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $276.6 million, or 11.5%, to $2,675.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by increased volumes of 10.7%. This included a 12.0% benefit from acquisitions and organic volume decreases, which were comprised of industrial end-market increases more than offset by decreases in our refinish end-market driven by distributor working capital adjustments in North America, as well as the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations. Higher average selling prices contributed to an increase of 0.5%, and favorable impacts of currency exchange primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar contributed to a 0.3% increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $14.5 million, or 2.6%, to $564.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by impacts of acquisitions and higher average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of higher variable costs across all regions and end-markets.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $7.5 million, or 0.4%, to $1,677.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by an increase in sales volumes which contributed to growth of 3.0%. This included organic volume increases in both end-markets as well as a 0.7% benefit from acquisitions. Further contributing to the increase was the favorable impacts of currency exchange related to strengthening of the Euro and certain currencies in Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar which contributed to a 0.5% increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increases were lower average selling prices across both end-markets contributing to a 3.1% decrease.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $31.7 million, or 9.0%, to $321.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by lower average selling prices and higher variable costs in our light vehicle end-market, partially offset by volume growth across both end-markets.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,381.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>352.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $16.7 million, or 0.7%, to $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $2,381.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of higher average selling prices and volumes which contributed 3.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Contributions from price included a stronger product mix which was driven by our North America and Latin America regions. Volume growth in both our refinish and industrial end-markets included a 3.2% benefit from our acquisitions, slightly offset by the negative volume contribution from Latin America. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 5.8% reduction in net sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $13.9 million, or 2.6%, to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $535.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices, primarily in our refinish end-market, increases in sales volumes in both end-markets combined with lower variable costs across all regions and the impacts related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting this increase were unfavorable impacts of currency exchange across all regions, due mainly to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales decreased $31.8 million, or 1.9%, to 1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $1,702.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 3.0% reduction in net sales. Offsetting the decline in net sales was a 1.0% increase in average selling prices primarily driven by Latin America. Volume of 0.1% was driven by strong performances in North America and Asia, including a 0.7% impact from acquisitions, which was largely offset by weaker volumes in Latin America.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $24.6 million, or 7.5%, to $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and lower variable costs. This increase was partially offset by higher operating costs combined with the unfavorable impacts of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nAt December 31, 2017, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $364.5 million, net of $35.5 million of letters of credit outstanding. All such availability may be utilized without violating any covenants under the credit agreement governing such facility or the indentures governing the New Senior Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had $13.1 million of outstanding borrowings under other lines of credit. Our remaining available borrowing capacity under other lines of credit in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions totaled $5.1 million.\nWe or our affiliates, at any time and from time to time, may purchase shares of our common stock, the New Senior Notes or other indebtedness. Any such purchases may be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more redemption, tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we, or any of our affiliates, may determine.\nCash Flows\nYears ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment and refinancing related costs\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela deconsolidation charge\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-cash items\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income adjusted for non-cash items\n</td> <td>626.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>609.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>(86.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(50.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(177.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>540.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(689.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(257.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(166.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>367.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(84.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(58.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $540.0 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of $626.1 million. This was partially offset by uses of working capital of $86.1 million. The most significant drivers in working capital were increases in accounts receivables of $15.2 million, inventory of $19.9 million and other assets of $84.9 million. These were primarily caused by incremental net sales, increased inventory builds to support ongoing operational demands and upfront customer incentive payments during the year ended December 31, 2017. Other uses were due to a reduction in other liabilities of $12.6 million related to payments of normal operating activities, offset by increases in accounts payable of $39.8 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $689.6 million. This use was driven by business acquisitions of $564.4 million (net of cash acquired), purchases of property, plant and equipment of $125.0 million, reduction of cash due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations of $4.3 million, and net cash provided for other investing activities of $4.1 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $367.3 million. This inflow was driven by net proceeds from borrowings of $483.6 million primarily relating to the refinancing of our Dollar Term Loans, and proceeds of $24.8 million from cash received from stock option exercises. These proceeds were partially offset by purchases of treasury stock for $58.4 million and other payments of $82.7 million consisting of financing-related costs, pay-down of short-term and long-term borrowings, deferred acquisition-related consideration and dividends to noncontrolling interests.\nOther Impacts on Cash\nFavorable currency exchange impacts on cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $17.1 million, which were driven primarily by the strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $559.3 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of $609.3 million. This was partially offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities of $50.0 million. The most significant drivers in working capital were increases in accounts receivables and other assets of $132.3 million due primarily to incremental net sales and upfront customer payments, offset by net increases in current and non-current liabilities of $84.0 million primarily related to cost savings initiatives and timing of operating activities, which includes increases in accounts payable of $32.3 million.\nNet Cash Used for Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $257.0 million. This use was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment of $136.2 million and acquisitions of $114.8 million (net of cash acquired), and $6.0 million of other investing activities that includes $3.9 million of asset acquisitions.\nNet Cash Used for Financing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $232.6 million. This use was driven by payments of $1,755.7 million relating to the redemption of our 2021 Dollar and Euro Senior Notes, the net paydown and early repayments of our 2020 Term Loans, and quarterly principal payments as required under the Credit Agreement. These payments were offset by proceeds of $1,604.3 million relating to the issuance of our new 2024 Dollar and Euro Senior Notes and our new 2025 Euro Senior Notes, as well as the increase in principal on our 2023 Euro Term Loans as a part of the refinancing. The issuance and refinancing of our new indebtedness required us to pay financing costs of $86.3 million, which included a premium for early redemption of our 2021 Dollar and Euro Senior Notes of $56.6 million.\nIn addition, we had cash received from stock options exercised for $16.7 million, which is offset by repayments of short-term borrowings of $8.6 million, dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $3.0 million, and $0.2 million of other financing activities.\nOther Impacts on Cash\nUnfavorable currency exchange impacts on cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $19.3 million primarily driven by the weakening of our translation rates compared to the U.S. dollar for our Venezuelan subsidiary which contributed $14.0 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $409.8 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of $587.4 million. This was partially offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities of $177.6 million. The most significant drivers in working capital were increases in accounts receivables and other assets of $126.7 million due primarily to the mix of credit terms which drove an increase in days sales outstanding and increased inventory builds of $35.2 million to support ongoing operational demands. Cash flows associated with accounts payable and other liabilities of $29.1 million related to payments of normal operating activities incurred in 2014 and paid during 2015.\nNet Cash Used for Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $166.2 million. This use was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment of $138.1 million and acquisitions of $29.6 million (net of cash received).\nNet Cash Used for Financing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84.7 million. The change was primarily driven by repayment of term loans of $127.3 million. These payments were comprised of a $100.0 million prepayment on our 2020 Dollar Term Loans made during the year ended December 31, 2015, along with $27.3 million of quarterly principal repayments as required under the Credit Agreement. In addition to these payments, we also paid dividends to non-controlling interests of $4.7 million. Offsetting these payments were cash received from stock option exercises for $62.4 million, and proceeds received from short-term borrowings during the period of $2.0 million.\nOther Impacts on Cash\nUnfavorable currency exchange impacts on cash for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $58.0 million primarily driven by the weakening of our translation rates compared to the U.S. dollar for our Venezuelan subsidiary which contributed $37.4 million.\nFinancial Condition\nWe had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $769.8 million and $535.4 million, respectively. Of these balances, $398.9 million and $366.7 million were maintained in non-U.S. jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe our organizational structure allows us the necessary flexibility to move funds throughout our subsidiaries to meet our operational working capital needs.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including planned capital expenditures. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Indebtedness-To service all of our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\u201d Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. Based on our forecasts, we believe that cash flow from operations, available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and existing lines of credit will be adequate to service debt, fund our cost-savings initiatives, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures for the next twelve months.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness or to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other current obligations will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Such cash generation is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf required, our ability to raise additional financing and our borrowing costs may be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our highly leveraged nature may limit our ability to procure additional financing in the future.\nThe following table details our borrowings outstanding at the periods indicated:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 Dollar Term Loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,960.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 Dollar Term Loans\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,545.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 Euro Term Loans\n</td> <td>472.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 Dollar Senior Notes\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 Euro Senior Notes\n</td> <td>399.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 Euro Senior Notes\n</td> <td>536.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term and other borrowings\n</td> <td>94.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized original issue discount\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing costs, net\n</td> <td>(39.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(48.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,915.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,263.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short term borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,877.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,236.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Senior Notes, is more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur liquidity requirements are significant due to the highly leveraged nature of our company as well as our working capital requirements.

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and re-evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies, which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions, are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.\nThe fair values of intangible assets are estimated using an income approach, either the excess earnings method (customer relationships) or the relief from royalty method (technology and trademarks). Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. These intangible assets enable us to secure markets for our products, develop new products to meet the evolving business needs and competitively produce our existing products.\nThe fair values of real properties acquired are based on the consideration of their highest and best use in the market. The fair values of property, plant and equipment, other than real properties, are based on the consideration that unless otherwise identified, they will continue to be used \"as is\" and as part of the ongoing business. In contemplation of the in-use premise and the nature of the assets, the fair value is developed primarily using a cost approach.\nThe determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessing factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition.\nThe fair value of noncontrolling interests, when applicable, are estimated by applying an income approach and is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions in the valuation of noncontrolling interest included a discount rate, a terminal value based on a range of long-term sustainable growth rates and adjustments because of the lack of control that market participants would consider when measuring the fair value of the noncontrolling interests.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by applying an income approach using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value measurements are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions in the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities included discount rates, expected terms, volatility rates and operating results as applicable based on the targets identified in the respective acquisition agreements.\nThe results of operations for businesses acquired are included in the financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the related accounting.\nAsset Impairments\nFactors that could result in future impairment charges or changes in useful lives, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in technology, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually as of October 1st. We initially test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative evaluation. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit or asset specific operating results and cost factors, as well as industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than the respective carrying amounts, including goodwill when testing goodwill for impairment. In the event the qualitative assessment indicates that an impairment is more likely than not, we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a two-step quantitative test. Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using a combination of discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods, that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenue and cash flows, and multiples of earnings in estimating fair value. In conjunction with our impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we also review the reasonableness of the indefinite useful lives associated with these assets, in which we evaluate whether indicators exist that future cash flows associated with these assets could be realized over a finite period.\nFor the 2017 impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, management performed the two-step quantitative test. This test concluded that the carrying values exceeded the respective fair values and no impairments existed. In addition, during 2017 we changed certain indefinite-lived intangible assets to definite-lived intangible assets, as discussed further in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe inputs utilized in a quantitative analysis are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is subjective because it requires the use of estimates and assumptions as to our future cash flows, discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets, future economic and market conditions, as well as other key assumptions. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate Axalta management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nGoodwill is allocated to, and evaluated for impairment at, the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We have two operating segments - Performance Coatings and Transportation Coatings - that also serve as our reportable segments. We have goodwill allocated to each of our four reporting units. At December 31, 2017, our $1,271.2 million in total goodwill is allocated to reportable segments as follows: $1,189.2 million in Performance Coatings and $82.0 million in Transportation Coatings.\nOther intangible assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, such as technology, trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from 2 to 20 years. The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is continually evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the balance sheet.\nThe in-process research and development projects we acquired in conjunction with the Acquisition are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets until the abandonment or completion of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the research and development process, the carrying values of acquired in process research and development projects are reclassified as definite-lived assets and are amortized over their useful lives. If the project is abandoned, we record the write-off as a loss in the statement of operations.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, which includes property, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset. In the event the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset and the carrying amount is not considered recoverable, an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. An impairment loss is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that the impairment occurs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to service-based, non-qualified stock options is equivalent to the grant-date fair value of the awards determined under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is being recognized as compensation expense over the service period utilizing the graded vesting attribution method.\nCompensation expense related to the restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is equal to the grant-date fair value of the awards determined by the closing share price on the date of the grant. The related expense is being recognized as compensation expense over the service period utilizing the graded vesting attribution method.\nCompensation expense related to performance stock awards and performance share units is equivalent to the grant-date fair value of the awards determined using a valuation methodology (Monte Carlo simulation model) to account for the market conditions linked to these awards. These awards are tied to the Company's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the TSR of a selected industry peer group. Each award covers a three-year performance cycle with a three-year service period vesting requirement. Awards will cliff vest upon meeting the applicable TSR thresholds and the three-year service requirement. The actual number of shares awarded is adjusted to between zero and 200% of the target award amount based upon achievement of pre-determined objectives relative to a peer group. TSR relative to peers is considered a market condition under applicable authoritative guidance. The related expense is being recognized as compensation expense over the service period utilizing the graded vesting attribution method.\nWe recognize compensation expense net of forfeitures, which we have elected to record at the time of occurrence.\nThe fair value of non-qualified stock options granted from 2015 through 2017 and the respective principal weighted average assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes model were as follows:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Key Assumptions\n</td> <td>2017 Grants\n</td> <td>2016 Grants\n</td> <td>2015 Grants\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Term\n</td> <td>6.00 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volatility\n</td> <td>21.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>21.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>22.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend Yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value of Options Per Share\n</td> <td>$7.20 - $8.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.68 - $6.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6.27 - $8.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on stock based compensation.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in the audited financial statements related to pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which liabilities could have been settled, rate of increase in future compensations levels, and mortality rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differed from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.\nFor the majority of our defined benefit pension obligations, we utilize prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices applicable to the respective country at each measurement date. In countries where established corporate bond markets do not exist, we utilize other index movement and duration analysis to determine discount rates. The calculation separately discounts benefit payments using the spot rates from a long-term, high-quality corporate bond yield curve.\nThe estimated impact of either a 100 basis point increase or decrease of the discount rate to the net periodic benefit cost for 2018 would result in an increase of $0.3 million in both scenarios. The estimated impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease of the expected return on asset assumption on the net periodic benefit cost for 2018 would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $3.1 million, respectively.\nIncome taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the period. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a net deferred tax asset balance of $45.5 million, after valuation allowances of $214.2 million. At December 31, 2016, we had a net deferred tax asset balance of $162.2 million, after valuation allowances of $135.4 million. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss, interest and tax credit carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company must generate approximately $268.3 million of taxable income to fully realize its consolidated net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including the reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted core business earnings and available tax planning strategies. Of our net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2017, $137.1 million, net of valuation allowances of $26.1 million, relates to our operations within the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, our operations within the U.S. are in a three-year cumulative income position. In instances where we are in a three-year cumulative loss, we assess all positive and negative factors including any potential aberrational items which may be included within our taxable results. The aberrational items which have impacted our results include transition-related costs associated with the separation from our Predecessor coupled with significant taxable losses associated with the exercises of pre-IPO stock options that were deep in the money at the time they were exercised, as well as debt extinguishment, refinancing and acquisition related costs. We believe, and have assumed, these types of losses are not indicative of our core earnings for purposes of assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Assumptions around sources of taxable income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. While the Company believes that its judgments and estimations regarding deferred tax assets are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require the Company to adjust its valuation allowance and could materially affect the Company's future financial results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. TCJA legislation was enacted into law and contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the U.S. TCJA was passed late in December 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the coming months, we consider the accounting of the impacts of the U.S. TCJA, and other items to be provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of our tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the one-year measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.\nWe provide for income and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on unremitted earnings of all subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 deferred income taxes of approximately $7.4 million and $5.8 million have been provided on such subsidiary earnings, respectively. At December 31, 2017, and 2016, we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to withholding taxes of approximately $4.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries that are permanently invested.\nThe breadth of our operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes we will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded when management concludes that the likelihood of sustaining such positions upon examination by taxing authorities is less than \"more likely than not.\" Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in the provision for income taxes. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for both domestic and foreign operations of $17.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on our accounting for income taxes.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, we measure hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of the hedges are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in the statement of operations.\nWe account for interest rate caps related to our existing long-term borrowings as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to interest expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair values of the derivatives are recorded in interest expense in the period ineffectiveness is determined.\nIf no hedging relationship is designated, derivatives are marked to market through the statement of operations. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions.\nSee Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on our derivatives and hedging instruments.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Due primarily to our legal entity organization structure, global cash management and raw material sourcing strategies, we determined that the functional currency of certain subsidiaries operating outside of the United States is generally the local currency of the respective subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nGains and losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than an entities' functional currency are included in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense, net.\nSales deductions\nIn certain of our end-markets, when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products to our distribution customers, we simultaneously record an adjustment to net sales for estimated rebates, sales incentives and other allowances. In our refinish end-market, risk of loss passes upon the sale to our distribution customers. Subsequent to the sale to distribution customers, when the distribution customers sell our products to collision repair body shops, additional rebates or further pricing concessions can be given to our distribution customers and certain collision repair body shops. These rebates or further pricing concessions are estimated upon the sale to the distribution customer.\nThese provisions are estimated based on historical experience, estimated future trends, estimated distribution inventory levels, current contract sales terms with our direct and indirect customers and other competitive factors. If the assumptions we used to calculate these adjustments do not appropriately reflect future activity, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected. In estimating the allowance, management considers factors such as current overall geographic and industry-specific economic conditions, statutory requirements, accounts receivable turnover, historical and anticipated customer performance, historical experience with write-offs as a standalone company and the level of past-due amounts. Changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed and local legal requirements are met, the receivable is written off against the allowance.\nContingencies\nContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, pending or threatened litigation against the Company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years.\nEnvironmental remediation costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. We accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. The extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. Our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. Adjustments to our estimates are made periodically as additional information received as remediation progresses.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. We have an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. These policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.\nFor more information on these matters, see Note 8 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "- This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the Basic Skills for Employability Programme (BSEP), being undertaken by the National Evaluation Team (NET) on behalf of the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL).\n- The purpose of the evaluation is to provide an assessment of the implementation and impact of the programme during the period 2012-15.\n- The evaluation adopted a theory-based approach using the logical framework methodology to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework; and a mixed methods approach to data collection and analysis.\n- The evaluation addressed three key questions: (1) what has BSEP achieved?; (2) to what extent has BSEP achieved its objectives?; and (3) how well has BSEP been implemented?\n- In addressing these questions, the evaluation considered the impact and effectiveness of the programme in improving basic skills among those targeted, the extent to which the programme has achieved its objectives and contributed to wider programme goals, and the efficiency of its implementation, including its cost-effectiveness.\n- The evaluation provides a range of evidence to inform the assessment of each of these dimensions, drawing on quantitative and qualitative data.", "item_7_tables": "Table 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We have over a 150-year heritage in the coatings industry and are known for manufacturing high-quality products with well-recognized brands supported by market-leading technologies and customer service. Our diverse global footprint of 49 manufacturing facilities, four technology centers, 47 customer training centers and approximately 13,300 employees allows us to meet the needs of customers in over 130 countries. We serve our customers through an extensive sales force and technical support organization, as well as through approximately 4,000 independent, locally based distributors.\nWe operate our business in two operating segments, Performance Coatings and Transportation Coatings. Our segments are based on the type and concentration of customers served, service requirements, methods of distribution and major product lines.\nThrough our Performance Coatings segment, we provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings solutions to a fragmented and local customer base. We are one of only a few suppliers with the technology to provide precise color matching and highly durable coatings systems. The end-markets within this segment are refinish and industrial.\nThrough our Transportation Coatings segment we provide advanced coating technologies to OEMs of light and commercial vehicles. These increasingly global customers require a high level of technical support coupled with cost-effective, environmentally responsible, coatings systems that can be applied with a high degree of precision, consistency and speed. The end-markets within this segment are light vehicle and commercial vehicle.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nGeneral Business Highlights\nOur net sales increased 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by impacts of acquisitions within our Performance Coatings segment. Organic volume growth in our Transportation Coatings segment was largely offset by decreases in our Performance Coatings segment, resulting in an overall increase of 0.2%, excluding acquisitions. Declines in average selling prices in our Transportation Coatings segment resulting primarily from pricing across all regions within our light vehicle end-market were offset partially by price increases in our refinish end-market, contributing to a net decrease of 1.0%. Currency translation contributed to an increase of net sales of 0.4%. The following trends have impacted our segment and end-market sales performance:\n \u2022 Performance Coatings: Net sales increased 11.5% driven by stronger volumes in our industrial end-market, including the impacts of acquisitions, combined with organic volume growth in EMEA and Asia and increases in average selling price in our refinish end-market. Performance Coatings volumes were impacted in 2017 due partially to the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations and impacts from distributor working capital adjustments in North America. \n \u2022 Transportation Coatings: Net sales increased modestly by 0.4% compared to 2016 with offsetting impacts from stronger volumes in both our light vehicle and commercial vehicle end-markets and lower average selling prices in our light vehicle end-market, primarily in North America and Asia.  Our business serves four end-markets globally as follows:\n\nAcquisitions Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we successfully completed eight strategic business acquisitions (\"2017 Acquisitions\") within our Performance Coatings segment. Included in these acquisitions was the purchase of the Industrial Wood business in North America, which is discussed in further detail at Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2017 aggregate spending for these 2017 Acquisitions was $564.4 million. The impact of acquisitions contributed $299.3 million to net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCapital and Liquidity Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which increased the aggregate principal balance of our Dollar Term Loans to $2.0 billion of which the net proceeds were used to fund the Industrial Wood Acquisition and certain other 2017 Acquisitions. In addition, this amendment extended the maturity date on our Dollar Term Loans and lowered interest rates. The benefits of this refinancing transaction are anticipated to save approximately $7.7 million in annual cash interest compared to the previous principal balances. For additional information, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Liquidity and Capital Resource discussion within this Item 7.\nOther Highlights\nIn March 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $675.0 million. We expect the share repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The pace of repurchase activity will be subject to our discretion, and will be based upon market conditions and other capital allocation decisions, while incorporating key factors including cash balances and needs of the business, cash flow from operations, stock price and acquisition opportunities. There is no expiration date on the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, repurchases totaled $58.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. TCJA legislation was enacted into law, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have assessed the impacts of the changes from the U.S. TCJA, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), and recorded a provisional net tax charge of $107.8 million. The provisionally estimated net tax charge reflects our current estimate of the new legislation's impact, which may differ with further regulatory guidance, changes in our current interpretations and assumptions and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation. For more information refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nNet sales\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our products across all major geographic areas. Our net sales include total sales less estimates for returns and price allowances. Price allowances include discounts for prompt payment as well as volume-based incentives. Our overall net sales are generally impacted by the following factors:\n \u2022 fluctuations in overall economic activity within the geographic markets in which we operate; \n \u2022 underlying growth in one or more of our end-markets, either worldwide or in particular geographies in which we operate; \n \u2022 the type of products used within existing customer applications, or the development of new applications requiring products similar to ours; \n \u2022 changes in product sales prices (including volume discounts and cash discounts for prompt payment); \n \u2022 changes in the level of competition faced by our products, including price competition and the launch of new products by competitors; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully develop and launch new products and applications; \n \u2022 changes in buying habits of our customers (including our distributors); and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  While the factors described above impact net sales in each of our operating segments, the impact of these factors on our operating segments can differ, as described below. For more information about risks relating to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business.\"\nOther revenue\nOther revenue consists primarily of consulting and other service revenue and royalty income.\nCost of goods sold (\"cost of sales\")\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the following:\n \u2022 Production materials costs. We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in production on a global lowest-cost basis. \n \u2022 Employee costs. These include the compensation and benefit costs, including share-based compensation expense, for employees involved in our manufacturing operations. These costs generally increase on an aggregate basis as production volumes increase and may decline as a percent of net sales as a result of economies of scale associated with higher production volumes. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant and equipment acquired through the Acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value on the acquisition date resulting in a new cost basis for accounting purposes. \n \u2022 Other. Our remaining cost of sales consists of freight costs, warehousing expenses, purchasing costs, costs associated with closing or idling of production facilities, functional costs supporting manufacturing, product claims and other general manufacturing expenses, such as expenses for utilities and energy consumption.  The main factors that influence our cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales include:\n \u2022 changes in the price of raw materials; \n \u2022 production volumes; \n \u2022 the implementation of cost control measures aimed at improving productivity, including reduction of fixed production costs, refinements in inventory management and the coordination of purchasing within each subsidiary and at the business level; and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Selling, general and administrative expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as technical support for our customers and administrative overhead costs, including:\n \u2022 compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, including share-based compensation expense. Expenses relating to our sales personnel increase or decrease principally with changes in sales volume due to the need to increase or decrease sales personnel to meet changes in demand. Expenses relating to administrative personnel generally do not increase or decrease directly with changes in sales volume; and \n \u2022 depreciation, advertising and other selling expenses, such as expenses incurred in connection with travel and communications.  Changes in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales have historically been impacted by a number of factors, including:\n \u2022 changes in sales volume, as higher volumes enable us to spread the fixed portion of our administrative expense over higher sales; \n \u2022 changes in our customer base, as new customers may require different levels of sales and marketing attention; \n \u2022 new product launches in existing and new markets, as these launches typically involve a more intense sales activity before they are integrated into customer applications; \n \u2022 customer credit issues requiring increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts; and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Research and development expenses\nResearch and development expense represents costs incurred to develop new products, services, processes and technologies or to generate improvements to existing products or processes.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on institutional borrowings and other financing obligations and changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments, net of capitalized interest expense. Interest expense, net also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other indebtedness.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, on various non-operational items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, historical management expenses to Carlyle (prior to the Change in Control as defined herein), indemnity gains and losses associated with the Acquisition, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses on assets that are not part of our core operational activities.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, changes to the debt and equity capitalization of our subsidiaries, and the realignment of the functions performed and risks assumed by the various subsidiaries are among the factors that will determine the future book and taxable income of the respective subsidiary and the Company as a whole.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We define our core business as those operations relating to the Company's ongoing performance and the concept is used to make resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment performance.\nEBITDA consists of net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-cash items included within net income, (ii) items the Company does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (iii) nonrecurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not occurred within the last two years or we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.\nWe believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: \n \u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Notes (as defined herein); and \n \u2022 eliminate the impact of income taxes on our results of operations; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and \n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.  We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share and other performance measures.\nIn evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items noted above.\nThe following table reconciles net income to the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures discussed above for the periods presented: \n (a) During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 we refinanced our indebtedness, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $88.0 million, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we prepaid outstanding principal on our term loans, resulting in non-cash losses on extinguishment of $0.4 million, $9.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (b) Eliminates foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impacts of our foreign currency instruments used to hedge our balance sheet exposures. Exchange effects attributable to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary represented losses of $1.8 million, $23.5 million, $51.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (c) Eliminates the non-cash, non-service components of long-term employee benefit costs. \n (d) Represents expenses primarily related to employee termination benefits and other employee-related costs associated with our Axalta Way initiatives, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (e) Represents fees paid to consultants, and associated true-ups to estimates, for professional services primarily related to our Axalta Way initiatives, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (f) Represents integration costs related to the 2017 acquisition of the Industrial Wood business that was a carve-out business from Valspar and changes in estimates associated with the transition from DuPont to a standalone entity, including certain Acquisition indemnities. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (g) Represents acquisition-related expenses, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as $10.0 million of costs associated with contemplated merger activities during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and costs associated with the 2016 secondary offerings of our common shares by Carlyle, all of which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (h) Represents non-cash costs associated with stock-based compensation, including $8.2 million of expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 attributable to the accelerated vesting of all issued and outstanding stock options issued under the 2013 Plan. This acceleration was the result of a change in control that occurred in conjunction with Carlyle's ownership interest falling below 50% and triggering a liquidity event (\"Change in Control\"). \n (i) Represents costs for certain non-operational or non-cash (gains) and losses unrelated to our core business and which we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations, including equity investee dividends, indemnity losses (gains) associated with the Acquisition, losses (gains) on sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment, losses (gains) on the remaining foreign currency derivative instruments, Carlyle management fees incurred prior to the Change in Control and non-cash fair value inventory adjustments associated with our business combinations. \n (j) Represents the payment of dividends to our joint venture partners by our consolidated entities that are not 100% owned, which are reflected to show the cash operating performance of these entities on Axalta's financial statements. \n (k) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss in conjunction with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $70.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded non-cash impairments at our Venezuelan subsidiary of $68.4 million and $30.6 million, respectively, associated with our operational long-lived assets and a real estate investment (See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to certain manufacturing facilities previously announced for closure of $7.6 million. We do not consider these to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations set forth below may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table was derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $284.1 million, or 7.0%, to $4,352.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $4,068.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 included the benefits of acquisitions which contributed to an increase in net sales of 7.4%. Further contributing to this sales growth was an increase in organic sales volumes in our commercial vehicle and industrial end-markets, which was largely offset by declines in our refinish end-market, particularly within Latin America and North America, resulting in a net increase of 0.2%. Lower average sales prices contributed to a 1.0% decrease driven primarily by declines in our Transportation Coatings segment. Net sales were also impacted by favorable impacts of currency translation, which increased net sales by 0.4%, due primarily to the impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar which were slightly offset by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting from the favorable impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales increased $252.0 million, or 10.0%, to $2,779.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of 7.6%, inclusive of impacts of acquisitions. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro against the U.S. dollar offset partially by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar, which contributed to a 0.5% increase. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of lower average selling prices and raw material inflation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.2 million, or 3.7%, to $997.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from the impacts of acquisitions of $48.6 million as well as our focus on opportunities to expand our market presence and invest in commercial capabilities.\nFurthering this increase was unfavorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2017, which contributed to an approximate 0.6% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our Axalta Way cost savings initiatives and acquisition-related costs which were $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $77.6 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an $13.8 million decrease over the comparable period.\nVenezuela asset impairment and deconsolidation charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $70.9 million in conjunction with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge for $57.9 million relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. See further discussion in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.6 million, or 13.2%, to $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of additional spend as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products, as well as the impacts from acquisitions of $9.1 million. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro and certain currencies in Latin America against the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease resulting from the impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $17.8 million, or 21.3%, to $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was attributable to the amortization of the definite-lived intangible assets from our acquisitions, as well as a $1.7 million of impairment related to abandoned in-process research and development intangible assets. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $31.2 million, or 17.5%, to $147.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by the refinancing of our indebtedness during 2016 and 2017 which reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio, partially offset by increases resulting from the incremental indebtedness used to finance the Industrial Wood Acquisition.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased $117.0 million, or 82.0%, to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to the decrease in losses on debt extinguishment and refinancing related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 which resulted in an $84.2 million decrease over the comparable period.\nIn addition, there was a reduction in foreign exchange losses, net from $30.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a $23.2 million decrease over the comparable period. Prior to deconsolidation, our Venezuela subsidiary contributed $1.8 million and $23.5 million in foreign exchange losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFurthering this decrease was a $2.9 million decrease in impairments to $7.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with impairments related to the manufacturing facilities closures, compared to the impairment of $10.5 million related to our real estate investment in Venezuela incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $141.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 74.8% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $189.6 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 39.8%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $56.2 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.1 million and $17.7 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. Furthermore, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $26.8 million related to the tax basis in our deconsolidated Venezuelan subsidiary, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance as we do not expect to realize the benefits. In addition, a pre-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $70.9 million had an unfavorable impact of $24.8 million as it was nondeductible. The impact of the U.S. TCJA (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) resulted in a tax charge of $107.8 million primarily as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and impact on certain tax attributes. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $45.3 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $14.4 million and the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 million negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table was derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nNet sales\nNet sales decreased $15.1 million, or 0.4%, to $4,068.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $4,083.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to unfavorable impacts of currency translation, which reduced net sales by 4.6% due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia compared to the U.S. dollar. This net sales decline was partially offset by higher average selling prices across both our segments, primarily in Latin America, which contributed to an increase of 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Increases in volumes across both our segments, in Europe, Asia and North America, attributable mainly to a 2.2% increase from our acquisitions, also contributed to net sales growth of 1.7%.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily related to declines in service revenue combined with the impacts of weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, which caused a decrease of $0.8 million, or 3.1%.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased $69.7 million, or 2.7%, to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2,597.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 2.1% decrease associated with currency translation due to the impact of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America, Asia and Europe. The decrease from currency translation was slightly offset by the contribution of higher volumes of 1.7% which includes impacts of our acquisitions completed during 2016. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of reductions associated with lower raw material prices, favorable pricing on our product mix and impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 5.2%, to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $914.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $77.6 million of costs related to our cost-savings initiatives as compared to $64.4 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with our transition-related activities and cost-savings initiatives, resulting in an increase of $13.2 million over the comparable period. In addition, there was an increase of $8.0 million in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further contributing to the increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period were increases in selling expense associated with increased sales volumes and $17.5 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting these increases were favorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2016, which contributed to an approximately 1.7% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nVenezuela asset impairment\nVenezuela asset impairment relates to the impairment charge of $57.9 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. There was no comparative impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.1 million, or 11.8%, to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was driven by additional spending as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $2.7 million, or 3.3%, to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was a result of our recent acquisitions, which contributed $3.5 million, offset slightly by the impacts of weakening currencies in all regions against the U.S. dollar.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $18.3 million, or 9.3%, to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was driven by the prepayment of principal balances associated with our 2020 Dollar Term Loans made in 2015 and 2016 and the prepayment on the principal balance of our 2020 Euro Term Loans made in 2016. Additionally, refinancing of our senior indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016, reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio and further contributed to the decrease.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased $31.5 million, or 28.3%, to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amendment to our Credit Agreement, refinancing of our indebtedness and prepayments of our Term Loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in other expense over the comparable period of $95.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 there were $4.3 million in losses on derivative instruments associated with our foreign currency contracts compared to $5.6 million in gains during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in a $9.9 million increase. In addition, we recognized a gain of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held interest in an equity method investee upon the acquisition of a controlling interest whereas no similar gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016, thereby resulting in an increase in other expense, net for the comparable periods.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our Venezuelan subsidiary continued to be impacted by a significant devaluation of its currency translation rates. This devaluation resulted in impairment charges of $10.5 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on our evaluation of the carrying value associated with our real estate investment, resulting in a decrease of $20.1 million over the comparable period.\nOffsetting the year over year loss, foreign exchange losses, net, decreased from $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of our Venezuela subsidiary which resulted in $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining decrease primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany transactional exposures denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a 39.3% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $157.9 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 4.3%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to China, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands, which had a net favorable impact of $41.4 million. Additionally, $10.5 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charge in Venezuela of $30.6 million which had an unfavorable $10.7 million impact on the effective rate as it was nondeductible, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $34.4 million, and the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $10.4 million.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\n\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $276.6 million, or 11.5%, to $2,675.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by increased volumes of 10.7%. This included a 12.0% benefit from acquisitions and organic volume decreases, which were comprised of industrial end-market increases more than offset by decreases in our refinish end-market driven by distributor working capital adjustments in North America, as well as the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations. Higher average selling prices contributed to an increase of 0.5%, and favorable impacts of currency exchange primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar contributed to a 0.3% increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $14.5 million, or 2.6%, to $564.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by impacts of acquisitions and higher average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of higher variable costs across all regions and end-markets.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $7.5 million, or 0.4%, to $1,677.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by an increase in sales volumes which contributed to growth of 3.0%. This included organic volume increases in both end-markets as well as a 0.7% benefit from acquisitions. Further contributing to the increase was the favorable impacts of currency exchange related to strengthening of the Euro and certain currencies in Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar which contributed to a 0.5% increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increases were lower average selling prices across both end-markets contributing to a 3.1% decrease.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $31.7 million, or 9.0%, to $321.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by lower average selling prices and higher variable costs in our light vehicle end-market, partially offset by volume growth across both end-markets.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\n\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $16.7 million, or 0.7%, to $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $2,381.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of higher average selling prices and volumes which contributed 3.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Contributions from price included a stronger product mix which was driven by our North America and Latin America regions. Volume growth in both our refinish and industrial end-markets included a 3.2% benefit from our acquisitions, slightly offset by the negative volume contribution from Latin America. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 5.8% reduction in net sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $13.9 million, or 2.6%, to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $535.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices, primarily in our refinish end-market, increases in sales volumes in both end-markets combined with lower variable costs across all regions and the impacts related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting this increase were unfavorable impacts of currency exchange across all regions, due mainly to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales decreased $31.8 million, or 1.9%, to 1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $1,702.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 3.0% reduction in net sales. Offsetting the decline in net sales was a 1.0% increase in average selling prices primarily driven by Latin America. Volume of 0.1% was driven by strong performances in North America and Asia, including a 0.7% impact from acquisitions, which was largely offset by weaker volumes in Latin America.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $24.6 million, or 7.5%, to $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and lower variable costs. This increase was partially offset by higher operating costs combined with the unfavorable impacts of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nAt December 31, 2017, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $364.5 million, net of $35.5 million of letters of credit outstanding. All such availability may be utilized without violating any covenants under the credit agreement governing such facility or the indentures governing the New Senior Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had $13.1 million of outstanding borrowings under other lines of credit. Our remaining available borrowing capacity under other lines of credit in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions totaled $5.1 million.\nWe or our affiliates, at any time and from time to time, may purchase shares of our common stock, the New Senior Notes or other indebtedness. Any such purchases may be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more redemption, tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we, or any of our affiliates, may determine.\nCash Flows\nYears ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $540.0 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of $626.1 million. This was partially offset by uses of working capital of $86.1 million. The most significant drivers in working capital were increases in accounts receivables of $15.2 million, inventory of $19.9 million and other assets of $84.9 million. These were primarily caused by incremental net sales, increased inventory builds to support ongoing operational demands and upfront customer incentive payments during the year ended December 31, 2017. Other uses were due to a reduction in other liabilities of $12.6 million related to payments of normal operating activities, offset by increases in accounts payable of $39.8 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $689.6 million. This use was driven by business acquisitions of $564.4 million (net of cash acquired),", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

The end-markets within this segment are refinish and industrial.\nThrough our Transportation Coatings segment we provide advanced coating technologies to OEMs of light and commercial vehicles. These increasingly global customers require a high level of technical support coupled with cost-effective, environmentally responsible, coatings systems that can be applied with a high degree of precision, consistency and speed. The end-markets within this segment are light vehicle and commercial vehicle.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nGeneral Business Highlights\nOur net sales increased 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by impacts of acquisitions within our Performance Coatings segment. Organic volume growth in our Transportation Coatings segment was largely offset by decreases in our Performance Coatings segment, resulting in an overall increase of 0.2%, excluding acquisitions. Declines in average selling prices in our Transportation Coatings segment resulting primarily from pricing across all regions within our light vehicle end-market were offset partially by price increases in our refinish end-market, contributing to a net decrease of 1.0%. Currency translation contributed to an increase of net sales of 0.4%. The following trends have impacted our segment and end-market sales performance:\n \u2022 Performance Coatings: Net sales increased 11.5% driven by stronger volumes in our industrial end-market, including the impacts of acquisitions, combined with organic volume growth in EMEA and Asia and increases in average selling price in our refinish end-market. Performance Coatings volumes were impacted in 2017 due partially to the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations and impacts from distributor working capital adjustments in North America. \n \u2022 Transportation Coatings: Net sales increased modestly by 0.4% compared to 2016 with offsetting impacts from stronger volumes in both our light vehicle and commercial vehicle end-markets and lower average selling prices in our light vehicle end-market, primarily in North America and Asia.  Our business serves four end-markets globally as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Refinish\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,645.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,679.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,698.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>1,029.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>2,675.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,381.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Light Vehicle\n</td> <td>1,322.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,337.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Vehicle\n</td> <td>355.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,677.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,352.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we successfully completed eight strategic business acquisitions (\"2017 Acquisitions\") within our Performance Coatings segment. Included in these acquisitions was the purchase of the Industrial Wood business in North America, which is discussed in further detail at Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2017 aggregate spending for these 2017 Acquisitions was $564.4 million. The impact of acquisitions contributed $299.3 million to net sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCapital and Liquidity Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which increased the aggregate principal balance of our Dollar Term Loans to $2.0 billion of which the net proceeds were used to fund the Industrial Wood Acquisition and certain other 2017 Acquisitions. In addition, this amendment extended the maturity date on our Dollar Term Loans and lowered interest rates. The benefits of this refinancing transaction are anticipated to save approximately $7.7 million in annual cash interest compared to the previous principal balances. For additional information, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Liquidity and Capital Resource discussion within this Item 7.\nOther Highlights\nIn March 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $675.0 million. We expect the share repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The pace of repurchase activity will be subject to our discretion, and will be based upon market conditions and other capital allocation decisions, while incorporating key factors including cash balances and needs of the business, cash flow from operations, stock price and acquisition opportunities. There is no expiration date on the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, repurchases totaled $58.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. TCJA legislation was enacted into law, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have assessed the impacts of the changes from the U.S. TCJA, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), and recorded a provisional net tax charge of $107.8 million. The provisionally estimated net tax charge reflects our current estimate of the new legislation's impact, which may differ with further regulatory guidance, changes in our current interpretations and assumptions and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation. For more information refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Results\nThe following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.\nNet sales\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our products across all major geographic areas. Our net sales include total sales less estimates for returns and price allowances. Price allowances include discounts for prompt payment as well as volume-based incentives. Our overall net sales are generally impacted by the following factors:\n \u2022 fluctuations in overall economic activity within the geographic markets in which we operate; \n \u2022 underlying growth in one or more of our end-markets, either worldwide or in particular geographies in which we operate; \n \u2022 the type of products used within existing customer applications, or the development of new applications requiring products similar to ours; \n \u2022 changes in product sales prices (including volume discounts and cash discounts for prompt payment); \n \u2022 changes in the level of competition faced by our products, including price competition and the launch of new products by competitors; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully develop and launch new products and applications; \n \u2022 changes in buying habits of our customers (including our distributors); and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  While the factors described above impact net sales in each of our operating segments, the impact of these factors on our operating segments can differ, as described below. For more information about risks relating to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business.\"\nOther revenue\nOther revenue consists primarily of consulting and other service revenue and royalty income.\nCost of goods sold (\"cost of sales\")\nOur cost of sales consists principally of the following:\n \u2022 Production materials costs. We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in production on a global lowest-cost basis. \n \u2022 Employee costs. These include the compensation and benefit costs, including share-based compensation expense, for employees involved in our manufacturing operations. These costs generally increase on an aggregate basis as production volumes increase and may decline as a percent of net sales as a result of economies of scale associated with higher production volumes. \n \u2022 Depreciation expense. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant and equipment acquired through the Acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value on the acquisition date resulting in a new cost basis for accounting purposes. \n \u2022 Other. Our remaining cost of sales consists of freight costs, warehousing expenses, purchasing costs, costs associated with closing or idling of production facilities, functional costs supporting manufacturing, product claims and other general manufacturing expenses, such as expenses for utilities and energy consumption.  The main factors that influence our cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales include:\n \u2022 changes in the price of raw materials; \n \u2022 production volumes; \n \u2022 the implementation of cost control measures aimed at improving productivity, including reduction of fixed production costs, refinements in inventory management and the coordination of purchasing within each subsidiary and at the business level; and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Selling, general and administrative expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as technical support for our customers and administrative overhead costs, including:\n \u2022 compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, including share-based compensation expense. Expenses relating to our sales personnel increase or decrease principally with changes in sales volume due to the need to increase or decrease sales personnel to meet changes in demand. Expenses relating to administrative personnel generally do not increase or decrease directly with changes in sales volume; and \n \u2022 depreciation, advertising and other selling expenses, such as expenses incurred in connection with travel and communications.  Changes in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales have historically been impacted by a number of factors, including:\n \u2022 changes in sales volume, as higher volumes enable us to spread the fixed portion of our administrative expense over higher sales; \n \u2022 changes in our customer base, as new customers may require different levels of sales and marketing attention; \n \u2022 new product launches in existing and new markets, as these launches typically involve a more intense sales activity before they are integrated into customer applications; \n \u2022 customer credit issues requiring increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts; and \n \u2022 fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Research and development expenses\nResearch and development expense represents costs incurred to develop new products, services, processes and technologies or to generate improvements to existing products or processes.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on institutional borrowings and other financing obligations and changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments, net of capitalized interest expense. Interest expense, net also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other indebtedness.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net represents costs incurred, net of income, on various non-operational items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, historical management expenses to Carlyle (prior to the Change in Control as defined herein), indemnity gains and losses associated with the Acquisition, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses on assets that are not part of our core operational activities.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, changes to the debt and equity capitalization of our subsidiaries, and the realignment of the functions performed and risks assumed by the various subsidiaries are among the factors that will determine the future book and taxable income of the respective subsidiary and the Company as a whole.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We define our core business as those operations relating to the Company's ongoing performance and the concept is used to make resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment performance.\nEBITDA consists of net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-cash items included within net income, (ii) items the Company does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (iii) nonrecurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not occurred within the last two years or we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.\nWe believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: \n \u2022 do not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New Senior Notes (as defined herein); and \n \u2022 eliminate the impact of income taxes on our results of operations; \n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and \n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.  We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share and other performance measures.\nIn evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items noted above.\nThe following table reconciles net income to the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures discussed above for the periods presented: Table 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>147.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>141.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>684.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>583.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment and refinancing related costs (a)\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange remeasurement losses (b)\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term employee benefit plan adjustments (c)\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Termination benefits and other employee related costs (d)\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting and advisory fees (e)\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition-related costs (f)\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offering and transactional costs (g)\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation (h)\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (i)\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends in respect of noncontrolling interest (j)\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deconsolidation impacts and impairments (k)\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 we refinanced our indebtedness, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $88.0 million, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we prepaid outstanding principal on our term loans, resulting in non-cash losses on extinguishment of $0.4 million, $9.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (b) Eliminates foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impacts of our foreign currency instruments used to hedge our balance sheet exposures. Exchange effects attributable to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary represented losses of $1.8 million, $23.5 million, $51.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (c) Eliminates the non-cash, non-service components of long-term employee benefit costs. \n (d) Represents expenses primarily related to employee termination benefits and other employee-related costs associated with our Axalta Way initiatives, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (e) Represents fees paid to consultants, and associated true-ups to estimates, for professional services primarily related to our Axalta Way initiatives, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (f) Represents integration costs related to the 2017 acquisition of the Industrial Wood business that was a carve-out business from Valspar and changes in estimates associated with the transition from DuPont to a standalone entity, including certain Acquisition indemnities. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (g) Represents acquisition-related expenses, including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as $10.0 million of costs associated with contemplated merger activities during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and costs associated with the 2016 secondary offerings of our common shares by Carlyle, all of which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \n (h) Represents non-cash costs associated with stock-based compensation, including $8.2 million of expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 attributable to the accelerated vesting of all issued and outstanding stock options issued under the 2013 Plan. This acceleration was the result of a change in control that occurred in conjunction with Carlyle's ownership interest falling below 50% and triggering a liquidity event (\"Change in Control\"). \n (i) Represents costs for certain non-operational or non-cash (gains) and losses unrelated to our core business and which we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations, including equity investee dividends, indemnity losses (gains) associated with the Acquisition, losses (gains) on sale and disposal of property, plant and equipment, losses (gains) on the remaining foreign currency derivative instruments, Carlyle management fees incurred prior to the Change in Control and non-cash fair value inventory adjustments associated with our business combinations. \n (j) Represents the payment of dividends to our joint venture partners by our consolidated entities that are not 100% owned, which are reflected to show the cash operating performance of these entities on Axalta's financial statements. \n (k) During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss in conjunction with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $70.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded non-cash impairments at our Venezuelan subsidiary of $68.4 million and $30.6 million, respectively, associated with our operational long-lived assets and a real estate investment (See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to certain manufacturing facilities previously announced for closure of $7.6 million. We do not consider these to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results of operations set forth below may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table was derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,352.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>4,377.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,092.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>2,779.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>997.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>962.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela asset impairment and deconsolidation charge\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles\n</td> <td>101.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>362.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>147.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>189.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>141.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $284.1 million, or 7.0%, to $4,352.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $4,068.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 included the benefits of acquisitions which contributed to an increase in net sales of 7.4%. Further contributing to this sales growth was an increase in organic sales volumes in our commercial vehicle and industrial end-markets, which was largely offset by declines in our refinish end-market, particularly within Latin America and North America, resulting in a net increase of 0.2%. Lower average sales prices contributed to a 1.0% decrease driven primarily by declines in our Transportation Coatings segment. Net sales were also impacted by favorable impacts of currency translation, which increased net sales by 0.4%, due primarily to the impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar which were slightly offset by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulting from the favorable impacts of the strengthening Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales increased $252.0 million, or 10.0%, to $2,779.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of 7.6%, inclusive of impacts of acquisitions. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro against the U.S. dollar offset partially by the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia against the U.S. dollar, which contributed to a 0.5% increase. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of lower average selling prices and raw material inflation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.2 million, or 3.7%, to $997.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from the impacts of acquisitions of $48.6 million as well as our focus on opportunities to expand our market presence and invest in commercial capabilities.\nFurthering this increase was unfavorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2017, which contributed to an approximate 0.6% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our Axalta Way cost savings initiatives and acquisition-related costs which were $63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $77.6 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an $13.8 million decrease over the comparable period.\nVenezuela asset impairment and deconsolidation charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $70.9 million in conjunction with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge for $57.9 million relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. See further discussion in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $7.6 million, or 13.2%, to $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was a result of additional spend as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products, as well as the impacts from acquisitions of $9.1 million. Furthering this increase were unfavorable effects of currency translation resulting from the impacts of the strengthening Euro and certain currencies in Latin America against the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease resulting from the impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $17.8 million, or 21.3%, to $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was attributable to the amortization of the definite-lived intangible assets from our acquisitions, as well as a $1.7 million of impairment related to abandoned in-process research and development intangible assets. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $31.2 million, or 17.5%, to $147.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by the refinancing of our indebtedness during 2016 and 2017 which reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio, partially offset by increases resulting from the incremental indebtedness used to finance the Industrial Wood Acquisition.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased $117.0 million, or 82.0%, to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease relates primarily to the decrease in losses on debt extinguishment and refinancing related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 which resulted in an $84.2 million decrease over the comparable period.\nIn addition, there was a reduction in foreign exchange losses, net from $30.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a $23.2 million decrease over the comparable period. Prior to deconsolidation, our Venezuela subsidiary contributed $1.8 million and $23.5 million in foreign exchange losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFurthering this decrease was a $2.9 million decrease in impairments to $7.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with impairments related to the manufacturing facilities closures, compared to the impairment of $10.5 million related to our real estate investment in Venezuela incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $141.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 74.8% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $189.6 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 39.8%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $56.2 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.1 million and $17.7 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. Furthermore, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $26.8 million related to the tax basis in our deconsolidated Venezuelan subsidiary, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance as we do not expect to realize the benefits. In addition, a pre-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $70.9 million had an unfavorable impact of $24.8 million as it was nondeductible. The impact of the U.S. TCJA (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) resulted in a tax charge of $107.8 million primarily as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and impact on certain tax attributes. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $45.3 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $14.4 million and the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 million negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland, which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table was derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>4,092.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,110.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>2,527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,597.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>962.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>914.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela asset impairment\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles\n</td> <td>83.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>403.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>178.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>142.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>82.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to controlling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales\nNet sales decreased $15.1 million, or 0.4%, to $4,068.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $4,083.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to unfavorable impacts of currency translation, which reduced net sales by 4.6% due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America and Asia compared to the U.S. dollar. This net sales decline was partially offset by higher average selling prices across both our segments, primarily in Latin America, which contributed to an increase of 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Increases in volumes across both our segments, in Europe, Asia and North America, attributable mainly to a 2.2% increase from our acquisitions, also contributed to net sales growth of 1.7%.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily related to declines in service revenue combined with the impacts of weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, which caused a decrease of $0.8 million, or 3.1%.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased $69.7 million, or 2.7%, to $2,527.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2,597.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from a 2.1% decrease associated with currency translation due to the impact of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America, Asia and Europe. The decrease from currency translation was slightly offset by the contribution of higher volumes of 1.7% which includes impacts of our acquisitions completed during 2016. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 62.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of reductions associated with lower raw material prices, favorable pricing on our product mix and impacts of our cost savings initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million, or 5.2%, to $962.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $914.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $77.6 million of costs related to our cost-savings initiatives as compared to $64.4 million of costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with our transition-related activities and cost-savings initiatives, resulting in an increase of $13.2 million over the comparable period. In addition, there was an increase of $8.0 million in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further contributing to the increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period were increases in selling expense associated with increased sales volumes and $17.5 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting these increases were favorable impacts of currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2016, which contributed to an approximately 1.7% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due primarily to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nVenezuela asset impairment\nVenezuela asset impairment relates to the impairment charge of $57.9 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 relating to our long-lived assets within our Venezuelan subsidiary. There was no comparative impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.1 million, or 11.8%, to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was driven by additional spending as we focus on developing new and existing coatings products. The impacts of currency exchange did not have a material impact on the comparable periods.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased $2.7 million, or 3.3%, to $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was a result of our recent acquisitions, which contributed $3.5 million, offset slightly by the impacts of weakening currencies in all regions against the U.S. dollar.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased $18.3 million, or 9.3%, to $178.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was driven by the prepayment of principal balances associated with our 2020 Dollar Term Loans made in 2015 and 2016 and the prepayment on the principal balance of our 2020 Euro Term Loans made in 2016. Additionally, refinancing of our senior indebtedness during the year ended December 31, 2016, reduced the overall interest rates of our debt portfolio and further contributed to the decrease.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased $31.5 million, or 28.3%, to $142.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amendment to our Credit Agreement, refinancing of our indebtedness and prepayments of our Term Loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in other expense over the comparable period of $95.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 there were $4.3 million in losses on derivative instruments associated with our foreign currency contracts compared to $5.6 million in gains during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in a $9.9 million increase. In addition, we recognized a gain of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held interest in an equity method investee upon the acquisition of a controlling interest whereas no similar gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016, thereby resulting in an increase in other expense, net for the comparable periods.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our Venezuelan subsidiary continued to be impacted by a significant devaluation of its currency translation rates. This devaluation resulted in impairment charges of $10.5 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, based on our evaluation of the carrying value associated with our real estate investment, resulting in a decrease of $20.1 million over the comparable period.\nOffsetting the year over year loss, foreign exchange losses, net, decreased from $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of our Venezuela subsidiary which resulted in $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining decrease primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany transactional exposures denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 46.1% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $82.7 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 11.1%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to Bermuda, China, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland which had a net favorable impact of $45.6 million. Additionally, current year excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $13.4 million favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charges in Venezuela of $68.4 million related to the impairment of operational assets as well as a non-operating real estate investment which had an unfavorable impact of $23.8 million on the effective rate as it was nondeductible. Lastly, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $9.6 million, the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $11.4 million, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $7.1 million and $3.1 million associated with currency exchange losses negatively impacted the effective rate.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a 39.3% effective tax rate in relation to the income before income taxes of $157.9 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate by 4.3%, which is the result of various items that impacted the rate both favorably and unfavorably. We generated earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal rate, primarily related to China, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands, which had a net favorable impact of $41.4 million. Additionally, $10.5 million associated with currency exchange losses favorably impacted the effective rate. These adjustments were offset by the pre-tax impairment charge in Venezuela of $30.6 million which had an unfavorable $10.7 million impact on the effective rate as it was nondeductible, the unfavorable impact of pre-tax losses attributable to jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be realized of $34.4 million, and the impact of non-deductible expenses and interest of $10.4 million.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,675.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,677.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,352.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>321.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $276.6 million, or 11.5%, to $2,675.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by increased volumes of 10.7%. This included a 12.0% benefit from acquisitions and organic volume decreases, which were comprised of industrial end-market increases more than offset by decreases in our refinish end-market driven by distributor working capital adjustments in North America, as well as the absence of our now deconsolidated Venezuelan operations. Higher average selling prices contributed to an increase of 0.5%, and favorable impacts of currency exchange primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar contributed to a 0.3% increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $14.5 million, or 2.6%, to $564.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by impacts of acquisitions and higher average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of higher variable costs across all regions and end-markets.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $7.5 million, or 0.4%, to $1,677.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net sales of $1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by an increase in sales volumes which contributed to growth of 3.0%. This included organic volume increases in both end-markets as well as a 0.7% benefit from acquisitions. Further contributing to the increase was the favorable impacts of currency exchange related to strengthening of the Euro and certain currencies in Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar which contributed to a 0.5% increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increases were lower average selling prices across both end-markets contributing to a 3.1% decrease.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $31.7 million, or 9.0%, to $321.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by lower average selling prices and higher variable costs in our light vehicle end-market, partially offset by volume growth across both end-markets.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and segment Adjusted EBITDA for the following periods:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,398.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,381.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>1,670.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,068.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Coatings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation Coatings\n</td> <td>352.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>902.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Coatings Segment\nNet sales increased $16.7 million, or 0.7%, to $2,398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $2,381.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was a result of higher average selling prices and volumes which contributed 3.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Contributions from price included a stronger product mix which was driven by our North America and Latin America regions. Volume growth in both our refinish and industrial end-markets included a 3.2% benefit from our acquisitions, slightly offset by the negative volume contribution from Latin America. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 5.8% reduction in net sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $13.9 million, or 2.6%, to $549.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $535.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices, primarily in our refinish end-market, increases in sales volumes in both end-markets combined with lower variable costs across all regions and the impacts related to our recent acquisitions. Offsetting this increase were unfavorable impacts of currency exchange across all regions, due mainly to the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nTransportation Coatings Segment\nNet sales decreased $31.8 million, or 1.9%, to 1,670.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net sales of $1,702.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by unfavorable impacts of weakening currencies across all regions, which contributed to a 3.0% reduction in net sales. Offsetting the decline in net sales was a 1.0% increase in average selling prices primarily driven by Latin America. Volume of 0.1% was driven by strong performances in North America and Asia, including a 0.7% impact from acquisitions, which was largely offset by weaker volumes in Latin America.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $24.6 million, or 7.5%, to $352.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $328.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and lower variable costs. This increase was partially offset by higher operating costs combined with the unfavorable impacts of the weakening of certain currencies within Latin America compared to the U.S. dollar.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nAt December 31, 2017, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $364.5 million, net of $35.5 million of letters of credit outstanding. All such availability may be utilized without violating any covenants under the credit agreement governing such facility or the indentures governing the New Senior Notes.

Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of $626.1 million. This was partially offset by uses of working capital of $86.1 million. The most significant drivers in working capital were increases in accounts receivables of $15.2 million, inventory of $19.9 million and other assets of $84.9 million. These were primarily caused by incremental net sales, increased inventory builds to support ongoing operational demands and upfront customer incentive payments during the year ended December 31, 2017. Other uses were due to a reduction in other liabilities of $12.6 million related to payments of normal operating activities, offset by increases in accounts payable of $39.8 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $689.6 million. This use was driven by business acquisitions of $564.4 million (net of cash acquired),"}
