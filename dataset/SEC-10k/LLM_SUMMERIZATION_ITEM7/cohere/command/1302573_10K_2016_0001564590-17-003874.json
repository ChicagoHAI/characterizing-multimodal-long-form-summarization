We believe that a key reason for the limitations of many current cancer treatments is that they fail to impede the growth of cancer stem cells, or CSCs, which are responsible for the initiation, metastasis and recurrence of many cancers. Our research into CSC pathways such as Notch, Wnt and RSPO-LGR, has also led us to identify immuno-oncology biologics intended to bolster immune system recognition of cancer cells and/or suppress immune system evasion mechanisms. We believe our therapeutic candidates are quite distinct from current generations of chemotherapies and targeted therapies, and have the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer. All of our therapeutic candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories.\nWe currently have eight therapeutic candidates currently in clinical development targeting CSC pathways and immuno-oncology, including our most recent Investigational New Drug, or IND, filing for our anti-TIGIT program. We are also pursuing discovery of additional novel approaches to cancer treatment including new immuno-oncology therapeutic candidates. Our first therapeutic candidate in the clinic, demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18), is currently being studied in three trials: a randomized Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer, a randomized Phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and a Phase Ib trial combining demcizumab and prembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae). Demcizumab has received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from the FDA. The second candidate, tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), is currently in a randomized Phase II clinical trial known as PINNACLE\u201d in combination with platinum chemotherapy and etoposide in small cell lung cancer patients. In January 2016, we discontinued a second Phase II trial of tarextumab in combination with Abraxane\u00ae and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients. In January 2015, tarextumab received orphan drug designation from the FDA for both pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. With respect to the third candidate, vantictumab (anti-Fzd,\nOMP-18R5), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib clinical trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapies in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Regarding the fourth candidate, ipafricept (Fzd8-Fc, OMP-54F28), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib trials of ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies, one in pancreatic cancer and the second in ovarian cancer. The fifth therapeutic candidate, navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), is currently in a single-agent Phase Ia trial that is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, and we have initiated two Phase Ib clinical trials of navicixizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. Regarding the sixth candidate, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10), we are currently enrolling patients in both portions of a Phase Ia/b clinical trial. The Phase Ia portion is in solid tumor patients and the Phase Ib portion is in patients with certain colorectal or gastric cancers and combines anti-RSPO3 with standard-of-care chemotherapy. The seventh candidate, brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51), is currently being studied in a Phase Ib clinical trial in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf\u00ae) in colorectal cancer patients. Our IND submission with the FDA for our eighth therapeutic candidate, anti-TIGIT (OMP-313M32) has been cleared and we expect to begin enrolling patients in a Phase Ia clinical trial for anti-TIGIT during the first half of 2017. Clinical trials for all eight of these therapeutic candidates are ongoing, with the intent of gathering additional data required to proceed to later stage clinical trials and product approval. We plan to file an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our ninth therapeutic candidate, GITRL-Fc (OMP-336B11), in the first half of 2017.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from upfront payments and development milestones received from GSK, Bayer and Celgene. We recognize revenue from upfront payments ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreements. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives or the exercise of options for specified programs by our strategic partners. Such payments are recorded as revenue when we achieve the underlying milestone if there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved. We also recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which is related to the recognition of upfront payments, milestone payments and reimbursements of research and development costs under our various collaboration arrangements:\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GSK:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GSK total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bayer:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bayer total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Celgene:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Celgene total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments from our collaborations with GSK, Bayer and Celgene or any new collaboration we may enter in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research such as the discovery and development of clinical candidates for GSK, Bayer and Celgene as well as discovery and development of our proprietary unpartnered therapeutic candidates. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of employee salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, third-party contract costs relating to research, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trial activities, laboratory consumables, and allocated facility costs.\nAt any point in time, we typically have various early stage research and drug discovery projects. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery project and are typically deployed across multiple projects. As such, we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these early stage research and drug discovery programs on a project-specific basis.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The internal costs include personnel, facility costs, laboratory consumables and discovery and research related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party contract costs relating to manufacturing, clinical trial activities, translational medicine and toxicology activities.\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internal Costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cancer biology, pathology and toxicology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Molecular and cellular biology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Process development and manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal internal costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External Program Costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Translational medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toxicology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal external program costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur research and development expenses have increased as we have progressed our therapeutic candidates, and we expect that these expenses may continue to increase with continued pipeline advancement and conduct of our development activities under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success of each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nFor the biologic programs covered under our strategic alliances with GSK, Bayer and Celgene, we are responsible for development of each therapeutic candidate prior to the exercise of GSK's, Bayer's or Celgene's option to exclusively license such therapeutic candidate. GSK may exercise such an option on a product-by-product basis, Bayer may exercise such an option on a class-by-class basis, and Celgene may exercise such option on a program-by-program basis, in each case, during certain time periods, which for GSK, Bayer and Celgene are\nthrough the end of certain Phase I or Phase II trials, depending on the applicable therapeutic candidate or program. If GSK exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all further development obligations for such therapeutic candidate are assumed by GSK. If Bayer exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all development obligations for such therapeutic candidate after such therapeutic candidate reaches a defined early development stage are assumed by Bayer. With respect to biologic therapeutic programs, if Celgene exercises its option for a given program, we will have the option to co-develop and co-commercialize up to five of the six such therapeutic candidates in the United States. If we do so, we will be responsible for a one-third share of the global development costs of such therapeutic candidates, with Celgene bearing the remaining two-thirds of such costs, and we will be entitled to participate in the commercialization activities for such therapeutic candidates in the United States, and to share 50% of all profits and losses arising from U.S. sales of such therapeutic candidates. Otherwise, we may enter into a license agreement with Celgene for such therapeutic candidate whereupon Celgene would be responsible for all further development costs. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option under the Celgene Agreement to further develop and commercialize small molecule therapeutics directed to targets in an undisclosed pathway, all further development obligations with respect to the small molecule therapeutic program will be assumed by Celgene.\nMost of our product development programs are at an early stage; therefore, the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. Given the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates or if and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates. We anticipate that we and our strategic alliance partners will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, as well as an ongoing assessment as to each therapeutic candidate's commercial potential. We may need to raise additional capital or may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to complete the development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment and other expenses for outside professional services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, human resource, audit, tax and accounting services and other consulting costs.\nSince becoming a public company in 2013, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses required of public companies, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Other related public company costs include increased expenses for additional insurance, investor relations and other needs for human resources and professional services.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest income consists primarily of interest received on our cash and short-term investments balances.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a tax expense of $14,000 and $20,000, respectively, due to interest on uncertain tax positions. We did not record an income tax provision on pre-tax income because we incurred tax losses for both state and federal tax purpose. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.5 million due primarily to the recognition of additional tax attributes that can offset alternative minimum tax as a result of the carryback of net operating losses.\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total federal and state unrecognized tax benefits of $14.3 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $13.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, if recognized, in the absence of a valuation allowance, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2016, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (746\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,088\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,701\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (103,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $25.2 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3%, compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenue recognized during 2016 from amortization of upfront fees amounted to $21.3 million, an increase of $3.6 million compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Celgene by $7.0 million related to the $70.0 million safety milestone achieved in December 2015, which was based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. This increase was offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in amortization of upfront fees from Bayer and GSK as a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payments to June 2017 and March 2017, respectively. The increase in amortization of upfront fees was further offset by a decrease in revenue of $7.5 million which was recognized in 2015 for a $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of anti-TIGIT under our collaboration with Celgene. Further, reimbursement of research and\ndevelopment costs for services performed for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $109.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $16.8 million, or 18%, compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was comprised of a $15.2 million increase in our external program costs and a $1.6 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $15.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $7.3 million in manufacturing costs and $2.9 million in toxicology study costs driven by clinical trials for our GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates as well as timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies. Clinical costs increased by $5.2 million due to additional patient enrollment during 2016 under our vantictumab (anti-Fzd, OMP-18R5) program and an increase in clinical activities under our anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) program. We expect that our external program costs will increase in future periods as we continue to advance our pipeline, enroll patients in various programs and initiate new clinical trials.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $1.6 million was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $0.6 million, regulatory and clinical consulting costs of $0.5 million related to GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates, and facilities-related expense of $0.5 million due to the execution of an amendment to our lease agreement in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $0.9 million mainly due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million in relation to the RSU refresher grants in 2016 and an increase in personnel costs of $0.3 million. This is offset by a decrease in legal fees of $0.6 million related to patent filings and financing costs associated with the Form S-3 filing in 2015.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,343\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,933\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,519\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (509\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,397\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $25.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 35%, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Company achieved a $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. The $70.0 million safety milestone was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the estimated period of performance, which is the period Celgene can exercise its option. The decrease is largely due to the recognition of $11.0 million in collaboration revenue from GSK in 2014 for the achievement of a development milestone related to first patient enrollment in the Phase II portion of the tarextumab ALPINE\u201d clinical trial compared to $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and $0.7 million for the reimbursement of research and development costs for services performed in 2015. In addition, we recognized a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of an undisclosed preclinical immuno-oncology program under our collaboration with Celgene in 2015 compared to a $2.5 million milestone for the designation of an anti-RSPO3 antibody as a clinical candidate under our collaboration with Celgene and $2.0 million milestone for the commencement of preclinical development stemming from our small molecule collaboration with Bayer in 2014. The amortization of upfront fees received in 2013 under the Celgene agreement remained constant at $13.1 million in 2015 and 2014. In addition, we recognized $3.5 million from the amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Bayer compared to $9.8 million in 2014 and we recognized $1.1 million in 2015 from the amortization of upfront fees under the GSK agreement compared to $1.2 million in 2014. These decreases are a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payment to March 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The estimated period of performance for the Bayer collaboration was revised as a result of the November 2015 amendment to the Company's agreement with Bayer, under which the Company and Bayer agreed to enroll up to 12 additional patients in each of the Phase Ib trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapy in breast cancer and ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies in ovarian cancer.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $16.4 million, or 22%, compared to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was comprised of a $10.1 million increase in our external program costs and a $6.3 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $10.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in clinical costs and $2.0 million in translational medicine costs driven by clinical trials for two Phase II programs,\ndemcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP21M18) and tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), and two new clinical programs, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) and navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), with higher patient costs. The increase is offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of $4.9 million and toxicology study costs of $0.8 million driven by timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $6.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in personnel costs related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. The remaining increase of $0.4 million was due to an increase in consulting and research supplies.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.8 million, or 35%, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $3.2 million related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the achievement of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015, non-employee Board of Director grants, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. We also incurred higher legal fees of $1.0 million related to patent filings and financing costs related to our Form S-3 filing in 2015, and the remaining increase of $0.6 million was due to an increase in recruiting fees, facilities charges and travel related costs.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and short term investments totaling $184.6 million. In June 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which permits: (a) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and/or units; and (b) as part of the $250.0 million, the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $50.0 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold under a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in one or more at-the-market offerings. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold 388,166 shares pursuant to our at-the-market program at a weighted average price of $12.59 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $4.7 million, net of offering costs.\nOn August 23, 2016, we closed the sale of an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on August 17, 2016, and related prospectus, pursuant to the shelf registration statement. We received net offering proceeds of approximately $59.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, primarily related to research and development product candidate expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nWe believe that our existing cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the third quarter of 2018, even without taking into account potential future milestone payments to us. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.\nOur future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the achievement of milestones and/or exercise of options under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the initiation, progress, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates and potential therapeutic candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of therapeutic candidates that we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress, costs and results of our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> funding we may receive under any new collaborations we may enter into or new government grants we may be awarded in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of procuring clinical supplies of our therapeutic candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,936\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (75,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84,497\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,703\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $36.9 million. The net loss of $103.1 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.8 million for depreciation and amortization and $11.1 million for stock-based compensation expense. The change in net operating assets of $53.3 million was due primarily to a decrease of $68.2 million in accounts receivable as a result of collection in 2016 of payments related to the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone during 2015 from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The decrease in deferred revenue is due to the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements of $21.3 million. The remaining net change in operating assets which increased cash was a result of an increase in accrued clinical liabilities of $9.6 million offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $1.8 million and accrued liabilities of $3.1 million due to timing of payments.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $75.1 million. The net loss of $85.4 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.6 million for depreciation and amortization and $10.8 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $2.1 million was due primarily to an increase of $70.7 million in accounts receivable and increase of $52.3 million in deferred revenue as result of the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The increase in deferred revenue is offset by the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $17.7 million. There was also a $7.1 million decrease in tax receivable as result of the receipt of payment and $5.4 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $3.7 million in accrued liabilities, $2.2 million in accounts payable, $1.4 million increase in prepaid and other assets, and $0.7 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $84.5 million. The net loss of $50.0 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.4 million for depreciation and amortization and $6.2 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $42.1 million was due primarily to a decrease of $35.1 million in deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue for the achievement of a $11.0 million\ndevelopment milestone for dosing the first patient in the Phase II portion of the anti-Notch2/3 ALPINE\u201d clinical trial in the second indication of our tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5) program and the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $24.1 million. There was also a $7.1 million increase in tax receivable, $3.9 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $1.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $10.8 million decrease in income tax payable, $10.3 million decrease in deferred tax asset, $1.2 million decrease in prepaid and other assets, and $0.6 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of purchases of short-term investments amounting to $207.3 million, $128.8 million and $436.9 million, respectively, offset by maturities of short-term investments amounting to $178.7 million, $213.8 million and $340.3 million, respectively. Acquisition of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, amounted to $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of aggregate net proceeds of $63.9 million received from the sale of shares of our common stock through our underwritten public offering that closed on August 23, 2016 and from our at-the-market offering program and aggregate proceeds of $1.2 million received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Operating leases include total future non-cancelable obligations under operating lease agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company leases office and laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California under a lease agreement that expires in January 2019 and includes a lease extension option for two additional three-year terms. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company signed an amendment to the lease agreement to extend the lease term through May 2028, with an option to extend the lease for an additional three-year term.\nThe amendment to the lease agreement includes a 10-year cancelable lease agreement for additional office and laboratory space that expires in May 2028, subject to the Company's three-year lease extension option described above. The base rent obligation on this additional space is estimated to commence in June 2018 and the total estimated base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $13.8 million. In addition to the base rent payments, the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for the Company's share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The Company has the right to terminate the lease agreement for this additional space prior to September 16, 2017 and the exercise of such cancelation would not result in an economic penalty to the Company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. See Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Under collaboration agreements, we may receive non-refundable upfront payments, funding for research and development services, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties. In assessing the appropriate revenue recognition related to a collaboration agreement, we first determine whether an arrangement includes multiple elements, such as the delivery of intellectual property rights and research and development services. These multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. The determination of stand-alone value is generally based on whether any deliverable has stand-alone value to the customer. We determine how to allocate arrangement consideration to identified units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy provided under the relevant guidance. The estimated fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence are not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current liabilities.\nWe recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed. We record these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis and not as a reduction of research and development expenses, as we have the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities.\nTypically, we have not granted licenses to collaborators at the beginning of our arrangements and thus there are no delivered items separate from the research and development services provided. As such, upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as collaboration revenue over the estimated period of performance that is consistent with the terms of the research and development obligations contained in the collaboration agreement. We regularly review the estimated period of performance based on the progress made under each arrangement. Our estimates of our performance period may change over the course of the research term. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nWhen we enter into an amendment to a collaboration agreement, we evaluate the terms of the amendment relative to the entire arrangement to determine if it constitutes a material modification to the original agreement for financial reporting purposes. We exercise judgment in determining if an amendment is deemed to be a material modification and consider whether there is a change in total consideration, contracted deliverables, the period of the arrangement or the delivery schedule.\nOther contingent payments received for which payment is contingent solely on the results of a collaborative partner's performance are not accounted for using the milestone method. Such bonus payments will be recognized as revenue when collectability is reasonably assured.\nOptions are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option and the likelihood that the option will be exercised. For arrangements under which an option is considered substantive, we do not consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated opt-in payments are not included in allocable arrangement consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, for arrangements under which an option is not considered substantive or if an option is priced at a significant and incremental discount, we would consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. All of the options included in our collaboration arrangements have been determined to be substantive, and none of the options are priced at a significant and incremental discount.\nWe recognize revenue under government contracts and grants when the work is performed or the expenses are incurred. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.\nPreclinical Studies and Clinical Trial Accruals\nWe estimate our preclinical studies and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct these activities on our behalf. In recording service fees, we estimate the time period over which the related services will be performed and compare the level of effort expended through the end of each period to the cumulative expenses recorded and payments made for such services and, as appropriate, accrue additional service fees or defer any non-refundable advance payments until the related services are performed. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust our accrual or deferred advance payment accordingly. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense was $11.1 million, $10.8 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. These assumptions include:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We used the simplified method to determine the expected terms as provided by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Volatility-The expected volatility is derived from a blend of the historical volatilities of the Company's own common stock and of the common stock of comparable publicly listed biopharmaceutical companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option grants because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock due to no significant trading history. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, and financial leverage in comparison to us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected dividend-The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nPrior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors, with the assistance of management and independent consultants, performed fair value analyses for the valuation of our common stock. For grants made on dates for which there was no contemporaneous valuation to utilize in setting the exercise price of our common stock, and given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors, including:\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> progress of our research and development efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our operating results and financial condition, including our levels of available capital resources;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> material risks related to our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an initial public offering given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> that the grants involved illiquid securities in a private company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the options granted subsequent to our July 2013 IPO, the exercise price of stock options is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial\nperformance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nNewly Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606, to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients to provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively. The effective date for these new standards is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. We expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\nThe adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have a material effect on our financial statements. To date, we have derived our revenues from collaboration agreements. The consideration we are eligible to receive under these agreements includes upfront payments, research and development funding, and milestone payments. Each collaboration agreement is unique and will need to be assessed separately under the five-step process under the new standard. We have started our preliminary assessment of our active license and collaboration agreements. We expect that our evaluation of the accounting for collaboration agreements under the new revenue standard could identify material changes from the current accounting treatment. ASU 2014-09 differs from the current accounting standard in many respects, such as in the accounting for variable consideration, including milestone payments. Under our current accounting policy, we recognize milestone revenue using the milestone method specified in ASC 605-28, which generally results in the recognition of the milestone payment as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved. However, under the new accounting standard, it is possible to start to recognize milestone revenue before the milestone is achieved, subject to management's assessment of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, the current accounting standards include a presumption that revenue from up-front non-refundable fees would be recognized ratably over the performance period, unless another attribution method was determined to more closely approximate the delivery of the goods or services to the customer. The new accounting standard does not have a presumption that entities would default to a ratable attribution approach and will require entities to determine an appropriate attribution method using either output or input methods. As such, the amount and timing of revenue recognition for our collaboration agreements may change under the new revenue standard.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-15 (Subtopic 205-40) Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether or not there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods therein with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of the standard did not have material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases.\u201d ASU 2016-02 amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements, we anticipate recognition of additional assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases on our Balance Sheets.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2017. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage

We believe that a key reason for the limitations of many current cancer treatments is that they fail to impede the growth of cancer stem cells, or CSCs, which are responsible for the initiation, metastasis and recurrence of many cancers. Our research into CSC pathways such as Notch, Wnt and RSPO-LGR, has also led us to identify immuno-oncology biologics intended to bolster immune system recognition of cancer cells and/or suppress immune system evasion mechanisms. We believe our therapeutic candidates are quite distinct from current generations of chemotherapies and targeted therapies, and have the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer. All of our therapeutic candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories.\nWe currently have eight therapeutic candidates currently in clinical development targeting CSC pathways and immuno-oncology, including our most recent Investigational New Drug, or IND, filing for our anti-TIGIT program. We are also pursuing discovery of additional novel approaches to cancer treatment including new immuno-oncology therapeutic candidates. Our first therapeutic candidate in the clinic, demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18), is currently being studied in three trials: a randomized Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer, a randomized Phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and a Phase Ib trial combining demcizumab and prembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae). Demcizumab has received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from the FDA. The second candidate, tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), is currently in a randomized Phase II clinical trial known as PINNACLE\u201d in combination with platinum chemotherapy and etoposide in small cell lung cancer patients. In January 2016, we discontinued a second Phase II trial of tarextumab in combination with Abraxane\u00ae and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients. In January 2015, tarextumab received orphan drug designation from the FDA for both pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. With respect to the third candidate, vantictumab (anti-Fzd,\nOMP-18R5), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib clinical trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapies in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Regarding the fourth candidate, ipafricept (Fzd8-Fc, OMP-54F28), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib trials of ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies, one in pancreatic cancer and the second in ovarian cancer. The fifth therapeutic candidate, navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), is currently in a single-agent Phase Ia trial that is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, and we have initiated two Phase Ib clinical trials of navicixizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. Regarding the sixth candidate, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10), we are currently enrolling patients in both portions of a Phase Ia/b clinical trial. The Phase Ia portion is in solid tumor patients and the Phase Ib portion is in patients with certain colorectal or gastric cancers and combines anti-RSPO3 with standard-of-care chemotherapy. The seventh candidate, brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51), is currently being studied in a Phase Ib clinical trial in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf\u00ae) in colorectal cancer patients. Our IND submission with the FDA for our eighth therapeutic candidate, anti-TIGIT (OMP-313M32) has been cleared and we expect to begin enrolling patients in a Phase Ia clinical trial for anti-TIGIT during the first half of 2017. Clinical trials for all eight of these therapeutic candidates are ongoing, with the intent of gathering additional data required to proceed to later stage clinical trials and product approval. We plan to file an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our ninth therapeutic candidate, GITRL-Fc (OMP-336B11), in the first half of 2017.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from upfront payments and development milestones received from GSK, Bayer and Celgene. We recognize revenue from upfront payments ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreements. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives or the exercise of options for specified programs by our strategic partners. Such payments are recorded as revenue when we achieve the underlying milestone if there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved. We also recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which is related to the recognition of upfront payments, milestone payments and reimbursements of research and development costs under our various collaboration arrangements:\n\nWe expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments from our collaborations with GSK, Bayer and Celgene or any new collaboration we may enter in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research such as the discovery and development of clinical candidates for GSK, Bayer and Celgene as well as discovery and development of our proprietary unpartnered therapeutic candidates. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of employee salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, third-party contract costs relating to research, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trial activities, laboratory consumables, and allocated facility costs.\nAt any point in time, we typically have various early stage research and drug discovery projects. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery project and are typically deployed across multiple projects. As such, we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these early stage research and drug discovery programs on a project-specific basis.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The internal costs include personnel, facility costs, laboratory consumables and discovery and research related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party contract costs relating to manufacturing, clinical trial activities, translational medicine and toxicology activities.\n\nOur research and development expenses have increased as we have progressed our therapeutic candidates, and we expect that these expenses may continue to increase with continued pipeline advancement and conduct of our development activities under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success of each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nFor the biologic programs covered under our strategic alliances with GSK, Bayer and Celgene, we are responsible for development of each therapeutic candidate prior to the exercise of GSK's, Bayer's or Celgene's option to exclusively license such therapeutic candidate. GSK may exercise such an option on a product-by-product basis, Bayer may exercise such an option on a class-by-class basis, and Celgene may exercise such option on a program-by-program basis, in each case, during certain time periods, which for GSK, Bayer and Celgene are\nthrough the end of certain Phase I or Phase II trials, depending on the applicable therapeutic candidate or program. If GSK exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all further development obligations for such therapeutic candidate are assumed by GSK. If Bayer exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all development obligations for such therapeutic candidate after such therapeutic candidate reaches a defined early development stage are assumed by Bayer. With respect to biologic therapeutic programs, if Celgene exercises its option for a given program, we will have the option to co-develop and co-commercialize up to five of the six such therapeutic candidates in the United States. If we do so, we will be responsible for a one-third share of the global development costs of such therapeutic candidates, with Celgene bearing the remaining two-thirds of such costs, and we will be entitled to participate in the commercialization activities for such therapeutic candidates in the United States, and to share 50% of all profits and losses arising from U.S. sales of such therapeutic candidates. Otherwise, we may enter into a license agreement with Celgene for such therapeutic candidate whereupon Celgene would be responsible for all further development costs. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option under the Celgene Agreement to further develop and commercialize small molecule therapeutics directed to targets in an undisclosed pathway, all further development obligations with respect to the small molecule therapeutic program will be assumed by Celgene.\nMost of our product development programs are at an early stage; therefore, the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. Given the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates or if and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates. We anticipate that we and our strategic alliance partners will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, as well as an ongoing assessment as to each therapeutic candidate's commercial potential. We may need to raise additional capital or may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to complete the development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment and other expenses for outside professional services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, human resource, audit, tax and accounting services and other consulting costs.\nSince becoming a public company in 2013, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses required of public companies, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Other related public company costs include increased expenses for additional insurance, investor relations and other needs for human resources and professional services.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest income consists primarily of interest received on our cash and short-term investments balances.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a tax expense of $14,000 and $20,000, respectively, due to interest on uncertain tax positions. We did not record an income tax provision on pre-tax income because we incurred tax losses for both state and federal tax purpose. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.5 million due primarily to the recognition of additional tax attributes that can offset alternative minimum tax as a result of the carryback of net operating losses.\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total federal and state unrecognized tax benefits of $14.3 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $13.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, if recognized, in the absence of a valuation allowance, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2016, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $25.2 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3%, compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenue recognized during 2016 from amortization of upfront fees amounted to $21.3 million, an increase of $3.6 million compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Celgene by $7.0 million related to the $70.0 million safety milestone achieved in December 2015, which was based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. This increase was offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in amortization of upfront fees from Bayer and GSK as a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payments to June 2017 and March 2017, respectively. The increase in amortization of upfront fees was further offset by a decrease in revenue of $7.5 million which was recognized in 2015 for a $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of anti-TIGIT under our collaboration with Celgene. Further, reimbursement of research and\ndevelopment costs for services performed for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $109.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $16.8 million, or 18%, compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was comprised of a $15.2 million increase in our external program costs and a $1.6 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $15.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $7.3 million in manufacturing costs and $2.9 million in toxicology study costs driven by clinical trials for our GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates as well as timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies. Clinical costs increased by $5.2 million due to additional patient enrollment during 2016 under our vantictumab (anti-Fzd, OMP-18R5) program and an increase in clinical activities under our anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) program. We expect that our external program costs will increase in future periods as we continue to advance our pipeline, enroll patients in various programs and initiate new clinical trials.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $1.6 million was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $0.6 million, regulatory and clinical consulting costs of $0.5 million related to GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates, and facilities-related expense of $0.5 million due to the execution of an amendment to our lease agreement in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $0.9 million mainly due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million in relation to the RSU refresher grants in 2016 and an increase in personnel costs of $0.3 million. This is offset by a decrease in legal fees of $0.6 million related to patent filings and financing costs associated with the Form S-3 filing in 2015.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $25.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 35%, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Company achieved a $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. The $70.0 million safety milestone was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the estimated period of performance, which is the period Celgene can exercise its option. The decrease is largely due to the recognition of $11.0 million in collaboration revenue from GSK in 2014 for the achievement of a development milestone related to first patient enrollment in the Phase II portion of the tarextumab ALPINE\u201d clinical trial compared to $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and $0.7 million for the reimbursement of research and development costs for services performed in 2015. In addition, we recognized a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of an undisclosed preclinical immuno-oncology program under our collaboration with Celgene in 2015 compared to a $2.5 million milestone for the designation of an anti-RSPO3 antibody as a clinical candidate under our collaboration with Celgene and $2.0 million milestone for the commencement of preclinical development stemming from our small molecule collaboration with Bayer in 2014. The amortization of upfront fees received in 2013 under the Celgene agreement remained constant at $13.1 million in 2015 and 2014. In addition, we recognized $3.5 million from the amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Bayer compared to $9.8 million in 2014 and we recognized $1.1 million in 2015 from the amortization of upfront fees under the GSK agreement compared to $1.2 million in 2014. These decreases are a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payment to March 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The estimated period of performance for the Bayer collaboration was revised as a result of the November 2015 amendment to the Company's agreement with Bayer, under which the Company and Bayer agreed to enroll up to 12 additional patients in each of the Phase Ib trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapy in breast cancer and ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies in ovarian cancer.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $16.4 million, or 22%, compared to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was comprised of a $10.1 million increase in our external program costs and a $6.3 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $10.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in clinical costs and $2.0 million in translational medicine costs driven by clinical trials for two Phase II programs,\ndemcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP21M18) and tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), and two new clinical programs, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) and navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), with higher patient costs. The increase is offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of $4.9 million and toxicology study costs of $0.8 million driven by timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $6.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in personnel costs related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. The remaining increase of $0.4 million was due to an increase in consulting and research supplies.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.8 million, or 35%, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $3.2 million related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the achievement of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015, non-employee Board of Director grants, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. We also incurred higher legal fees of $1.0 million related to patent filings and financing costs related to our Form S-3 filing in 2015, and the remaining increase of $0.6 million was due to an increase in recruiting fees, facilities charges and travel related costs.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and short term investments totaling $184.6 million. In June 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which permits: (a) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and/or units; and (b) as part of the $250.0 million, the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $50.0 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold under a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in one or more at-the-market offerings. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold 388,166 shares pursuant to our at-the-market program at a weighted average price of $12.59 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $4.7 million, net of offering costs.\nOn August 23, 2016, we closed the sale of an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on August 17, 2016, and related prospectus, pursuant to the shelf registration statement. We received net offering proceeds of approximately $59.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, primarily related to research and development product candidate expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nWe believe that our existing cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the third quarter of 2018, even without taking into account potential future milestone payments to us. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.\nOur future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the achievement of milestones and/or exercise of options under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene; \n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates and potential therapeutic candidates; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of therapeutic candidates that we pursue; \n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements; \n \u2022 funding we may receive under any new collaborations we may enter into or new government grants we may be awarded in the future; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of procuring clinical supplies of our therapeutic candidates. \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $36.9 million. The net loss of $103.1 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.8 million for depreciation and amortization and $11.1 million for stock-based compensation expense. The change in net operating assets of $53.3 million was due primarily to a decrease of $68.2 million in accounts receivable as a result of collection in 2016 of payments related to the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone during 2015 from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The decrease in deferred revenue is due to the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements of $21.3 million. The remaining net change in operating assets which increased cash was a result of an increase in accrued clinical liabilities of $9.6 million offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $1.8 million and accrued liabilities of $3.1 million due to timing of payments.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $75.1 million. The net loss of $85.4 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.6 million for depreciation and amortization and $10.8 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $2.1 million was due primarily to an increase of $70.7 million in accounts receivable and increase of $52.3 million in deferred revenue as result of the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The increase in deferred revenue is offset by the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $17.7 million. There was also a $7.1 million decrease in tax receivable as result of the receipt of payment and $5.4 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $3.7 million in accrued liabilities, $2.2 million in accounts payable, $1.4 million increase in prepaid and other assets, and $0.7 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $84.5 million. The net loss of $50.0 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.4 million for depreciation and amortization and $6.2 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $42.1 million was due primarily to a decrease of $35.1 million in deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue for the achievement of a $11.0 million\ndevelopment milestone for dosing the first patient in the Phase II portion of the anti-Notch2/3 ALPINE\u201d clinical trial in the second indication of our tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5) program and the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $24.1 million. There was also a $7.1 million increase in tax receivable, $3.9 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $1.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $10.8 million decrease in income tax payable, $10.3 million decrease in deferred tax asset, $1.2 million decrease in prepaid and other assets, and $0.6 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of purchases of short-term investments amounting to $207.3 million, $128.8 million and $436.9 million, respectively, offset by maturities of short-term investments amounting to $178.7 million, $213.8 million and $340.3 million, respectively. Acquisition of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, amounted to $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of aggregate net proceeds of $63.9 million received from the sale of shares of our common stock through our underwritten public offering that closed on August 23, 2016 and from our at-the-market offering program and aggregate proceeds of $1.2 million received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Operating leases include total future non-cancelable obligations under operating lease agreement. \nThe Company leases office and laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California under a lease agreement that expires in January 2019 and includes a lease extension option for two additional three-year terms. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company signed an amendment to the lease agreement to extend the lease term through May 2028, with an option to extend the lease for an additional three-year term.\nThe amendment to the lease agreement includes a 10-year cancelable lease agreement for additional office and laboratory space that expires in May 2028, subject to the Company's three-year lease extension option described above. The base rent obligation on this additional space is estimated to commence in June 2018 and the total estimated base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $13.8 million. In addition to the base rent payments, the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for the Company's share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The Company has the right to terminate the lease agreement for this additional space prior to September 16, 2017 and the exercise of such cancelation would not result in an economic penalty to the Company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. See Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Under collaboration agreements, we may receive non-refundable upfront payments, funding for research and development services, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties. In assessing the appropriate revenue recognition related to a collaboration agreement, we first determine whether an arrangement includes multiple elements, such as the delivery of intellectual property rights and research and development services. These multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. The determination of stand-alone value is generally based on whether any deliverable has stand-alone value to the customer. We determine how to allocate arrangement consideration to identified units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy provided under the relevant guidance. The estimated fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence are not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current liabilities.\nWe recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed. We record these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis and not as a reduction of research and development expenses, as we have the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities.\nTypically, we have not granted licenses to collaborators at the beginning of our arrangements and thus there are no delivered items separate from the research and development services provided. As such, upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as collaboration revenue over the estimated period of performance that is consistent with the terms of the research and development obligations contained in the collaboration agreement. We regularly review the estimated period of performance based on the progress made under each arrangement. Our estimates of our performance period may change over the course of the research term. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nWhen we enter into an amendment to a collaboration agreement, we evaluate the terms of the amendment relative to the entire arrangement to determine if it constitutes a material modification to the original agreement for financial reporting purposes. We exercise judgment in determining if an amendment is deemed to be a material modification and consider whether there is a change in total consideration, contracted deliverables, the period of the arrangement or the delivery schedule.\nOther contingent payments received for which payment is contingent solely on the results of a collaborative partner's performance are not accounted for using the milestone method. Such bonus payments will be recognized as revenue when collectability is reasonably assured.\nOptions are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option and the likelihood that the option will be exercised. For arrangements under which an option is considered substantive, we do not consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated opt-in payments are not included in allocable arrangement consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, for arrangements under which an option is not considered substantive or if an option is priced at a significant and incremental discount, we would consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. All of the options included in our collaboration arrangements have been determined to be substantive, and none of the options are priced at a significant and incremental discount.\nWe recognize revenue under government contracts and grants when the work is performed or the expenses are incurred. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.\nPreclinical Studies and Clinical Trial Accruals\nWe estimate our preclinical studies and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct these activities on our behalf. In recording service fees, we estimate the time period over which the related services will be performed and compare the level of effort expended through the end of each period to the cumulative expenses recorded and payments made for such services and, as appropriate, accrue additional service fees or defer any non-refundable advance payments until the related services are performed. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust our accrual or deferred advance payment accordingly. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense was $11.1 million, $10.8 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. These assumptions include:\n \u2022 Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We used the simplified method to determine the expected terms as provided by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. \n \u2022 Volatility-The expected volatility is derived from a blend of the historical volatilities of the Company's own common stock and of the common stock of comparable publicly listed biopharmaceutical companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option grants because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock due to no significant trading history. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, and financial leverage in comparison to us. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards. \n \u2022 Expected dividend-The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. \nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nPrior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors, with the assistance of management and independent consultants, performed fair value analyses for the valuation of our common stock. For grants made on dates for which there was no contemporaneous valuation to utilize in setting the exercise price of our common stock, and given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors, including:\n \u2022 progress of our research and development efforts; \n \u2022 our operating results and financial condition, including our levels of available capital resources; \n \u2022 rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities; \n \u2022 material risks related to our business; \n \u2022 equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an initial public offering given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; and \n \u2022 that the grants involved illiquid securities in a private company. \nFor the options granted subsequent to our July 2013 IPO, the exercise price of stock options is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial\nperformance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nNewly Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606, to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients to provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively. The effective date for these new standards is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. We expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\nThe adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have a material effect on our financial statements. To date, we have derived our revenues from collaboration agreements. The consideration we are eligible to receive under these agreements includes upfront payments, research and development funding, and milestone payments. Each collaboration agreement is unique and will need to be assessed separately under the five-step process under the new standard. We have started our preliminary assessment of our active license and collaboration agreements. We expect that our evaluation of the accounting for collaboration agreements under the new revenue standard could identify material changes from the current accounting treatment. ASU 2014-09 differs from the current accounting standard in many respects, such as in the accounting for variable consideration, including milestone payments. Under our current accounting policy, we recognize milestone revenue using the milestone method specified in ASC 605-28, which generally results in the recognition of the milestone payment as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved. However, under the new accounting standard, it is possible to start to recognize milestone revenue before the milestone is achieved, subject to management's assessment of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, the current accounting standards include a presumption that revenue from up-front non-refundable fees would be recognized ratably over the performance period, unless another attribution method was determined to more closely approximate the delivery of the goods or services to the customer. The new accounting standard does not have a presumption that entities would default to a ratable attribution approach and will require entities to determine an appropriate attribution method using either output or input methods. As such, the amount and timing of revenue recognition for our collaboration agreements may change under the new revenue standard.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-15 (Subtopic 205-40) Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether or not there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods therein with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of the standard did not have material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases.\u201d ASU 2016-02 amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements, we anticipate recognition of additional assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases on our Balance Sheets.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including the income tax consequences, classification", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We believe that a key reason for the limitations of many current cancer treatments is that they fail to impede the growth of cancer stem cells, or CSCs, which are responsible for the initiation, metastasis and recurrence of many cancers. Our research into CSC pathways such as Notch, Wnt and RSPO-LGR, has also led us to identify immuno-oncology biologics intended to bolster immune system recognition of cancer cells and/or suppress immune system evasion mechanisms. We believe our therapeutic candidates are quite distinct from current generations of chemotherapies and targeted therapies, and have the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer. All of our therapeutic candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories.\nWe currently have eight therapeutic candidates currently in clinical development targeting CSC pathways and immuno-oncology, including our most recent Investigational New Drug, or IND, filing for our anti-TIGIT program. We are also pursuing discovery of additional novel approaches to cancer treatment including new immuno-oncology therapeutic candidates. Our first therapeutic candidate in the clinic, demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18), is currently being studied in three trials: a randomized Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer, a randomized Phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and a Phase Ib trial combining demcizumab and prembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae). Demcizumab has received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from the FDA. The second candidate, tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), is currently in a randomized Phase II clinical trial known as PINNACLE\u201d in combination with platinum chemotherapy and etoposide in small cell lung cancer patients. In January 2016, we discontinued a second Phase II trial of tarextumab in combination with Abraxane\u00ae and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients. In January 2015, tarextumab received orphan drug designation from the FDA for both pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. With respect to the third candidate, vantictumab (anti-Fzd,\nOMP-18R5), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib clinical trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapies in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Regarding the fourth candidate, ipafricept (Fzd8-Fc, OMP-54F28), we are currently enrolling patients in two Phase Ib trials of ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies, one in pancreatic cancer and the second in ovarian cancer. The fifth therapeutic candidate, navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), is currently in a single-agent Phase Ia trial that is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, and we have initiated two Phase Ib clinical trials of navicixizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. Regarding the sixth candidate, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10), we are currently enrolling patients in both portions of a Phase Ia/b clinical trial. The Phase Ia portion is in solid tumor patients and the Phase Ib portion is in patients with certain colorectal or gastric cancers and combines anti-RSPO3 with standard-of-care chemotherapy. The seventh candidate, brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51), is currently being studied in a Phase Ib clinical trial in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf\u00ae) in colorectal cancer patients. Our IND submission with the FDA for our eighth therapeutic candidate, anti-TIGIT (OMP-313M32) has been cleared and we expect to begin enrolling patients in a Phase Ia clinical trial for anti-TIGIT during the first half of 2017. Clinical trials for all eight of these therapeutic candidates are ongoing, with the intent of gathering additional data required to proceed to later stage clinical trials and product approval. We plan to file an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our ninth therapeutic candidate, GITRL-Fc (OMP-336B11), in the first half of 2017.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from upfront payments and development milestones received from GSK, Bayer and Celgene. We recognize revenue from upfront payments ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreements. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives or the exercise of options for specified programs by our strategic partners. Such payments are recorded as revenue when we achieve the underlying milestone if there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved. We also recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, which is related to the recognition of upfront payments, milestone payments and reimbursements of research and development costs under our various collaboration arrangements:\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GSK:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GSK total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bayer:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bayer total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Celgene:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recognition of upfront payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Milestone revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Celgene total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments from our collaborations with GSK, Bayer and Celgene or any new collaboration we may enter in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research such as the discovery and development of clinical candidates for GSK, Bayer and Celgene as well as discovery and development of our proprietary unpartnered therapeutic candidates. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of employee salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, third-party contract costs relating to research, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trial activities, laboratory consumables, and allocated facility costs.\nAt any point in time, we typically have various early stage research and drug discovery projects. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery project and are typically deployed across multiple projects. As such, we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these early stage research and drug discovery programs on a project-specific basis.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The internal costs include personnel, facility costs, laboratory consumables and discovery and research related activities associated with our pipeline. The external program costs reflect external costs attributable to our clinical development candidates and preclinical candidates selected for further development. Such expenses include third-party contract costs relating to manufacturing, clinical trial activities, translational medicine and toxicology activities.\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internal Costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cancer biology, pathology and toxicology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Molecular and cellular biology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Process development and manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal internal costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> External Program Costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Translational medicine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toxicology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subtotal external program costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur research and development expenses have increased as we have progressed our therapeutic candidates, and we expect that these expenses may continue to increase with continued pipeline advancement and conduct of our development activities under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or our partners may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success of each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nFor the biologic programs covered under our strategic alliances with GSK, Bayer and Celgene, we are responsible for development of each therapeutic candidate prior to the exercise of GSK's, Bayer's or Celgene's option to exclusively license such therapeutic candidate. GSK may exercise such an option on a product-by-product basis, Bayer may exercise such an option on a class-by-class basis, and Celgene may exercise such option on a program-by-program basis, in each case, during certain time periods, which for GSK, Bayer and Celgene are\nthrough the end of certain Phase I or Phase II trials, depending on the applicable therapeutic candidate or program. If GSK exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all further development obligations for such therapeutic candidate are assumed by GSK. If Bayer exercises its option for a therapeutic candidate, all development obligations for such therapeutic candidate after such therapeutic candidate reaches a defined early development stage are assumed by Bayer. With respect to biologic therapeutic programs, if Celgene exercises its option for a given program, we will have the option to co-develop and co-commercialize up to five of the six such therapeutic candidates in the United States. If we do so, we will be responsible for a one-third share of the global development costs of such therapeutic candidates, with Celgene bearing the remaining two-thirds of such costs, and we will be entitled to participate in the commercialization activities for such therapeutic candidates in the United States, and to share 50% of all profits and losses arising from U.S. sales of such therapeutic candidates. Otherwise, we may enter into a license agreement with Celgene for such therapeutic candidate whereupon Celgene would be responsible for all further development costs. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option under the Celgene Agreement to further develop and commercialize small molecule therapeutics directed to targets in an undisclosed pathway, all further development obligations with respect to the small molecule therapeutic program will be assumed by Celgene.\nMost of our product development programs are at an early stage; therefore, the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. Given the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates or if and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates. We anticipate that we and our strategic alliance partners will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, as well as an ongoing assessment as to each therapeutic candidate's commercial potential. We may need to raise additional capital or may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to complete the development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment and other expenses for outside professional services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, human resource, audit, tax and accounting services and other consulting costs.\nSince becoming a public company in 2013, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses required of public companies, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Other related public company costs include increased expenses for additional insurance, investor relations and other needs for human resources and professional services.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest income consists primarily of interest received on our cash and short-term investments balances.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a tax expense of $14,000 and $20,000, respectively, due to interest on uncertain tax positions. We did not record an income tax provision on pre-tax income because we incurred tax losses for both state and federal tax purpose. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.5 million due primarily to the recognition of additional tax attributes that can offset alternative minimum tax as a result of the carryback of net operating losses.\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total federal and state unrecognized tax benefits of $14.3 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $13.1 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, if recognized, in the absence of a valuation allowance, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2016, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (746\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,088\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,701\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (103,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $25.2 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 3%, compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenue recognized during 2016 from amortization of upfront fees amounted to $21.3 million, an increase of $3.6 million compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Celgene by $7.0 million related to the $70.0 million safety milestone achieved in December 2015, which was based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. This increase was offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in amortization of upfront fees from Bayer and GSK as a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payments to June 2017 and March 2017, respectively. The increase in amortization of upfront fees was further offset by a decrease in revenue of $7.5 million which was recognized in 2015 for a $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of anti-TIGIT under our collaboration with Celgene. Further, reimbursement of research and\ndevelopment costs for services performed for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3.2 million compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $109.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $16.8 million, or 18%, compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was comprised of a $15.2 million increase in our external program costs and a $1.6 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $15.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $7.3 million in manufacturing costs and $2.9 million in toxicology study costs driven by clinical trials for our GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates as well as timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies. Clinical costs increased by $5.2 million due to additional patient enrollment during 2016 under our vantictumab (anti-Fzd, OMP-18R5) program and an increase in clinical activities under our anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) program. We expect that our external program costs will increase in future periods as we continue to advance our pipeline, enroll patients in various programs and initiate new clinical trials.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $1.6 million was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $0.6 million, regulatory and clinical consulting costs of $0.5 million related to GITRL-Fc and anti-TIGIT therapeutic candidates, and facilities-related expense of $0.5 million due to the execution of an amendment to our lease agreement in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $0.9 million mainly due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million in relation to the RSU refresher grants in 2016 and an increase in personnel costs of $0.3 million. This is offset by a decrease in legal fees of $0.6 million related to patent filings and financing costs associated with the Form S-3 filing in 2015.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,343\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,624\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,933\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,387\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,519\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (509\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (85,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,397\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $25.9 million, a decrease of $13.7 million, or 35%, compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Company achieved a $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of available demcizumab Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety. The $70.0 million safety milestone was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the estimated period of performance, which is the period Celgene can exercise its option. The decrease is largely due to the recognition of $11.0 million in collaboration revenue from GSK in 2014 for the achievement of a development milestone related to first patient enrollment in the Phase II portion of the tarextumab ALPINE\u201d clinical trial compared to $5.0 million development milestone from GSK for dosing the first patient in the Phase I expansion portion of the brontictuzumab (anti-Notch1, OMP-52M51) clinical trial and $0.7 million for the reimbursement of research and development costs for services performed in 2015. In addition, we recognized a $2.5 million milestone for clinical candidate designation of an undisclosed preclinical immuno-oncology program under our collaboration with Celgene in 2015 compared to a $2.5 million milestone for the designation of an anti-RSPO3 antibody as a clinical candidate under our collaboration with Celgene and $2.0 million milestone for the commencement of preclinical development stemming from our small molecule collaboration with Bayer in 2014. The amortization of upfront fees received in 2013 under the Celgene agreement remained constant at $13.1 million in 2015 and 2014. In addition, we recognized $3.5 million from the amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Bayer compared to $9.8 million in 2014 and we recognized $1.1 million in 2015 from the amortization of upfront fees under the GSK agreement compared to $1.2 million in 2014. These decreases are a result of revisions to the estimated periods of performance for the Bayer and GSK collaborations which extended the amortization of the upfront payment to March 2017 and December 2016, respectively. The estimated period of performance for the Bayer collaboration was revised as a result of the November 2015 amendment to the Company's agreement with Bayer, under which the Company and Bayer agreed to enroll up to 12 additional patients in each of the Phase Ib trials of vantictumab in combination with standard-of-care therapy in breast cancer and ipafricept in combination with standard-of-care therapies in ovarian cancer.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $16.4 million, or 22%, compared to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was comprised of a $10.1 million increase in our external program costs and a $6.3 million increase in our internal program costs.\nThe increase in our external program costs of $10.1 million was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in clinical costs and $2.0 million in translational medicine costs driven by clinical trials for two Phase II programs,\ndemcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP21M18) and tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5), and two new clinical programs, anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) and navicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific, OMP-305B83), with higher patient costs. The increase is offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of $4.9 million and toxicology study costs of $0.8 million driven by timing of production of materials used in the various clinical studies.\nThe increase in our internal costs of $6.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in personnel costs related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015 and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. The remaining increase of $0.4 million was due to an increase in consulting and research supplies.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.8 million, or 35%, compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs of $3.2 million related to stock-based compensation, including the acceleration of expense related to restricted stock units as a result of the achievement of the Celgene safety milestone in the fourth quarter of 2015, non-employee Board of Director grants, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and option grant expenses in 2015, resulting from an increase in headcount. We also incurred higher legal fees of $1.0 million related to patent filings and financing costs related to our Form S-3 filing in 2015, and the remaining increase of $0.6 million was due to an increase in recruiting fees, facilities charges and travel related costs.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), net\nInterest and other income (expense), net was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a change of $0.1 million, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily due to interest earned on cash and investments during the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and short term investments totaling $184.6 million. In June 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which permits: (a) the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and/or units; and (b) as part of the $250.0 million, the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $50.0 million of our common stock that may be issued and sold under a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in one or more at-the-market offerings. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold 388,166 shares pursuant to our at-the-market program at a weighted average price of $12.59 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $4.7 million, net of offering costs.\nOn August 23, 2016, we closed the sale of an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share. The shares were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on August 17, 2016, and related prospectus, pursuant to the shelf registration statement. We received net offering proceeds of approximately $59.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, primarily related to research and development product candidate expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nWe believe that our existing cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the third quarter of 2018, even without taking into account potential future milestone payments to us. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.\nOur future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the achievement of milestones and/or exercise of options under our agreements with GSK, Bayer and Celgene; \n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates and potential therapeutic candidates; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of therapeutic candidates that we pursue; \n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements; \n \u2022 funding we may receive under any new collaborations we may enter into or new government grants we may be awarded in the future; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of procuring clinical supplies of our therapeutic candidates. \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,936\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (75,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84,497\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,703\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $36.9 million. The net loss of $103.1 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.8 million for depreciation and amortization and $11.1 million for stock-based compensation expense. The change in net operating assets of $53.3 million was due primarily to a decrease of $68.2 million in accounts receivable as a result of collection in 2016 of payments related to the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone during 2015 from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The decrease in deferred revenue is due to the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements of $21.3 million. The remaining net change in operating assets which increased cash was a result of an increase in accrued clinical liabilities of $9.6 million offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $1.8 million and accrued liabilities of $3.1 million due to timing of payments.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $75.1 million. The net loss of $85.4 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.6 million for depreciation and amortization and $10.8 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $2.1 million was due primarily to an increase of $70.7 million in accounts receivable and increase of $52.3 million in deferred revenue as result of the achievement of the $70.0 million safety milestone from Celgene based on an analysis of Phase Ib and blinded interim Phase II clinical trial safety data associated with the demcizumab (anti-DLL4, OMP-21M18) program. The increase in deferred revenue is offset by the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $17.7 million. There was also a $7.1 million decrease in tax receivable as result of the receipt of payment and $5.4 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $3.7 million in accrued liabilities, $2.2 million in accounts payable, $1.4 million increase in prepaid and other assets, and $0.7 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $84.5 million. The net loss of $50.0 million was offset by non-cash charges of $1.4 million for depreciation and amortization and $6.2 million for stock-based compensation. The change in net operating assets of $42.1 million was due primarily to a decrease of $35.1 million in deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue for the achievement of a $11.0 million\ndevelopment milestone for dosing the first patient in the Phase II portion of the anti-Notch2/3 ALPINE\u201d clinical trial in the second indication of our tarextumab (anti-Notch2/3, OMP-59R5) program and the amortization of upfront and milestone payments from the GSK, Bayer and Celgene arrangements in the amount of $24.1 million. There was also a $7.1 million increase in tax receivable, $3.9 million increase in accrued clinical liabilities, $1.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $10.8 million decrease in income tax payable, $10.3 million decrease in deferred tax asset, $1.2 million decrease in prepaid and other assets, and $0.6 million decrease in deferred rent.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of purchases of short-term investments amounting to $207.3 million, $128.8 million and $436.9 million, respectively, offset by maturities of short-term investments amounting to $178.7 million, $213.8 million and $340.3 million, respectively. Acquisition of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, amounted to $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of aggregate net proceeds of $63.9 million received from the sale of shares of our common stock through our underwritten public offering that closed on August 23, 2016 and from our at-the-market offering program and aggregate proceeds of $1.2 million received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nCash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Operating leases include total future non-cancelable obligations under operating lease agreement. \nThe Company leases office and laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California under a lease agreement that expires in January 2019 and includes a lease extension option for two additional three-year terms. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company signed an amendment to the lease agreement to extend the lease term through May 2028, with an option to extend the lease for an additional three-year term.\nThe amendment to the lease agreement includes a 10-year cancelable lease agreement for additional office and laboratory space that expires in May 2028, subject to the Company's three-year lease extension option described above. The base rent obligation on this additional space is estimated to commence in June 2018 and the total estimated base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $13.8 million. In addition to the base rent payments, the Company will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for the Company's share of operating expenses and tax obligations. The Company has the right to terminate the lease agreement for this additional space prior to September 16, 2017 and the exercise of such cancelation would not result in an economic penalty to the Company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. See Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Under collaboration agreements, we may receive non-refundable upfront payments, funding for research and development services, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties. In assessing the appropriate revenue recognition related to a collaboration agreement, we first determine whether an arrangement includes multiple elements, such as the delivery of intellectual property rights and research and development services. These multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. The determination of stand-alone value is generally based on whether any deliverable has stand-alone value to the customer. We determine how to allocate arrangement consideration to identified units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy provided under the relevant guidance. The estimated fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence are not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current liabilities.\nWe recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under our collaboration agreements as the services are performed. We record these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis and not as a reduction of research and development expenses, as we have the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities.\nTypically, we have not granted licenses to collaborators at the beginning of our arrangements and thus there are no delivered items separate from the research and development services provided. As such, upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as collaboration revenue over the estimated period of performance that is consistent with the terms of the research and development obligations contained in the collaboration agreement. We regularly review the estimated period of performance based on the progress made under each arrangement. Our estimates of our performance period may change over the course of the research term. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nWhen we enter into an amendment to a collaboration agreement, we evaluate the terms of the amendment relative to the entire arrangement to determine if it constitutes a material modification to the original agreement for financial reporting purposes. We exercise judgment in determining if an amendment is deemed to be a material modification and consider whether there is a change in total consideration, contracted deliverables, the period of the arrangement or the delivery schedule.\nOther contingent payments received for which payment is contingent solely on the results of a collaborative partner's performance are not accounted for using the milestone method. Such bonus payments will be recognized as revenue when collectability is reasonably assured.\nOptions are considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option and the likelihood that the option will be exercised. For arrangements under which an option is considered substantive, we do not consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated opt-in payments are not included in allocable arrangement consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, for arrangements under which an option is not considered substantive or if an option is priced at a significant and incremental discount, we would consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in allocable arrangement consideration. All of the options included in our collaboration arrangements have been determined to be substantive, and none of the options are priced at a significant and incremental discount.\nWe recognize revenue under government contracts and grants when the work is performed or the expenses are incurred. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.\nPreclinical Studies and Clinical Trial Accruals\nWe estimate our preclinical studies and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct these activities on our behalf. In recording service fees, we estimate the time period over which the related services will be performed and compare the level of effort expended through the end of each period to the cumulative expenses recorded and payments made for such services and, as appropriate, accrue additional service fees or defer any non-refundable advance payments until the related services are performed. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust our accrual or deferred advance payment accordingly. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense was $11.1 million, $10.8 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. These assumptions include:\n \u2022 Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We used the simplified method to determine the expected terms as provided by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. \n \u2022 Volatility-The expected volatility is derived from a blend of the historical volatilities of the Company's own common stock and of the common stock of comparable publicly listed biopharmaceutical companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option grants because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock due to no significant trading history. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, and financial leverage in comparison to us. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards. \n \u2022 Expected dividend-The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. \nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and forfeiture rates used for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nPrior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors, with the assistance of management and independent consultants, performed fair value analyses for the valuation of our common stock. For grants made on dates for which there was no contemporaneous valuation to utilize in setting the exercise price of our common stock, and given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO in July 2013, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors, including:\n \u2022 progress of our research and development efforts; \n \u2022 our operating results and financial condition, including our levels of available capital resources; \n \u2022 rights and preferences of our common stock compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity securities; \n \u2022 material risks related to our business; \n \u2022 equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock, such as an initial public offering given prevailing market and biotechnology sector conditions; and \n \u2022 that the grants involved illiquid securities in a private company. \nFor the options granted subsequent to our July 2013 IPO, the exercise price of stock options is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial\nperformance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nNewly Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606, to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective application of ASU 2014-09 with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients to provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, respectively. The effective date for these new standards is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. We expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\nThe adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have a material effect on our financial statements. To date, we have derived our revenues from collaboration agreements. The consideration we are eligible to receive under these agreements includes upfront payments, research and development funding, and milestone payments. Each collaboration agreement is unique and will need to be assessed separately under the five-step process under the new standard. We have started our preliminary assessment of our active license and collaboration agreements. We expect that our evaluation of the accounting for collaboration agreements under the new revenue standard could identify material changes from the current accounting treatment. ASU 2014-09 differs from the current accounting standard in many respects, such as in the accounting for variable consideration, including milestone payments. Under our current accounting policy, we recognize milestone revenue using the milestone method specified in ASC 605-28, which generally results in the recognition of the milestone payment as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved. However, under the new accounting standard, it is possible to start to recognize milestone revenue before the milestone is achieved, subject to management's assessment of whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, the current accounting standards include a presumption that revenue from up-front non-refundable fees would be recognized ratably over the performance period, unless another attribution method was determined to more closely approximate the delivery of the goods or services to the customer. The new accounting standard does not have a presumption that entities would default to a ratable attribution approach and will require entities to determine an appropriate attribution method using either output or input methods. As such, the amount and timing of revenue recognition for our collaboration agreements may change under the new revenue standard.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-15 (Subtopic 205-40) Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether or not there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods therein with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of the standard did not have material impact on our financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases.\u201d ASU 2016-02 amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements, we anticipate recognition of additional assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases on our Balance Sheets.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including the income tax consequences, classification"}
