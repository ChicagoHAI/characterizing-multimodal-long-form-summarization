MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this Annual Report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe,\u201d plan,\u201d intend,\u201d anticipate,\u201d target,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect\u201d and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ( will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report.\nReferences in this section to ViewRay,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company\u201d and our Company\u201d refer to ViewRay, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs previously reported, on July 23, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on July 16, 2015, or the Acquisition Sub, merged with and into ViewRay Technologies, Inc., a corporation incorporated in 2004 in the State of Florida originally under the name of ViewRay Incorporated, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2007. Pursuant to this transaction, or the Merger, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was the surviving corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was converted into shares of our common stock, as described in more detail below.\nAlso as previously reported, immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, we transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation, or the Split-Off Subsidiary, formed on July 16, 2015.\nIn connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, we transferred our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-Merger majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of 4,150,171 shares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business and acquired the business of ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs the result of the Merger and the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the past financial results of the Company is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of ViewRay, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of ViewRay, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 contained herein include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these consolidated financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nCompany Overview\nWe design, manufacture and market MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided radiation therapy system to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously. MRI is a broadly used imaging tool that has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly, unlike X-ray or computed tomography, or CT, which are the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today. MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track the location and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered. These capabilities allow MRIdian to accurately deliver radiation to the tumor while\nreducing the amount delivered to healthy tissue, as compared to other radiation therapy treatments today. We believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery.\nWe received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012. We have the right to affix the CE mark to MRIdian since November 2014, allowing MRIdian to be sold within the European Economic Area. At December 31, 2015, patients had received radiation treatment on MRIdian systems at four cancer centers located at Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea. In December 2015, the fifth MRIdian system was installed at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami and in March 2016, the sixth MRIdian system was installed at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and both are awaiting the start of patient treatment.\nWe currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in the rest of the world. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. Our sales and revenue cycle varies based on the customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months or more from initial customer contact to sales contract execution. Following execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. After the customer completes their customization, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days for us to install MRIdian and perform on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures.\nWe generated product, service and grant revenue of $10.4 million, $6.4 million and $3.2 million, and had net losses of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had 15 signed orders representing backlog value of $84.4 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> continue our research and development efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> seek regulatory approval for MRIdian in foreign countries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> operate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop enhancements to and integrate new technologies into MRI-guided radiation therapy systems.\nMerger\nOn July 23, 2015, ViewRay, Inc. (f/k/a Mirax Corp.), and ViewRay Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a ViewRay Incorporated), consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. contributed all of their equity interests to ViewRay, Inc. for shares of the ViewRay, Inc.'s common stock and merged with the Company's subsidiary, which resulted in ViewRay Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ViewRay, Inc., or the Merger. Effective as of July 23, 2015, ViewRay Inc. amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized common stock to 300,000,000 shares and 10,000,000 shares of blank check\u201d preferred stock, par value of $0.01 per share.\nUpon closing of the Merger, under the terms of the Split-Off Agreement, dated July 23, 2015 among ViewRay, Inc., ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., the acquisition subsidiary of Mirax, and a general release agreement dated July 23, 2015, or the General Release Agreement, ViewRay, Inc. transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary incorporated in Nevada, Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., or the Split-Off Subsidiary. Thereafter, Mirax transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Split-Off Subsidiary to certain pre-Merger insiders of Mirax in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of shares of Mirax common stock held by such persons, or the Split-Off.\nTogether with the Merger, on July 23, 2015, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. effected a 2.975-for-1 stock split of its then outstanding common stock and convertible preferred stock, collectively referred to as Capital Stock, and convertible preferred stock warrants, in which (i) each share of outstanding Capital Stock was increased into 2.975 shares of Capital Stock; (ii) the number of outstanding options to purchase each Capital Stock was proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iii) number of shares reserved for future option grants under the 2008 Plan were proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iv) the exercise price of each such\noutstanding option was proportionately decreased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; and (v) each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock warrant was increased into 2.975 shares of convertible preferred stock warrant. All of the share and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 2.975-for-1 stock split.\nPrivate Placement\nAt the closing of the Merger, ViewRay, Inc. conducted a private placement offering, or the Private Placement, of its securities for $26.3 million through the sale of 5,884,504 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation, at an offering price of $5.00 per share, net of offering cost. Existing ViewRay Technologies, Inc. investors purchased $17.0 million shares of common stock in the Private Placement. Certain shareholders of Mirax retained, after giving effect to the Split-Off, 1,000,005 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation upon the Private Placement.\nThe Merger is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. ViewRay Technologies, Inc. is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and ViewRay, Inc. is the acquired company under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combination. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Merger will be those of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and will be recorded at the historical cost basis, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. up to the day prior to the closing of the Merger and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the Merger.\nNew Orders\nNew orders are defined as the sum of gross product orders recorded during the period.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits received which are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog. Our criteria include an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by customers, receipt of a minimum customer deposit or a letter of credit, any changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions, the customer's or distributor's continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract, changes to regulatory requirements, the status of regulatory approval required in the customer's jurisdiction, if any, or reasons for cancellation of order contracts.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 our new orders were $40.1 million, $37.6 million and $17.4 million respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 15 and 10 signed sales contracts for MRIdian systems in backlog with a total value of $84.4 million and $54.7 million, respectively.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue consists of sales of MRIdian systems, as well as optional components, such as additional planning workstations and body coils.\nFollowing execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. Upon the commencement of installation at a customer's facility, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days to complete the installation and on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrently with installation and acceptance testing. Sales contracts generally include customer deposits upon execution of the agreement, and in certain cases, additional amounts due at shipment or commencement of installation, and final payment due generally upon customer acceptance.\nService Revenue. We generally offer maintenance service at no cost to customers to cover parts, labor and maintenance for one to two years. In addition, we offer multi-year, post-installation maintenance and support contracts that provide various levels of service support, which enables our customers to select the level of on-going support services, including parts and labor, which they require. These post-installation contracts are for a period of one to five years and provide services ranging from 24/7 on-site parts, labor and preventative\nmaintenance to labor only with a longer response time. We also offer technology upgrades to our MRIdian systems, when and if available, for an additional fee. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which the contracted services are provided.\nGrant Revenue. In December 2008, we entered into a loan agreement with the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio to fund the renovation of our Ohio headquarters. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the lender may forgive a portion of the loan if we meet certain permanent job creation requirements within the State of Ohio. Grant revenues are recognized when we meet the employment requirements and receive the loan forgiveness notice from the lender.\nCost of Revenue\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, installation and services associated with the manufacture and installation of MRIdian systems, as well as medical device excise tax and royalty payments to the University of Florida Research Foundation. Product cost of revenue also includes lower of cost or market inventory, or LCM, adjustments if the carrying value of the inventory is greater than its net realizable value. For strategic reasons, we sold our initial MRIdian systems prior to the receipt of FDA marketing clearance at prices lower than our projected costs to manufacture and install. As we accumulated materials, installation and other costs for these systems, we regularly assessed the carrying value of the related inventory value and recorded charges, or LCM adjustments, to reduce inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value. The remaining realizable value of inventory was charged to product cost of revenue as those initial sites were completed and accepted. This resulted in LCM charges of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe expect our materials, installation and service costs to decrease as we continue to scale our operations, improve product designs and work with our third-party suppliers to lower costs.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue is comprised primarily of personnel costs, training and travel expenses to service and maintenance of installed MRIdian systems. Service cost of revenue also includes the costs of replacement parts under maintenance and support contracts.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. Other significant research and development costs arise from development, manufacturing and commercialization of MRIdian. These costs consist of third-party consulting services, laboratory supplies, research materials, medical equipment, computer equipment and licensed technology, and related depreciation and amortization. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. As we continue to invest in improving MRIdian and developing new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel associated with our selling and marketing organization, including our direct sales force and sales management and our marketing and customer support personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs related to trade shows and marketing programs. We expense selling and marketing costs as incurred. We expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales force and our marketing and customer support organization and increase our participation in trade shows and marketing programs.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel, and for our finance, human resources, regulatory and other administrative personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, audit, accounting services, quality and regulatory functions and facilities costs, and gain or loss on the disposal of property and equipment. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company, as well as other costs associated with growing our business.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to our long-term debt in 2013 from Hercules Technology III, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., or together, Hercules, convertible promissory notes\nissued in 2014 and, long-term debt entered in 2015 from Capital Royalty II L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II - Parallel Fund A\u201d L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II (Cayman) L.P. and Parallel Investment Opportunities Partners II L.P., or together with their successors by assignment, CRG, and such loan the CRG Term Loan.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and changes in the fair value of a convertible preferred stock warrant.\nThe outstanding convertible stock warrant is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. In July 2015, upon the closing of the Merger, the convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock. The aggregate fair value of these warrants upon the closing of the Merger was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid-in-capital, a component of stockholders' deficit, and we no longer recorded the change in fair value adjustments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 229: <table> <tr>

<td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to sale of MRIdian system contracts at full price during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the discounted contract price offered during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $9.5 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Hospital at full price, compared to $5.6 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014 related to University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of California, Los Angeles, which were both sold at a discounted price.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to the higher number of months of amortization of service revenue recognized for the MRIdian systems installed at University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGrant Revenue. Grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to our note payable to the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio being forgiven based on meeting certain employment requirements during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to MRIdian systems sold to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, including the $2.6 million of LCM adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the MRIdian systems sold to University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison in year ended December 31, 2014, of which the related LCM adjustment was recorded in 2013.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provision of services for the MRIdian system installed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea, beginning in September 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.0 million, or 11.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in personnel costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $0.5 million increase in engineering and researching expenses as a result of new research and development projects started during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.5 million, or 9.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was a result of an increase of $0.4 million in consulting expenses related to engaging more consulting services for marketing activities, and a $0.2 million increase in employee commissions associated with MRIdian systems installations.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $7.0 million, or 47.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million write-off of deferred offering costs in June 2015, a $2.0 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facility costs as we leased new office space in September 2014, a $0.4 million increase in accounting and legal fees related to our originally planned initial public offering and reverse merger activities, and a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses as a result of engaging more consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,243\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,209\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a higher loan balance related to the CRG Term Loan obtained in June 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net decreased $138 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of foreign exchange loss related to customers' deposit denominated in Euro and vendor payments denominated in Canadian dollar and Euro.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Grant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (894\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in product revenue of $3.7 million and an increase in service revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in grant revenue due to expiration of the Grant Agreement with the State of Ohio in 2013.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the acceptance of a MRIdian system at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, partially offset by the acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to maintenance service revenue recognized for the MRIdian system installed at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013 and the MRIdian system installed at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Cost of Revenue. The change in product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 was insignificant compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $3.6 million in inventory costs related to customer acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis and LCM adjustments of $4.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, product cost of revenue consisted primarily of the release of inventory costs of $5.6 million for accepted MRIdian systems at University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison, additional site preparation and installation costs incurred in 2014 of $2.0 million and LCM adjustments of $0.6 million. The LCM adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of increase in the selling prices of our MRIdian system and decrease in our product costs through a continued effort to improve product design and supply chain management.\nWe currently expect that margins on current orders will continue this trend and show improvements from historic margins. We expect to achieve cost savings of approximately $1.0 million per current system compared to the initial MRIdian systems installed during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. We believe that the combination of higher system prices and lower projected inventory costs as we increase our sales volume and leverage our supplier relationships will enable us to continue to improve our margins.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provisioning of services for the MRIdian system installed at each of Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in project material costs and a $0.2 million increase in travel expenses, offset by a $0.2 million decrease in grant project contractor expense due to the expiration of the State of Ohio grant in April 2013.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, or 24%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.3 million increase in travel-related expenses to promote international sales, a $0.2 million increase in trade show expenses, a $0.2 million increase in public relations and website redesign expenses and a $0.1 million increase in marketing consultant expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $5.2 million, or 55%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in accounting and legal fees, a $1.2 million increase in travel expenses, a $1.2 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $1.0 million increase in regulatory consulting expenses. The change was also attributable to a $0.5 million increase in rent and facility expenses due to our new office lease in Mountain View, California, which commenced during the third quarter of 2014.\nInterest Expense\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,243\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (97\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,146\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily due to the long-term debt we incurred in December 2013.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince ViewRay's inception in 2004 as a Florida corporation, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had net loss of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had an accumulated deficit of $197.0 million and $152.0 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of ViewRay's common stock, private placements of ViewRay's convertible preferred stock, issuances of convertible promissory notes, issuances of term loans and receipts of customer deposits for new orders and payments from customers for systems installed. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash receipts from sales of MRIdian systems, the net proceeds from the Private Placement and the additional available draw down from the CRG Term Loan, will enable us to conduct our planned operations for at least the next 12 months.\nWe could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect, and we may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although we anticipate being able to obtain additional financing through non-dilutive means, we may be unable to do so. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27,469\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,371\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,145\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,593\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nWe have historically experienced negative cash outflows as we developed MRIdian systems and continued to expand our business. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital components as we have grown our business, and is influenced by the timing of cash payments for inventory purchase and cash receipts from our customers. Our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash receipts from customers including sales of MRIdian systems and, to a lesser extent, by up-front payments from customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are amounts due to vendors for purchased components and employee-related expenditures. Our cash flows from operating activities\nwill continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we collect cash receipts from our customers, build up our inventory balances, and increase spending on personnel, and other operating activities as our business grows.\nDuring 2015, operating activities used $39.8 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $45.0 million and $3.7 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $8.8 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred cost of revenue, purchase of inventory, a decrease in accounts payable and making prepaid payments on inventory components, offset by an increase in customer deposits and accrued expenses. The $4.1 million increase in deferred cost of revenue was the result of new MRIdian systems sales orders awaiting installation. This increase also resulted in an increase of $2.4 million in inventory. The $1.1 million increase in deposits on purchased inventory was due to the growth in our business. The decrease of $2.1 million in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The decrease in our operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by $5.3 million increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue, primarily due to new sales contracts, and a $1.5 million increase in accrued expenses attributable to higher accrued inventory purchase. Non-cash charges primarily included $2.9 million for write-off of deferred offering costs, $2.6 million of inventory lower of cost or market charges related to the expected MRIdian system installation in Miami, $1.3 million of depreciation and amortization charges, $1.1 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our debt incurred in December 2013 and June 2015, and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2014, operating activities used $27.5 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $33.8 million, partially offset by a $4.0 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, and aggregate non-cash charges of $2.3 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of higher accounts payable, customer deposits and deferred revenue balances, partially offset by higher deferred costs and accounts receivable balances, increased purchases of inventory, and decreases in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in accounts payable of $4.0 million was due to timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million and the increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue of $10.1 million was primarily due to revenue and new sales order growth in 2014. These changes were offset by a $4.7 million increase in deferred costs and a $3.8 million increase in inventory and deposits on purchased inventory due to installations of MRIdian systems. The decrease of $1.0 million in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was mainly due to a $1.5 million payment of our accrued purchase commitments, offset by a $1.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, higher accrued sales tax and medical device excise tax liabilities, and an increase in accrued interest as a result of debt incurred in December 2013. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.3 million for stock-based compensation, $0.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value and $0.4 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our 2014 convertible promissory notes and debt incurred in December 2013.\nDuring 2013, operating activities used $25.4 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $27.2 million and a $4.3 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $6.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of increased purchases of inventory and lower accounts payable, offset by increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in inventory of $5.2 million and deposits on purchased components of $0.9 million was mainly due to the installation of MRIdian systems. The decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million was due to timing differences in making payments when compared to December 31, 2012. These changes were offset by a $2.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.1 million for depreciation and amortization and $4.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2015 of $4.1 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities during 2014 of $2.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $2.0 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.6 million.\nWe increased our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2015 to support our growing business operations.\nCash used in investing activities during 2013 of $1.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $1.2 million and to purchase an intellectual property license of $0.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn June 2015, we entered the CRG Term Loan for up to $50.0 million, of which $30.0 million was made available to us upon closing with the remaining $20.0 million to be available on or before June 26, 2016 upon meeting certain milestones. On March 24, 2016, the CRG Term Loan was amended such that, with regard to the conditions for borrowing the remaining $20.0 million available under the CRG Term Loan, the Company may, at its election, draw down (i) an amount of either $10.0 million or $15.0 million in up to two advances upon achievement of a minimum of $15.0 million aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before March 31, 2016 and (ii) an additional $5.0 million (or $10.0 million, if the previous draw made was only in an amount of $10.0 million) upon achievement of a minimum of $25.0 million of aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before December 31, 2016 and upon execution of the first sales contract of our second generation product. On March 21, 2016, we achieved the minimum $15.0 million gross revenue requirement which makes the first $15.0 million of the remaining $20.0 million immediately available for draw down. We drew down the first $30.0 million on the closing date. The Term Loan has a maturity date of June 26, 2020 (i.e., 5 years) and bears cash interest at a rate of 12.50% per annum to be paid quarterly during the first three years, or the interest-payment-only period. The interest-payment-only period can be extended for another year until June 26, 2019 if we complete an initial public offering of our common stock on a nationally recognized securities exchange that raises a minimum of $40.0 million in net cash proceeds with a minimum of $120.0 million post money valuation on or before June 26, 2018. During the interest-payment-only period, we have the option to elect to pay only 8% of the 12.5% per annum interest in cash, and the remaining 4.5% of the 12.5% per annum interest as compounded interest, or deferred payment in-kind interest, added to the aggregate principal amount of the CRG Term Loan. Principal payment and any deferred payment in-kind interest will be paid quarterly in equal installments following the end of the interest-payment-only period through the maturity date.\nThe CRG Term Loan is subject to a prepayment penalty of 3% on the outstanding balance during the first 12 months following the funding of the CRG Term Loan, 2% on the outstanding balance after year 1 but on or before year 2, 1% on the outstanding balance after year 2 but on or before year 3, and 0% on the outstanding loan if prepaid after year 3 thereafter until maturity. The CRG Term Loan is also subject to a facility fee of 7% based on the sum of the CRG Term Loan drawn and any outstanding payment in-kind interest payable on the maturity date or the date such CRG Term Loan becomes due for whatever reason. All direct financing costs were accounted for as a discount on the CRG Term Loan and will be amortized to interest expense during the life of the CRG Term Loan using the effective interest method. The CRG Term Loan is subject to financial covenants and is collateralized by essentially all our assets and limits our ability with respect to additional indebtedness, investments or dividends, among other things, subject to customary exceptions.\nOn June 26, 2015, we paid off in full the $15.0 million outstanding term debt with Hercules using part of the proceeds received from the CRG Term Loan.\nDuring 2015, financing activities provided $53.5 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds of $28.9 million related to the draw-down of long-term debt, net of debt issuance cost, the net proceeds of $26.6 million from the Private Placement and the net proceeds of $15.7 million from issuance of Series C convertible preferred stock, which was partially offset by repayments of a term loan of $15.0 million and payments of $2.7 million for costs related to our originally planned initial public offering.\nDuring 2014, financing activities provided $14.7 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible promissory notes of $9.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $5.0 million.\nDuring 2013, financing activities provided $49.4 million in cash from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $34.9 million, net of issuance costs, and net proceeds of $14.5 million related to the term loan we entered into with Hercules in December 2013.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the following assumptions and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for systems that we install generally occurs when the customer acknowledges that the system operates in accordance with our standard product specifications, the customer accepts the installed unit and we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which contracted services are provided. We use judgment to estimate revenue allocations from sales arrangements with multiple deliverables between the product and service revenue. In situations where a deliverable in a multi-element arrangement has a value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, we are required to allocate the fair value of the various elements based on the selling price of each element. The principal deliverables consist of (i) sales of MRIdian systems, which generally includes installation, site preparation and software, and (ii) product support, which includes extended service and maintenance. We determine selling prices using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if it exists, or third-party evidence, or TPE. If neither VSOE nor TPE exists for a deliverable, we use best estimated selling price, or BESP. We allocate revenue to multiple elements generally using the relative fair values as determined by BESP. We regularly review VSOE, TPE and BESP for all of our products and services.\nWe also receive payments for cost reimbursement of allowable expenditures and payments for the achievement of certain milestones under government grants in return for qualifying property and equity purchases and research and development activities over a contractually defined period. These payments are nonrefundable. Government grants generally provide us with fixed payments and a contractually defined period of research. Grant revenues are recognized as associated expenses incurred and are billed to grantors in conjunction with the terms of the grants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years. At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees, net of estimated forfeitures, was $5.2 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCommon Stock Warrant\nIn December 2013 in connection with the Hercules Term Loan, we issued a warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our preferred stock with an exercise price of $5.84 per share, subject to certain adjustments. These warrants were converted to warrant to purchase our common stock upon the closing of the Merger in July 2015. This warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, which is the later of (i) December 16, 2023 and (ii) the date that is five years following the effective date of the registration statement of an initial underwritten public offering of our common stock.\nPrior to the Merger, the preferred stock warrant is recorded as preferred stock warrant liability and adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date, with the change in fair value being recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon the closing of the Merger on July 23, 2015, all shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock, and the warrant to purchase Series C convertible preferred stock was converted into the warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our common stock. Fair value of these warrants at the closing date were reclassified into additional paid-in capital, and we no longer recorded change in fair value adjustment to the converted common stock warrants.\nIn connection with the Merger and the Private Placement, in July and August 2015, we issued 198,760 shares of common stock warrants at an exercise price of $5.00 per share to private placement agents as payment for services provided. These placement\nwarrants are exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until the five year anniversary of its date of issuance. These warrants were accounted for as equity awards.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists primarily of purchased components for assembling MRIdian systems and other direct costs associated with MRIdian system installation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. When the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than related costs, we reduce the carrying value of the inventory for the difference while recording a corresponding charge to cost of product revenues. The assumptions we used in estimating the net realizable value of the inventory primarily include the total cost to complete the applicable MRIdian system. We recorded an inventory lower of cost and market adjustment of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, our inventory cost was measured on a first-in, first-out basis through specific identification. To support the increasing MRIdian system installations and inventory purchase activities, starting January 1, 2015, we elected to change inventory cost measurement to weighted average basis. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on prior periods' financial statements, therefore no retrospective adjustment is required. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on product cost of revenue or net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we calculate deferred tax asset or liability account balances at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect our taxable income.\nWe estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differences in accounting for reporting purposes and tax purposes for certain items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or when net operating loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credit carryforwards can be utilized.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we have a full valuation allowance set up for our net deferred tax assets.\nUnder federal and similar state tax statutes, changes in our ownership, including ownership changes resulting from the Merger, may limit our ability to use our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The annual limitation, as a result of a change of ownership, may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. We believe we have experienced at least one ownership change in the past. We are currently analyzing the tax impact of such ownership change on our federal NOLs and credit carryforwards. Our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience an ownership change or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will have. For the recently issued accounting standards that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, see\nthe section entitled Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the consolidated financial statement.", "summary": "- ViewRay, Inc. (formerly Mirax Corp.) (the \"Company\" or \"ViewRay\") designs, manufactures and markets MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided radiation therapy system that enables surgeons to simultaneously image and treat cancer patients.\n- MRI is a broadly used imaging tool that has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly, unlike X-ray or computed tomography (CT), which are the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today.\n- MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and the Company's proprietary software to locate, target and track the location and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered.\n- These capabilities allow MRIdian to accurately deliver radiation to the tumor while reducing the amount delivered to healthy tissue, as compared to other radiation therapy treatments today.\n- We believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery.\n- We received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012.", "item_7_tables": "Table 229: <table> <tr>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this Annual Report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe,\u201d plan,\u201d intend,\u201d anticipate,\u201d target,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect\u201d and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ( will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report.\nReferences in this section to ViewRay,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company\u201d and our Company\u201d refer to ViewRay, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs previously reported, on July 23, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on July 16, 2015, or the Acquisition Sub, merged with and into ViewRay Technologies, Inc., a corporation incorporated in 2004 in the State of Florida originally under the name of ViewRay Incorporated, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2007. Pursuant to this transaction, or the Merger, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was the surviving corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was converted into shares of our common stock, as described in more detail below.\nAlso as previously reported, immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, we transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation, or the Split-Off Subsidiary, formed on July 16, 2015.\nIn connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, we transferred our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-Merger majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of 4,150,171 shares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business and acquired the business of ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs the result of the Merger and the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the past financial results of the Company is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of ViewRay, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of ViewRay, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 contained herein include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these consolidated financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nCompany Overview\nWe design, manufacture and market MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided radiation therapy system to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously. MRI is a broadly used imaging tool that has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly, unlike X-ray or computed tomography, or CT, which are the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today. MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track the location and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered. These capabilities allow MRIdian to accurately deliver radiation to the tumor while\nreducing the amount delivered to healthy tissue, as compared to other radiation therapy treatments today. We believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery.\nWe received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012. We have the right to affix the CE mark to MRIdian since November 2014, allowing MRIdian to be sold within the European Economic Area. At December 31, 2015, patients had received radiation treatment on MRIdian systems at four cancer centers located at Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea. In December 2015, the fifth MRIdian system was installed at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami and in March 2016, the sixth MRIdian system was installed at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and both are awaiting the start of patient treatment.\nWe currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in the rest of the world. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. Our sales and revenue cycle varies based on the customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months or more from initial customer contact to sales contract execution. Following execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. After the customer completes their customization, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days for us to install MRIdian and perform on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures.\nWe generated product, service and grant revenue of $10.4 million, $6.4 million and $3.2 million, and had net losses of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had 15 signed orders representing backlog value of $84.4 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u00b7 add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts; \n \u00b7 continue our research and development efforts; \n \u00b7 seek regulatory approval for MRIdian in foreign countries; and \n \u00b7 operate as a public company. \nAccordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop enhancements to and integrate new technologies into MRI-guided radiation therapy systems.\nMerger\nOn July 23, 2015, ViewRay, Inc. (f/k/a Mirax Corp.), and ViewRay Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a ViewRay Incorporated), consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. contributed all of their equity interests to ViewRay, Inc. for shares of the ViewRay, Inc.'s common stock and merged with the Company's subsidiary, which resulted in ViewRay Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ViewRay, Inc., or the Merger. Effective as of July 23, 2015, ViewRay Inc. amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized common stock to 300,000,000 shares and 10,000,000 shares of blank check\u201d preferred stock, par value of $0.01 per share.\nUpon closing of the Merger, under the terms of the Split-Off Agreement, dated July 23, 2015 among ViewRay, Inc., ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., the acquisition subsidiary of Mirax, and a general release agreement dated July 23, 2015, or the General Release Agreement, ViewRay, Inc. transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary incorporated in Nevada, Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., or the Split-Off Subsidiary. Thereafter, Mirax transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Split-Off Subsidiary to certain pre-Merger insiders of Mirax in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of shares of Mirax common stock held by such persons, or the Split-Off.\nTogether with the Merger, on July 23, 2015, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. effected a 2.975-for-1 stock split of its then outstanding common stock and convertible preferred stock, collectively referred to as Capital Stock, and convertible preferred stock warrants, in which (i) each share of outstanding Capital Stock was increased into 2.975 shares of Capital Stock; (ii) the number of outstanding options to purchase each Capital Stock was proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iii) number of shares reserved for future option grants under the 2008 Plan were proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iv) the exercise price of each such\noutstanding option was proportionately decreased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; and (v) each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock warrant was increased into 2.975 shares of convertible preferred stock warrant. All of the share and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 2.975-for-1 stock split.\nPrivate Placement\nAt the closing of the Merger, ViewRay, Inc. conducted a private placement offering, or the Private Placement, of its securities for $26.3 million through the sale of 5,884,504 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation, at an offering price of $5.00 per share, net of offering cost. Existing ViewRay Technologies, Inc. investors purchased $17.0 million shares of common stock in the Private Placement. Certain shareholders of Mirax retained, after giving effect to the Split-Off, 1,000,005 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation upon the Private Placement.\nThe Merger is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. ViewRay Technologies, Inc. is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and ViewRay, Inc. is the acquired company under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combination. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Merger will be those of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and will be recorded at the historical cost basis, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. up to the day prior to the closing of the Merger and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the Merger.\nNew Orders\nNew orders are defined as the sum of gross product orders recorded during the period.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits received which are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog. Our criteria include an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by customers, receipt of a minimum customer deposit or a letter of credit, any changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions, the customer's or distributor's continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract, changes to regulatory requirements, the status of regulatory approval required in the customer's jurisdiction, if any, or reasons for cancellation of order contracts.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 our new orders were $40.1 million, $37.6 million and $17.4 million respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 15 and 10 signed sales contracts for MRIdian systems in backlog with a total value of $84.4 million and $54.7 million, respectively.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue consists of sales of MRIdian systems, as well as optional components, such as additional planning workstations and body coils.\nFollowing execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. Upon the commencement of installation at a customer's facility, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days to complete the installation and on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrently with installation and acceptance testing. Sales contracts generally include customer deposits upon execution of the agreement, and in certain cases, additional amounts due at shipment or commencement of installation, and final payment due generally upon customer acceptance.\nService Revenue. We generally offer maintenance service at no cost to customers to cover parts, labor and maintenance for one to two years. In addition, we offer multi-year, post-installation maintenance and support contracts that provide various levels of service support, which enables our customers to select the level of on-going support services, including parts and labor, which they require. These post-installation contracts are for a period of one to five years and provide services ranging from 24/7 on-site parts, labor and preventative\nmaintenance to labor only with a longer response time. We also offer technology upgrades to our MRIdian systems, when and if available, for an additional fee. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which the contracted services are provided.\nGrant Revenue. In December 2008, we entered into a loan agreement with the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio to fund the renovation of our Ohio headquarters. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the lender may forgive a portion of the loan if we meet certain permanent job creation requirements within the State of Ohio. Grant revenues are recognized when we meet the employment requirements and receive the loan forgiveness notice from the lender.\nCost of Revenue\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, installation and services associated with the manufacture and installation of MRIdian systems, as well as medical device excise tax and royalty payments to the University of Florida Research Foundation. Product cost of revenue also includes lower of cost or market inventory, or LCM, adjustments if the carrying value of the inventory is greater than its net realizable value. For strategic reasons, we sold our initial MRIdian systems prior to the receipt of FDA marketing clearance at prices lower than our projected costs to manufacture and install. As we accumulated materials, installation and other costs for these systems, we regularly assessed the carrying value of the related inventory value and recorded charges, or LCM adjustments, to reduce inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value. The remaining realizable value of inventory was charged to product cost of revenue as those initial sites were completed and accepted. This resulted in LCM charges of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe expect our materials, installation and service costs to decrease as we continue to scale our operations, improve product designs and work with our third-party suppliers to lower costs.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue is comprised primarily of personnel costs, training and travel expenses to service and maintenance of installed MRIdian systems. Service cost of revenue also includes the costs of replacement parts under maintenance and support contracts.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. Other significant research and development costs arise from development, manufacturing and commercialization of MRIdian. These costs consist of third-party consulting services, laboratory supplies, research materials, medical equipment, computer equipment and licensed technology, and related depreciation and amortization. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. As we continue to invest in improving MRIdian and developing new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel associated with our selling and marketing organization, including our direct sales force and sales management and our marketing and customer support personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs related to trade shows and marketing programs. We expense selling and marketing costs as incurred. We expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales force and our marketing and customer support organization and increase our participation in trade shows and marketing programs.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel, and for our finance, human resources, regulatory and other administrative personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, audit, accounting services, quality and regulatory functions and facilities costs, and gain or loss on the disposal of property and equipment. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company, as well as other costs associated with growing our business.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to our long-term debt in 2013 from Hercules Technology III, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., or together, Hercules, convertible promissory notes\nissued in 2014 and, long-term debt entered in 2015 from Capital Royalty II L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II - Parallel Fund A\u201d L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II (Cayman) L.P. and Parallel Investment Opportunities Partners II L.P., or together with their successors by assignment, CRG, and such loan the CRG Term Loan.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and changes in the fair value of a convertible preferred stock warrant.\nThe outstanding convertible stock warrant is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. In July 2015, upon the closing of the Merger, the convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock. The aggregate fair value of these warrants upon the closing of the Merger was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid-in-capital, a component of stockholders' deficit, and we no longer recorded the change in fair value adjustments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to sale of MRIdian system contracts at full price during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the discounted contract price offered during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $9.5 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Hospital at full price, compared to $5.6 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014 related to University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of California, Los Angeles, which were both sold at a discounted price.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to the higher number of months of amortization of service revenue recognized for the MRIdian systems installed at University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGrant Revenue. Grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to our note payable to the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio being forgiven based on meeting certain employment requirements during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue\n\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to MRIdian systems sold to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, including the $2.6 million of LCM adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the MRIdian systems sold to University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison in year ended December 31, 2014, of which the related LCM adjustment was recorded in 2013.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provision of services for the MRIdian system installed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea, beginning in September 2015.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.0 million, or 11.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in personnel costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $0.5 million increase in engineering and researching expenses as a result of new research and development projects started during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.5 million, or 9.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was a result of an increase of $0.4 million in consulting expenses related to engaging more consulting services for marketing activities, and a $0.2 million increase in employee commissions associated with MRIdian systems installations.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $7.0 million, or 47.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million write-off of deferred offering costs in June 2015, a $2.0 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facility costs as we leased new office space in September 2014, a $0.4 million increase in accounting and legal fees related to our originally planned initial public offering and reverse merger activities, and a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses as a result of engaging more consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a higher loan balance related to the CRG Term Loan obtained in June 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net decreased $138 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of foreign exchange loss related to customers' deposit denominated in Euro and vendor payments denominated in Canadian dollar and Euro.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in product revenue of $3.7 million and an increase in service revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in grant revenue due to expiration of the Grant Agreement with the State of Ohio in 2013.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the acceptance of a MRIdian system at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, partially offset by the acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to maintenance service revenue recognized for the MRIdian system installed at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013 and the MRIdian system installed at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014.\nCost of Revenue\n\nProduct Cost of Revenue. The change in product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 was insignificant compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $3.6 million in inventory costs related to customer acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis and LCM adjustments of $4.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, product cost of revenue consisted primarily of the release of inventory costs of $5.6 million for accepted MRIdian systems at University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison, additional site preparation and installation costs incurred in 2014 of $2.0 million and LCM adjustments of $0.6 million. The LCM adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of increase in the selling prices of our MRIdian system and decrease in our product costs through a continued effort to improve product design and supply chain management.\nWe currently expect that margins on current orders will continue this trend and show improvements from historic margins. We expect to achieve cost savings of approximately $1.0 million per current system compared to the initial MRIdian systems installed during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. We believe that the combination of higher system prices and lower projected inventory costs as we increase our sales volume and leverage our supplier relationships will enable us to continue to improve our margins.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provisioning of services for the MRIdian system installed at each of Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in project material costs and a $0.2 million increase in travel expenses, offset by a $0.2 million decrease in grant project contractor expense due to the expiration of the State of Ohio grant in April 2013.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, or 24%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.3 million increase in travel-related expenses to promote international sales, a $0.2 million increase in trade show expenses, a $0.2 million increase in public relations and website redesign expenses and a $0.1 million increase in marketing consultant expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $5.2 million, or 55%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in accounting and legal fees, a $1.2 million increase in travel expenses, a $1.2 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $1.0 million increase in regulatory consulting expenses. The change was also attributable to a $0.5 million increase in rent and facility expenses due to our new office lease in Mountain View, California, which commenced during the third quarter of 2014.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily due to the long-term debt we incurred in December 2013.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince ViewRay's inception in 2004 as a Florida corporation, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had net loss of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had an accumulated deficit of $197.0 million and $152.0 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of ViewRay's common stock, private placements of ViewRay's convertible preferred stock, issuances of convertible promissory notes, issuances of term loans and receipts of customer deposits for new orders and payments from customers for systems installed. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash receipts from sales of MRIdian systems, the net proceeds from the Private Placement and the additional available draw down from the CRG Term Loan, will enable us to conduct our planned operations for at least the next 12 months.\nWe could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect, and we may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although we anticipate being able to obtain additional financing through non-dilutive means, we may be unable to do so. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nWe have historically experienced negative cash outflows as we developed MRIdian systems and continued to expand our business. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital components as we have grown our business, and is influenced by the timing of cash payments for inventory purchase and cash receipts from our customers. Our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash receipts from customers including sales of MRIdian systems and, to a lesser extent, by up-front payments from customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are amounts due to vendors for purchased components and employee-related expenditures. Our cash flows from operating activities\nwill continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we collect cash receipts from our customers, build up our inventory balances, and increase spending on personnel, and other operating activities as our business grows.\nDuring 2015, operating activities used $39.8 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $45.0 million and $3.7 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $8.8 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred cost of revenue, purchase of inventory, a decrease in accounts payable and making prepaid payments on inventory components, offset by an increase in customer deposits and accrued expenses. The $4.1 million increase in deferred cost of revenue was the result of new MRIdian systems sales orders awaiting installation. This increase also resulted in an increase of $2.4 million in inventory. The $1.1 million increase in deposits on purchased inventory was due to the growth in our business. The decrease of $2.1 million in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The decrease in our operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by $5.3 million increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue, primarily due to new sales contracts, and a $1.5 million increase in accrued expenses attributable to higher accrued inventory purchase. Non-cash charges primarily included $2.9 million for write-off of deferred offering costs, $2.6 million of inventory lower of cost or market charges related to the expected MRIdian system installation in Miami, $1.3 million of depreciation and amortization charges, $1.1 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our debt incurred in December 2013 and June 2015, and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2014, operating activities used $27.5 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $33.8 million, partially offset by a $4.0 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, and aggregate non-cash charges of $2.3 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of higher accounts payable, customer deposits and deferred revenue balances, partially offset by higher deferred costs and accounts receivable balances, increased purchases of inventory, and decreases in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in accounts payable of $4.0 million was due to timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million and the increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue of $10.1 million was primarily due to revenue and new sales order growth in 2014. These changes were offset by a $4.7 million increase in deferred costs and a $3.8 million increase in inventory and deposits on purchased inventory due to installations of MRIdian systems. The decrease of $1.0 million in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was mainly due to a $1.5 million payment of our accrued purchase commitments, offset by a $1.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, higher accrued sales tax and medical device excise tax liabilities, and an increase in accrued interest as a result of debt incurred in December 2013. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.3 million for stock-based compensation, $0.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value and $0.4 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our 2014 convertible promissory notes and debt incurred in December 2013.\nDuring 2013, operating activities used $25.4 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $27.2 million and a $4.3 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $6.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of increased purchases of inventory and lower accounts payable, offset by increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in inventory of $5.2 million and deposits on purchased components of $0.9 million was mainly due to the installation of MRIdian systems. The decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million was due to timing differences in making payments when compared to December 31, 2012. These changes were offset by a $2.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.1 million for depreciation and amortization and $4.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2015 of $4.1 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities during 2014 of $2.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $2.0 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.6 million.\nWe increased our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2015 to support our growing business operations.\nCash used in investing activities during 2013 of $1.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $1.2 million and to purchase an intellectual property license of $0.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn June 2015, we entered the CRG Term Loan for up to $50.0 million, of which $30.0 million was made available to us upon closing with the remaining $20.0 million to be available on or before June 26, 2016 upon meeting certain milestones. On March 24, 2016, the CRG Term Loan was amended such that, with regard to the conditions for borrowing the remaining $20.0 million available under the CRG Term Loan, the Company may, at its election, draw down (i) an amount of either $10.0 million or $15.0 million in up to two advances upon achievement of a minimum of $15.0 million aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before March 31, 2016 and (ii) an additional $5.0 million (or $10.0 million, if the previous draw made was only in an amount of $10.0 million) upon achievement of a minimum of $25.0 million of aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before December 31, 2016 and upon execution of the first sales contract of our second generation product. On March 21, 2016, we achieved the minimum $15.0 million gross revenue requirement which makes the first $15.0 million of the remaining $20.0 million immediately available for draw down. We drew down the first $30.0 million on the closing date. The Term Loan has a maturity date of June 26, 2020 (i.e., 5 years) and bears cash interest at a rate of 12.50% per annum to be paid quarterly during the first three years, or the interest-payment-only period. The interest-payment-only period can be extended for another year until June 26, 2019 if we complete an initial public offering of our common stock on a nationally recognized securities exchange that raises a minimum of $40.0 million in net cash proceeds with a minimum of $120.0 million post money valuation on or before June 26, 2018. During the interest-payment-only period, we have the option to elect to pay only 8% of the 12.5% per annum interest in cash, and the remaining 4.5% of the 12.5% per annum interest as compounded interest, or deferred payment in-kind interest, added to the aggregate principal amount of the CRG Term Loan. Principal payment and any deferred payment in-kind interest will be paid quarterly in equal installments following the end of the interest-payment-only period through the maturity date.\nThe CRG Term Loan is subject to a prepayment penalty of 3% on the outstanding balance during the first 12 months following the funding of the CRG Term Loan, 2% on the outstanding balance after year 1 but on or before year 2, 1% on the outstanding balance after year 2 but on or before year 3, and 0% on the outstanding loan if prepaid after year 3 thereafter until maturity. The CRG Term Loan is also subject to a facility fee of 7% based on the sum of the CRG Term Loan drawn and any outstanding payment in-kind interest payable on the maturity date or the date such CRG Term Loan becomes due for whatever reason. All direct financing costs were accounted for as a discount on the CRG Term Loan and will be amortized to interest expense during the life of the CRG Term Loan using the effective interest method. The CRG Term Loan is subject to financial covenants and is collateralized by essentially all our assets and limits our ability with respect to additional indebtedness, investments or dividends, among other things, subject to customary exceptions.\nOn June 26, 2015, we paid off in full the $15.0 million outstanding term debt with Hercules using part of the proceeds received from the CRG Term Loan.\nDuring 2015, financing activities provided $53.5 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds of $28.9 million related to the draw-down of long-term debt, net of debt issuance cost, the net proceeds of $26.6 million from the Private Placement and the net proceeds of $15.7 million from issuance of Series C convertible preferred stock, which was partially offset by repayments of a term loan of $15.0 million and payments of $2.7 million for costs related to our originally planned initial public offering.\nDuring 2014, financing activities provided $14.7 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible promissory notes of $9.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $5.0 million.\nDuring 2013, financing activities provided $49.4 million in cash from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $34.9 million, net of issuance costs, and net proceeds of $14.5 million related to the term loan we entered into with Hercules in December 2013.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the following assumptions and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for systems that we install generally occurs when the customer acknowledges that the system operates in accordance with our standard product specifications, the customer accepts the installed unit and we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which contracted services are provided. We use judgment to estimate revenue allocations from sales arrangements with multiple deliverables between the product and service revenue. In situations where a deliverable in a multi-element arrangement has a value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, we are required to allocate the fair value of the various elements based on the selling price of each element. The principal deliverables consist of (i) sales of MRIdian systems, which generally includes installation, site preparation and software, and (ii) product support, which includes extended service and maintenance. We determine selling prices using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if it exists, or third-party evidence, or TPE. If neither VSOE nor TPE exists for a deliverable, we use best estimated selling price, or BESP. We allocate revenue to multiple elements generally using the relative fair values as determined by BESP. We regularly review VSOE, TPE and BESP for all of our products and services.\nWe also receive payments for cost reimbursement of allowable expenditures and payments for the achievement of certain milestones under government grants in return for qualifying property and equity purchases and research and development activities over a contractually defined period. These payments are nonrefundable. Government grants generally provide us with fixed payments and a contractually defined period of research. Grant revenues are recognized as associated expenses incurred and are billed to grantors in conjunction with the terms of the grants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years. At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees, net of estimated forfeitures, was $5.2 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCommon Stock Warrant\nIn December 2013 in connection with the Hercules Term Loan, we issued a warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our preferred stock with an exercise price of $5.84 per share, subject to certain adjustments. These warrants were converted to warrant to purchase our common stock upon the closing of the Merger in July 2015. This warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, which is the later of (i) December 16, 2023 and (ii) the date that is five years following the effective date of the registration statement of an initial underwritten public offering of our common stock.\nPrior to the Merger, the preferred stock warrant is recorded as preferred stock warrant liability and adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date, with the change in fair value being recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon the closing of the Merger on July 23, 2015, all shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock, and the warrant to purchase Series C convertible preferred stock was converted into the warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our common stock. Fair value of these warrants at the closing date were reclassified into additional paid-in capital, and we no longer recorded change in fair value adjustment to the converted common stock warrants.\nIn connection with the Merger and the Private Placement, in July and August 2015, we issued 198,760 shares of common stock warrants at an exercise price of $5.00 per share to private placement agents as payment for services provided. These placement\nwarrants are exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until the five year anniversary of its date of issuance. These warrants were accounted for as equity awards.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists primarily of purchased components for assembling MRIdian systems and other direct costs associated with MRIdian system installation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. When the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than related costs, we reduce the carrying value of the inventory for the difference while recording a corresponding charge to cost of product revenues. The assumptions we used in estimating the net realizable value of the inventory primarily include the total cost to complete the applicable MRIdian system. We recorded an inventory lower of cost and market adjustment of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, our inventory cost was measured on a first-in, first-out basis through specific identification. To support the increasing MRIdian system installations and inventory purchase activities, starting January 1, 2015, we elected to change inventory cost measurement to weighted average basis. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on prior periods' financial statements, therefore no retrospective adjustment is required. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on product cost of revenue or net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we calculate deferred tax asset or liability account balances at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect our taxable income.\nWe estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differences in accounting for reporting purposes and tax purposes for certain items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or when net operating loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credit carryforwards can be utilized.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we have a full valuation allowance set up for our net deferred tax assets.\nUnder federal and similar state tax statutes, changes in our ownership, including ownership changes resulting from the Merger, may limit our ability to use our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The annual limitation, as a result of a change of ownership, may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. We believe we have experienced at least one ownership change in the past. We are currently analyzing the tax impact of such ownership change on our federal NOLs and credit carryforwards. Our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience an ownership change or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this Annual Report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe,\u201d plan,\u201d intend,\u201d anticipate,\u201d target,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect\u201d and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ( will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report.\nReferences in this section to ViewRay,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d the Company\u201d and our Company\u201d refer to ViewRay, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary, ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs previously reported, on July 23, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on July 16, 2015, or the Acquisition Sub, merged with and into ViewRay Technologies, Inc., a corporation incorporated in 2004 in the State of Florida originally under the name of ViewRay Incorporated, subsequently reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2007. Pursuant to this transaction, or the Merger, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was the surviving corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding capital stock of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. was converted into shares of our common stock, as described in more detail below.\nAlso as previously reported, immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a split-off agreement, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, we transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to its wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, Vesuvius Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation, or the Split-Off Subsidiary, formed on July 16, 2015.\nIn connection with the Merger and pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, we transferred our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-Merger majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of 4,150,171 shares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business and acquired the business of ViewRay Technologies, Inc.\nAs the result of the Merger and the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the past financial results of the Company is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of ViewRay, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.\nThe following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of ViewRay, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 contained herein include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these consolidated financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nCompany Overview\nWe design, manufacture and market MRIdian, the first and only MRI-guided radiation therapy system to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously. MRI is a broadly used imaging tool that has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly, unlike X-ray or computed tomography, or CT, which are the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today. MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track the location and shape of soft-tissue tumors while radiation is delivered. These capabilities allow MRIdian to accurately deliver radiation to the tumor while\nreducing the amount delivered to healthy tissue, as compared to other radiation therapy treatments today. We believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from off-target radiation delivery.\nWe received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012. We have the right to affix the CE mark to MRIdian since November 2014, allowing MRIdian to be sold within the European Economic Area. At December 31, 2015, patients had received radiation treatment on MRIdian systems at four cancer centers located at Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea. In December 2015, the fifth MRIdian system was installed at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami and in March 2016, the sixth MRIdian system was installed at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, and both are awaiting the start of patient treatment.\nWe currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and distributors in the rest of the world. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. Our sales and revenue cycle varies based on the customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months or more from initial customer contact to sales contract execution. Following execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. After the customer completes their customization, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days for us to install MRIdian and perform on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures.\nWe generated product, service and grant revenue of $10.4 million, $6.4 million and $3.2 million, and had net losses of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had 15 signed orders representing backlog value of $84.4 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u00b7 add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts; \n \u00b7 continue our research and development efforts; \n \u00b7 seek regulatory approval for MRIdian in foreign countries; and \n \u00b7 operate as a public company. \nAccordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop enhancements to and integrate new technologies into MRI-guided radiation therapy systems.\nMerger\nOn July 23, 2015, ViewRay, Inc. (f/k/a Mirax Corp.), and ViewRay Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a ViewRay Incorporated), consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. contributed all of their equity interests to ViewRay, Inc. for shares of the ViewRay, Inc.'s common stock and merged with the Company's subsidiary, which resulted in ViewRay Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ViewRay, Inc., or the Merger. Effective as of July 23, 2015, ViewRay Inc. amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized common stock to 300,000,000 shares and 10,000,000 shares of blank check\u201d preferred stock, par value of $0.01 per share.\nUpon closing of the Merger, under the terms of the Split-Off Agreement, dated July 23, 2015 among ViewRay, Inc., ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., the acquisition subsidiary of Mirax, and a general release agreement dated July 23, 2015, or the General Release Agreement, ViewRay, Inc. transferred all of its pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary incorporated in Nevada, Vesuvius Acquisition Sub, Inc., or the Split-Off Subsidiary. Thereafter, Mirax transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Split-Off Subsidiary to certain pre-Merger insiders of Mirax in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of shares of Mirax common stock held by such persons, or the Split-Off.\nTogether with the Merger, on July 23, 2015, ViewRay Technologies, Inc. effected a 2.975-for-1 stock split of its then outstanding common stock and convertible preferred stock, collectively referred to as Capital Stock, and convertible preferred stock warrants, in which (i) each share of outstanding Capital Stock was increased into 2.975 shares of Capital Stock; (ii) the number of outstanding options to purchase each Capital Stock was proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iii) number of shares reserved for future option grants under the 2008 Plan were proportionately increased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; (iv) the exercise price of each such\noutstanding option was proportionately decreased on a 2.975-for-1 basis; and (v) each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock warrant was increased into 2.975 shares of convertible preferred stock warrant. All of the share and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 2.975-for-1 stock split.\nPrivate Placement\nAt the closing of the Merger, ViewRay, Inc. conducted a private placement offering, or the Private Placement, of its securities for $26.3 million through the sale of 5,884,504 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation, at an offering price of $5.00 per share, net of offering cost. Existing ViewRay Technologies, Inc. investors purchased $17.0 million shares of common stock in the Private Placement. Certain shareholders of Mirax retained, after giving effect to the Split-Off, 1,000,005 shares of the common stock of the surviving corporation upon the Private Placement.\nThe Merger is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. ViewRay Technologies, Inc. is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and ViewRay, Inc. is the acquired company under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combination. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Merger will be those of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. and will be recorded at the historical cost basis, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of ViewRay Technologies, Inc. up to the day prior to the closing of the Merger and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the Merger.\nNew Orders\nNew orders are defined as the sum of gross product orders recorded during the period.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits received which are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog. Our criteria include an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by customers, receipt of a minimum customer deposit or a letter of credit, any changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions, the customer's or distributor's continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract, changes to regulatory requirements, the status of regulatory approval required in the customer's jurisdiction, if any, or reasons for cancellation of order contracts.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 our new orders were $40.1 million, $37.6 million and $17.4 million respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 15 and 10 signed sales contracts for MRIdian systems in backlog with a total value of $84.4 million and $54.7 million, respectively.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue consists of sales of MRIdian systems, as well as optional components, such as additional planning workstations and body coils.\nFollowing execution of a sales contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. Upon the commencement of installation at a customer's facility, it typically takes forty-five to ninety days to complete the installation and on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrently with installation and acceptance testing. Sales contracts generally include customer deposits upon execution of the agreement, and in certain cases, additional amounts due at shipment or commencement of installation, and final payment due generally upon customer acceptance.\nService Revenue. We generally offer maintenance service at no cost to customers to cover parts, labor and maintenance for one to two years. In addition, we offer multi-year, post-installation maintenance and support contracts that provide various levels of service support, which enables our customers to select the level of on-going support services, including parts and labor, which they require. These post-installation contracts are for a period of one to five years and provide services ranging from 24/7 on-site parts, labor and preventative\nmaintenance to labor only with a longer response time. We also offer technology upgrades to our MRIdian systems, when and if available, for an additional fee. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which the contracted services are provided.\nGrant Revenue. In December 2008, we entered into a loan agreement with the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio to fund the renovation of our Ohio headquarters. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the lender may forgive a portion of the loan if we meet certain permanent job creation requirements within the State of Ohio. Grant revenues are recognized when we meet the employment requirements and receive the loan forgiveness notice from the lender.\nCost of Revenue\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of materials, installation and services associated with the manufacture and installation of MRIdian systems, as well as medical device excise tax and royalty payments to the University of Florida Research Foundation. Product cost of revenue also includes lower of cost or market inventory, or LCM, adjustments if the carrying value of the inventory is greater than its net realizable value. For strategic reasons, we sold our initial MRIdian systems prior to the receipt of FDA marketing clearance at prices lower than our projected costs to manufacture and install. As we accumulated materials, installation and other costs for these systems, we regularly assessed the carrying value of the related inventory value and recorded charges, or LCM adjustments, to reduce inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value. The remaining realizable value of inventory was charged to product cost of revenue as those initial sites were completed and accepted. This resulted in LCM charges of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe expect our materials, installation and service costs to decrease as we continue to scale our operations, improve product designs and work with our third-party suppliers to lower costs.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue is comprised primarily of personnel costs, training and travel expenses to service and maintenance of installed MRIdian systems. Service cost of revenue also includes the costs of replacement parts under maintenance and support contracts.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. Other significant research and development costs arise from development, manufacturing and commercialization of MRIdian. These costs consist of third-party consulting services, laboratory supplies, research materials, medical equipment, computer equipment and licensed technology, and related depreciation and amortization. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. As we continue to invest in improving MRIdian and developing new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel associated with our selling and marketing organization, including our direct sales force and sales management and our marketing and customer support personnel. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs related to trade shows and marketing programs. We expense selling and marketing costs as incurred. We expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as we expand our sales force and our marketing and customer support organization and increase our participation in trade shows and marketing programs.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel, and for our finance, human resources, regulatory and other administrative personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, audit, accounting services, quality and regulatory functions and facilities costs, and gain or loss on the disposal of property and equipment. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company, as well as other costs associated with growing our business.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to our long-term debt in 2013 from Hercules Technology III, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., or together, Hercules, convertible promissory notes\nissued in 2014 and, long-term debt entered in 2015 from Capital Royalty II L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II - Parallel Fund A\u201d L.P., Capital Royalty Partners II (Cayman) L.P. and Parallel Investment Opportunities Partners II L.P., or together with their successors by assignment, CRG, and such loan the CRG Term Loan.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and changes in the fair value of a convertible preferred stock warrant.\nThe outstanding convertible stock warrant is re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. In July 2015, upon the closing of the Merger, the convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock. The aggregate fair value of these warrants upon the closing of the Merger was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid-in-capital, a component of stockholders' deficit, and we no longer recorded the change in fair value adjustments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 229: <table> <tr>

<td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to sale of MRIdian system contracts at full price during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the discounted contract price offered during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $9.5 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Hospital at full price, compared to $5.6 million of system revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014 related to University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of California, Los Angeles, which were both sold at a discounted price.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to the higher number of months of amortization of service revenue recognized for the MRIdian systems installed at University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGrant Revenue. Grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to our note payable to the county redevelopment fund in the State of Ohio being forgiven based on meeting certain employment requirements during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Cost of Revenue. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to MRIdian systems sold to Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, including the $2.6 million of LCM adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the MRIdian systems sold to University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison in year ended December 31, 2014, of which the related LCM adjustment was recorded in 2013.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provision of services for the MRIdian system installed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea, beginning in September 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.0 million, or 11.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.6 million increase in personnel costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $0.5 million increase in engineering and researching expenses as a result of new research and development projects started during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.5 million, or 9.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was a result of an increase of $0.4 million in consulting expenses related to engaging more consulting services for marketing activities, and a $0.2 million increase in employee commissions associated with MRIdian systems installations.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $7.0 million, or 47.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million write-off of deferred offering costs in June 2015, a $2.0 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facility costs as we leased new office space in September 2014, a $0.4 million increase in accounting and legal fees related to our originally planned initial public offering and reverse merger activities, and a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses as a result of engaging more consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,452\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,243\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,209\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a higher loan balance related to the CRG Term Loan obtained in June 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net decreased $138 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of foreign exchange loss related to customers' deposit denominated in Euro and vendor payments denominated in Canadian dollar and Euro.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Grant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (894\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in product revenue of $3.7 million and an increase in service revenue of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in grant revenue due to expiration of the Grant Agreement with the State of Ohio in 2013.\nProduct Revenue. Product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the acceptance of a MRIdian system at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, partially offset by the acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013.\nService Revenue. Service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to maintenance service revenue recognized for the MRIdian system installed at Washington University in St. Louis in 2013 and the MRIdian system installed at each of University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Cost of Revenue. The change in product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 was insignificant compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Product cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $3.6 million in inventory costs related to customer acceptance of a MRIdian system at Washington University in St. Louis and LCM adjustments of $4.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, product cost of revenue consisted primarily of the release of inventory costs of $5.6 million for accepted MRIdian systems at University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison, additional site preparation and installation costs incurred in 2014 of $2.0 million and LCM adjustments of $0.6 million. The LCM adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $4.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of increase in the selling prices of our MRIdian system and decrease in our product costs through a continued effort to improve product design and supply chain management.\nWe currently expect that margins on current orders will continue this trend and show improvements from historic margins. We expect to achieve cost savings of approximately $1.0 million per current system compared to the initial MRIdian systems installed during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. We believe that the combination of higher system prices and lower projected inventory costs as we increase our sales volume and leverage our supplier relationships will enable us to continue to improve our margins.\nService Cost of Revenue. Service cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in service cost of revenue was due to the provisioning of services for the MRIdian system installed at each of Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Los Angeles and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in project material costs and a $0.2 million increase in travel expenses, offset by a $0.2 million decrease in grant project contractor expense due to the expiration of the State of Ohio grant in April 2013.\nSelling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.9 million, or 24%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.3 million increase in travel-related expenses to promote international sales, a $0.2 million increase in trade show expenses, a $0.2 million increase in public relations and website redesign expenses and a $0.1 million increase in marketing consultant expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $5.2 million, or 55%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in accounting and legal fees, a $1.2 million increase in travel expenses, a $1.2 million increase in personnel and related costs as a result of higher employee headcount, and a $1.0 million increase in regulatory consulting expenses. The change was also attributable to a $0.5 million increase in rent and facility expenses due to our new office lease in Mountain View, California, which commenced during the third quarter of 2014.\nInterest Expense\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,243\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (97\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,146\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily due to the long-term debt we incurred in December 2013.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince ViewRay's inception in 2004 as a Florida corporation, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we had net loss of $45.0 million, $33.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had an accumulated deficit of $197.0 million and $152.0 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of ViewRay's common stock, private placements of ViewRay's convertible preferred stock, issuances of convertible promissory notes, issuances of term loans and receipts of customer deposits for new orders and payments from customers for systems installed. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash receipts from sales of MRIdian systems, the net proceeds from the Private Placement and the additional available draw down from the CRG Term Loan, will enable us to conduct our planned operations for at least the next 12 months.\nWe could potentially use our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect, and we may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although we anticipate being able to obtain additional financing through non-dilutive means, we may be unable to do so. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27,469\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,371\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,145\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,593\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nWe have historically experienced negative cash outflows as we developed MRIdian systems and continued to expand our business. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital components as we have grown our business, and is influenced by the timing of cash payments for inventory purchase and cash receipts from our customers. Our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash receipts from customers including sales of MRIdian systems and, to a lesser extent, by up-front payments from customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are amounts due to vendors for purchased components and employee-related expenditures. Our cash flows from operating activities\nwill continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we collect cash receipts from our customers, build up our inventory balances, and increase spending on personnel, and other operating activities as our business grows.\nDuring 2015, operating activities used $39.8 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $45.0 million and $3.7 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $8.8 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred cost of revenue, purchase of inventory, a decrease in accounts payable and making prepaid payments on inventory components, offset by an increase in customer deposits and accrued expenses. The $4.1 million increase in deferred cost of revenue was the result of new MRIdian systems sales orders awaiting installation. This increase also resulted in an increase of $2.4 million in inventory. The $1.1 million increase in deposits on purchased inventory was due to the growth in our business. The decrease of $2.1 million in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The decrease in our operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by $5.3 million increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue, primarily due to new sales contracts, and a $1.5 million increase in accrued expenses attributable to higher accrued inventory purchase. Non-cash charges primarily included $2.9 million for write-off of deferred offering costs, $2.6 million of inventory lower of cost or market charges related to the expected MRIdian system installation in Miami, $1.3 million of depreciation and amortization charges, $1.1 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our debt incurred in December 2013 and June 2015, and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2014, operating activities used $27.5 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $33.8 million, partially offset by a $4.0 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, and aggregate non-cash charges of $2.3 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of higher accounts payable, customer deposits and deferred revenue balances, partially offset by higher deferred costs and accounts receivable balances, increased purchases of inventory, and decreases in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in accounts payable of $4.0 million was due to timing of payments as a result of the growth in our business. The increase in accounts receivable of $0.7 million and the increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue of $10.1 million was primarily due to revenue and new sales order growth in 2014. These changes were offset by a $4.7 million increase in deferred costs and a $3.8 million increase in inventory and deposits on purchased inventory due to installations of MRIdian systems. The decrease of $1.0 million in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was mainly due to a $1.5 million payment of our accrued purchase commitments, offset by a $1.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, higher accrued sales tax and medical device excise tax liabilities, and an increase in accrued interest as a result of debt incurred in December 2013. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.3 million for stock-based compensation, $0.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value and $0.4 million for amortization of debt discount and accrued interest related to our 2014 convertible promissory notes and debt incurred in December 2013.\nDuring 2013, operating activities used $25.4 million in cash, primarily as a result of our net loss of $27.2 million and a $4.3 million net change in our operating assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $6.1 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of increased purchases of inventory and lower accounts payable, offset by increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The increase in inventory of $5.2 million and deposits on purchased components of $0.9 million was mainly due to the installation of MRIdian systems. The decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million was due to timing differences in making payments when compared to December 31, 2012. These changes were offset by a $2.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities attributable to higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount. Non-cash charges primarily included $1.1 million for depreciation and amortization and $4.6 million of LCM adjustments related to the reduction of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during 2015 of $4.1 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities during 2014 of $2.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $2.0 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.6 million.\nWe increased our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2015 to support our growing business operations.\nCash used in investing activities during 2013 of $1.6 million primarily resulted from capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment of $1.2 million and to purchase an intellectual property license of $0.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn June 2015, we entered the CRG Term Loan for up to $50.0 million, of which $30.0 million was made available to us upon closing with the remaining $20.0 million to be available on or before June 26, 2016 upon meeting certain milestones. On March 24, 2016, the CRG Term Loan was amended such that, with regard to the conditions for borrowing the remaining $20.0 million available under the CRG Term Loan, the Company may, at its election, draw down (i) an amount of either $10.0 million or $15.0 million in up to two advances upon achievement of a minimum of $15.0 million aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before March 31, 2016 and (ii) an additional $5.0 million (or $10.0 million, if the previous draw made was only in an amount of $10.0 million) upon achievement of a minimum of $25.0 million of aggregate product and service revenue during any consecutive 12 month period ending on or before December 31, 2016 and upon execution of the first sales contract of our second generation product. On March 21, 2016, we achieved the minimum $15.0 million gross revenue requirement which makes the first $15.0 million of the remaining $20.0 million immediately available for draw down. We drew down the first $30.0 million on the closing date. The Term Loan has a maturity date of June 26, 2020 (i.e., 5 years) and bears cash interest at a rate of 12.50% per annum to be paid quarterly during the first three years, or the interest-payment-only period. The interest-payment-only period can be extended for another year until June 26, 2019 if we complete an initial public offering of our common stock on a nationally recognized securities exchange that raises a minimum of $40.0 million in net cash proceeds with a minimum of $120.0 million post money valuation on or before June 26, 2018. During the interest-payment-only period, we have the option to elect to pay only 8% of the 12.5% per annum interest in cash, and the remaining 4.5% of the 12.5% per annum interest as compounded interest, or deferred payment in-kind interest, added to the aggregate principal amount of the CRG Term Loan. Principal payment and any deferred payment in-kind interest will be paid quarterly in equal installments following the end of the interest-payment-only period through the maturity date.\nThe CRG Term Loan is subject to a prepayment penalty of 3% on the outstanding balance during the first 12 months following the funding of the CRG Term Loan, 2% on the outstanding balance after year 1 but on or before year 2, 1% on the outstanding balance after year 2 but on or before year 3, and 0% on the outstanding loan if prepaid after year 3 thereafter until maturity. The CRG Term Loan is also subject to a facility fee of 7% based on the sum of the CRG Term Loan drawn and any outstanding payment in-kind interest payable on the maturity date or the date such CRG Term Loan becomes due for whatever reason. All direct financing costs were accounted for as a discount on the CRG Term Loan and will be amortized to interest expense during the life of the CRG Term Loan using the effective interest method. The CRG Term Loan is subject to financial covenants and is collateralized by essentially all our assets and limits our ability with respect to additional indebtedness, investments or dividends, among other things, subject to customary exceptions.\nOn June 26, 2015, we paid off in full the $15.0 million outstanding term debt with Hercules using part of the proceeds received from the CRG Term Loan.\nDuring 2015, financing activities provided $53.5 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds of $28.9 million related to the draw-down of long-term debt, net of debt issuance cost, the net proceeds of $26.6 million from the Private Placement and the net proceeds of $15.7 million from issuance of Series C convertible preferred stock, which was partially offset by repayments of a term loan of $15.0 million and payments of $2.7 million for costs related to our originally planned initial public offering.\nDuring 2014, financing activities provided $14.7 million in cash primarily from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible promissory notes of $9.9 million and net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $5.0 million.\nDuring 2013, financing activities provided $49.4 million in cash from the net proceeds related to the issuance of convertible preferred stock of $34.9 million, net of issuance costs, and net proceeds of $14.5 million related to the term loan we entered into with Hercules in December 2013.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the following assumptions and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for systems that we install generally occurs when the customer acknowledges that the system operates in accordance with our standard product specifications, the customer accepts the installed unit and we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer. Service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which contracted services are provided. We use judgment to estimate revenue allocations from sales arrangements with multiple deliverables between the product and service revenue. In situations where a deliverable in a multi-element arrangement has a value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, we are required to allocate the fair value of the various elements based on the selling price of each element. The principal deliverables consist of (i) sales of MRIdian systems, which generally includes installation, site preparation and software, and (ii) product support, which includes extended service and maintenance. We determine selling prices using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if it exists, or third-party evidence, or TPE. If neither VSOE nor TPE exists for a deliverable, we use best estimated selling price, or BESP. We allocate revenue to multiple elements generally using the relative fair values as determined by BESP. We regularly review VSOE, TPE and BESP for all of our products and services.\nWe also receive payments for cost reimbursement of allowable expenditures and payments for the achievement of certain milestones under government grants in return for qualifying property and equity purchases and research and development activities over a contractually defined period. These payments are nonrefundable. Government grants generally provide us with fixed payments and a contractually defined period of research. Grant revenues are recognized as associated expenses incurred and are billed to grantors in conjunction with the terms of the grants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years. At December 31, 2015, total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees, net of estimated forfeitures, was $5.2 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCommon Stock Warrant\nIn December 2013 in connection with the Hercules Term Loan, we issued a warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our preferred stock with an exercise price of $5.84 per share, subject to certain adjustments. These warrants were converted to warrant to purchase our common stock upon the closing of the Merger in July 2015. This warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrant, which is the later of (i) December 16, 2023 and (ii) the date that is five years following the effective date of the registration statement of an initial underwritten public offering of our common stock.\nPrior to the Merger, the preferred stock warrant is recorded as preferred stock warrant liability and adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date, with the change in fair value being recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon the closing of the Merger on July 23, 2015, all shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock, and the warrant to purchase Series C convertible preferred stock was converted into the warrant to purchase 128,231 shares of our common stock. Fair value of these warrants at the closing date were reclassified into additional paid-in capital, and we no longer recorded change in fair value adjustment to the converted common stock warrants.\nIn connection with the Merger and the Private Placement, in July and August 2015, we issued 198,760 shares of common stock warrants at an exercise price of $5.00 per share to private placement agents as payment for services provided. These placement\nwarrants are exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until the five year anniversary of its date of issuance. These warrants were accounted for as equity awards.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists primarily of purchased components for assembling MRIdian systems and other direct costs associated with MRIdian system installation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. When the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than related costs, we reduce the carrying value of the inventory for the difference while recording a corresponding charge to cost of product revenues. The assumptions we used in estimating the net realizable value of the inventory primarily include the total cost to complete the applicable MRIdian system. We recorded an inventory lower of cost and market adjustment of $2.6 million, $0.6 million and $4.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, our inventory cost was measured on a first-in, first-out basis through specific identification. To support the increasing MRIdian system installations and inventory purchase activities, starting January 1, 2015, we elected to change inventory cost measurement to weighted average basis. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on prior periods' financial statements, therefore no retrospective adjustment is required. The accounting principle change does not have an impact on product cost of revenue or net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we calculate deferred tax asset or liability account balances at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect our taxable income.\nWe estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differences in accounting for reporting purposes and tax purposes for certain items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or when net operating loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credit carryforwards can be utilized.\nWe assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we have a full valuation allowance set up for our net deferred tax assets.\nUnder federal and similar state tax statutes, changes in our ownership, including ownership changes resulting from the Merger, may limit our ability to use our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The annual limitation, as a result of a change of ownership, may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. We believe we have experienced at least one ownership change in the past. We are currently analyzing the tax impact of such ownership change on our federal NOLs and credit carryforwards. Our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience an ownership change or as a result of future changes in our stock ownership.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each such standard will"}
