Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nWe are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol GEL.\u201d We are (i) a provider of an integrated suite of midstream services - primarily transportation, storage, sulfur removal, blending, terminalling and processing-for a large area of the Gulf Coast region of the crude oil and natural gas industry and (ii) one of the leading producers in the world of natural soda ash. Our sulfur removal business results in us being the largest producer, we believe, in the world of sodium hydrosulfide (or NaHS, pronounced nash\u201d).\nHistorically, a substantial majority of our focus has been on the midstream segment of the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. We provide an integrated suite of services to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises and have a diverse portfolio of assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. Our Alkali Business mines and processes trona from which it produces natural soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), a basic building block for a number of ubiquitous products, including flat glass, container glass, dry detergent and a variety of chemicals and other industrial products. Our Alkali Business has a diverse customer base in the United States, Canada, the European Community, the European Free Trade Area and the South African Customs Union with many long-term relationships. It has been operating for almost 70 years and has an estimated remaining reserve life (based on 2018 production) of over 100 years.\nWithin our legacy midstream business, we have two distinct, complementary types of operations-(i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners, which includes our sulfur removal, transportation, storage, and other handling services. Our onshore-based operations occur upstream of, at, and downstream of refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we aggregate, purchase, gather and transport crude oil, which we sell to refiners. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in sulfur removal/balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for finished refined petroleum products and certain refining by-products. In our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, we provide services to one of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S.-the Gulf of Mexico, a producing region representing approximately 16% of the crude oil production in the U.S. in 2018. Our legacy midstream business has a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nIncluded in Management's Discussion and Analysis are the following sections:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overview of 2018 Results\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other Consolidated Results\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial Measures\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview of 2018 Results\nWe reported Net Loss Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $6.1 million, or $0.62 per common unit, in 2018 compared to Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $82.6 million, or $0.50 per common unit, in 2017. The decrease was principally due to impairment expense of $126.3 million recognized during 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in depreciation and interest expense during 2018 of $60.7 million and $52.4 million, respectively, primarily attributable to owning our Alkali assets for a full year and the interest on the debt associated with that acquisition.\nThese decreases to net income were offset by an increase in our reported Segment Margin (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") of $118.2 million principally due to twelve months of contribution from our Alkali Business during 2018 relative to four months during 2017 and the increase in volumes in our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily in Louisiana. Additionally, we recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $8.4 million associated with the valuation of our embedded derivative on our Class A Convertible Preferred Units recognized during 2018 compared to an unrealized loss reported in 2017 of approximately $10.5 million (both of which are recorded in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations).\nCash flow from operating activities was $390.0 million for the 2018 period compared to $323.6 million for 2017, primarily driven by an increase in Segment Margin of $118.2 million during 2018 relative to 2017, partially offset by an increase in working capital effects of $12.3 million during 2018 relative to 2017.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") increased $77.1 million in 2018 to $466.1 million as compared to 2017 Available Cash before Reserves of $389.0 million. See \"Financial Measures\" below for additional information on Available Cash before Reserves.\nSegment Margin was $712.8 million in 2018, an increase of $118.2 million, or 20%, as compared to 2017. This increase resulted primarily from higher contributions from our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment (principally due to owning our Alkali Business for a full year in 2018 as compared to four months during 2017) and our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily attributable to our increased volumes during 2018 from our recently constructed assets in Louisiana and Texas, partially offset by smaller decreases in our other segments.\nIn 2018, we continued our path to de-leveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our financial flexibility to continue building long term value to stakeholders. We continued to find opportunities to right size our businesses and, during 2018, divested certain of our non-core assets to accelerate our goal to de-leverage our balance sheet. These steps, along with stable cash flows from our recently completed acquisition of our Alkali Business and the contribution from our recent strategic investments, we believe further enhance our financial flexibility to opportunistically pursue accretive organic projects and acquisitions should they present themselves. Additionally, we have situated ourselves well for future increases in volumes in our offshore business due to the long-lived reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that requires little or no additional investment from us. Overall, we believe these actions to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility are the best actions we can take to allow us to generate strong optimal returns for our unitholders in the years ahead.\nWe currently manage our businesses through four divisions that constitute our reportable segments - offshore pipeline transportation, sodium minerals and sulfur services, onshore facilities and transportation and marine transportation.\nA more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs is included below in \"Results of Operations\".\nDistributions to Unitholders\nOn February 14, 2019, we paid a distribution of $0.55 per unit related to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWith respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we have declared a payment-in-kind or PIK of the quarterly distribution, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 534,576 Class A Convertible Preferred Units. This PIK amount equates to a distribution of $0.7374 per Class A Convertible Preferred Unit for the 2018 Quarter, or $2.9496 annualized. These distributions were paid on February 14, 2019 to unitholders holders of record at the close of business January 31, 2019.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives\nAlkali Business Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. During 2018, we continued to integrate the Alkali business and the results of the business have exceeded our expectations to date.\nBaton Rouge Area Infrastructure Expansion\nWe expanded our existing Baton Rouge area infrastructure to allow for greater capacity and flexibility in servicing our major refinery customer in the region. This expansion included the construction of an additional 500,000 barrels of crude oil tankage at our existing Baton Rouge Terminal. Additionally, this expansion included the upgrading of pumping and other infrastructure capabilities in order to allow for the efficient handling of expected increases in crude oil volumes received at our Baton Rouge area facilities. These assets became operational in the first half of 2018.\nPowder River Basin Midstream Assets Divestiture\nOn October 11, 2018, we completed the divestiture of our Powder River Basin midstream assets and received total net proceeds of approximately $300 million that we utilized to reduce the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nResults of Operations\nIn the discussions that follow, we will focus on our revenues, expenses and net income, as well as two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations-Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves are defined in the \"Financial Measures\" section below.\nRevenues, Costs and Expenses\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $884.4 million, or 44%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, our costs and expenses (excluding gains on sale of assets and impairment expense) increased $810.4 million, or 45%, between the two periods. These increases are primarily attributable to the effects of a full year of results from our Alkali Business during 2018, along with the increase in crude oil prices during 2018 that proportionately impacted our revenues and cost of sales.\nThe addition of our Alkali Business resulted in a large increase in revenues and costs relative to 2017 (which are reflected in our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment). Those increases are principally derived from mining trona ore and processing the entrained mineral sodium carbonate, also known as naturally occurring soda ash. Natural soda ash has significant cost advantages over synthetically produced soda ash, which we believe will exist for the foreseeable future. Natural soda ash accounts for only about 25% of the world's production; thus, we believe we should be able to somewhat mitigate the effects of market-specific factors (e.g., changes in sales prices for our products, our operating costs, and other economic considerations) on Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves, and Segment Margin in the soda ash market in which we operate.\nIn addition to our Alkali Business, we continue to operate in our other legacy businesses, including: (i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties; and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners. Refiners are the shippers of approximately 80% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contract for over 80% of the use of our inland barges, which are used primarily to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Their large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in relatively low commodity price environments. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in commodity prices to impact our Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin derived from our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations in the same manner in which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\nA substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products through our onshore facilities and transportation segment. In addition, our revenues and costs between these two periods have been impacted by increases in market prices associated with our crude oil and petroleum product sales as discussed further below. In general, we do not expect fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas to materially affect our net income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin to the same extent they affect our revenues and costs. We have limited our direct commodity price exposure in our crude oil and petroleum products operations through the broad use of fee-based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements, and hedges. As a result, changes in the price of crude oil\nwould proportionately impact both our revenues and our costs, with a disproportionately smaller net impact on our Segment Margin.\nAs discussed throughout this document, we have some indirect exposure to certain changes in prices for oil and petroleum products, particularly if they are significant and extended. We tend to experience more demand for certain of our services when prices increase significantly over extended periods of time, and we tend to experience less demand for certain of our services when prices decrease significantly over extended periods of time. For additional information regarding certain of our indirect exposure to commodity prices, see our segment-by-segment analysis below and the previous section entitled Risks Related to Our Business\u201d.\nPrices of crude oil have increased since December 31, 2017. The average closing prices for West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") increased 27% to $64.74 per barrel on a year to date average for 2018, as compared to $50.95 per barrel for 2017. We would expect changes in crude oil prices to continue to proportionately affect our revenues and costs attributable to our purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products, producing minimal direct impact on Segment Margin from those operations. However, due to the indirect exposure to changes in prices discussed above and in the discussion surrounding our onshore facilities and transportation segment, crude oil and petroleum product sales volumes decreased 11% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAdditionally, changes in certain of our operating costs between the respective periods, including those associated with our offshore pipeline and marine transportation segments, are not directly correlated with commodity prices. We discuss certain of those costs in further detail below in our segment-by-segment analysis.\nIncluded below is additional detailed discussion of the results of our operations focusing on Segment Margin and other costs including general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes.\nSegment Margin\nThe contribution of each of our segments to total Segment Margin in each of the last three years was as follows:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2017, primarily due to lower volumes. During 2018, we experienced a greater amount of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at several of the production facilities connected to our offshore infrastructure. Additionally, during 2018, three particular major fields underperformed our expectations. Offsetting this in future years are two subsea tie-backs to the same dedicated in-field production facility scheduled to come on-line during the second half of 2019, which requires minimal to no additional capital investment from the partnership. We believe that one of the fields is underperforming as a result of reservoir quality degradation, and not due to mechanical factors. We believe that the other two large underperforming fields are predominately underperforming as the result of slower production rates than those that were communicated to us last year due to the operator's\nreserve recovery maximization efforts. Notwithstanding these short term negatives, we are currently seeing increasing demand for our assets from production that is currently dedicated to 3rd party pipelines but is unable to get to shore due to a lack of capacity on such pipelines. Given our excess capacity and connectivity on certain of our systems, we expect to benefit from this takeaway capacity constraint in future periods.\nIn addition, the minimum bill reservation fees we collect on one of our offshore oil pipelines had a prior year step down, and we collected approximately $4.4 million less in segment margin in 2018 relative to 2017. Lastly, 2017 included contributions of approximately $2.0 million from certain of our previously owned gas pipeline and platform assets that were divested during the second quarter of 2017.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes sold :\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS volumes (Dry short tons \"DST\")\n</td> <td>150,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Soda Ash volumes (short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>3,669,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,274,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) volumes (dry short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>110,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>3,929,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS revenues, excluding non-cash revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) revenues\n</td> <td>61,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues associated with Alkali Business\n</td> <td>829,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>7,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total external segment revenues, excluding non-cash revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,078,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium minerals and sulfur services operating costs, excluding non-cash items\n</td> <td>(818,290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(340,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average index price for NaOH per DST (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Source: IHS Chemical\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2018 increased $130.2 million, or 100%, from 2017. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business for twelve months during 2018 compared to four months during 2017, beginning with the acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2019. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation). Additionally, our refinery services business continues to perform well with increased NaHS volumes of approximately 13% during 2018 as they benefited from increased demand from certain of our international mining customers, primarily located in South America and our domestic mining and pulp and paper customers.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOur onshore facilities and transportation segment utilizes an integrated set of pipelines and terminals, as well as trucks, railcars, and barges to facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products on behalf of producers, refiners and other customers. This segment includes crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminals, rail facilities and CO2 pipelines operating\nprimarily within the United States Gulf Coast crude oil market. In addition, we utilize our railcar and trucking fleets that support the purchase and sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil, as well as purchased and sold refined products. Through these assets we offer our customers a full suite of services, including the following:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>facilitating the transportation of crude oil from producers to refineries and from owned and third party terminals to refiners via pipelines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transporting CO2 from natural and anthropogenic sources to crude oil fields owned by our customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>shipping crude oil and refined products to and from producers and refiners via trucks, railcars and pipelines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>loading and unloading railcars at our crude-by-rail terminals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>storing and blending of crude oil and intermediate and finished refined products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending those products to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We also may use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions for crude oil gathering and marketing and to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products.\nDespite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity, sulfur content and metals content. The refineries evaluate the costs to obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help the refineries in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources and transport crude oil meeting their requirements. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting the refiners' requirements may also provide opportunities for us to utilize our purchasing and logistical skills to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our crude oil purchase contracts contains a market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transportation and to provide us with a margin. Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the chemical composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials.\nIn our refined products marketing operations, we supply primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products to wholesale markets and some end-users such as paper mills and utilities. We also provide a service to refineries by purchasing heavier\u201d petroleum products that are the residual fuels from gasoline production, transporting them to one of our terminals and blending them to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers.\nOperating results for our onshore facilities and transportation segment were as follows: Table 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering, marketing, and logistics revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,154,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>971,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and CO2 pipeline tariffs and revenues from direct financing leases of CO2 pipelines\n</td> <td>74,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments received under direct financing leases not included in income\n</td> <td>7,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and products costs, excluding unrealized gains and losses from derivative transactions\n</td> <td>(1,038,386\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(866,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs, excluding non-cash charges for long-term incentive compensation and other non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>(88,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>10,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric Data (average barrels/day unless otherwise noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas\n</td> <td>33,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jay\n</td> <td>14,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mississippi\n</td> <td>6,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Louisiana (1)\n</td> <td>159,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wyoming (2)\n</td> <td>33,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines total\n</td> <td>247,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CO2 pipeline (average Mcf/day):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free State\n</td> <td>107,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and petroleum products sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total crude oil and petroleum products sales\n</td> <td>45,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail unload volumes (3)\n</td> <td>89,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total daily volume for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 includes 55,202 and 56,748 barrels per day respectively of intermediate refined products associated with our Port of Baton Rouge Terminal pipelines which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The volumes presented for 2018 represent the average barrels/day through September 30, 2018, as the relevant assets were divested in October 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Includes total barrels for unloading at all rail facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Segment Margin for our onshore facilities and transportation segment increased $23.5 million, or 24% , in 2018 as compared to 2017. The 2018 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was slightly offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. Additionally, while volumes were relatively constant on our Texas system between 2018 and 2017, we were able to recognize a full 12 months of minimum volume commitments in segment margin during 2018 compared to 7 months during 2017, as the expansion and re-purposing of our system was completed during the second quarter of 2017.\nMarine Transportation Segment\nWithin our marine transportation segment, we own a fleet of 91 barges (82 inland and 9 offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of 3.2 million barrels, 42 push/tow boats (33 inland and 9 offshore), and a 330,000 barrel ocean going tanker, the M/T American Phoenix.

The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily attributable to our offshore barge fleet entering into short term spot price contracts, which can lead to a less favorable rebill structure and higher operating costs, as our last legacy term contract rolled off during the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in operating costs during 2018 relative to 2017 due to the increase in our dry-docking costs. We have continued to enter into short term contracts (less than a year) in both the inland and offshore markets because we believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows. While we are reasonably hopeful that we've reached a bottom for the quarterly segment margin from our entire fleet of assets, we have no expectation of the fundamentals for marine transportation showing any significant improvement through at least the next several years. This excludes the M/T American Phoenix which is under long term contract through September 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increased segment margin in the 2018 period related to the M/T American Phoenix. During 2017, the M/T American Phoenix underwent its planned regulatory dry-docking inspections which negatively impacted segment margin. Additionally, the 2018 period also had higher utilization on our inland barge operation.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses not separately identified below:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment\n</td> <td>4,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive based compensation plan expense\n</td> <td>2,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party costs related to business development activities and growth projects\n</td> <td>9,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million between 2018 and 2017.

The 2017 period also reflects the effects of a contractual adjustment to a lower rate for a lateral we own that will be in place going forward. In addition, we benefited in 2016 from the temporary diversion of certain natural gas volumes from third party gas pipelines to one of our gas pipelines and related facilities due to one-time disruptions at onshore processing facilities where such volumes typically flow.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes sold:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS volumes (Dry short tons \"DST\")\n</td> <td>133,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Soda Ash volumes (short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>1,274,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) volumes (dry short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>84,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,492,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) revenues\n</td> <td>42,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues associated with Alkali Business\n</td> <td>273,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>5,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total external segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium minerals and sulfur services operating costs, excluding non-cash items\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(340,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(101,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average index price for NaOH per DST (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Source: IHS Chemical\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2017 increased $50.8 million, or 64%, from 2016. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business since our acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2018 as we continue to remain the global leader in natural soda ash production. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation).\nThese contributions were partially offset by the results of our sulfur removal business and related NaHS and caustic soda activities. Our 2017 results for these activities were in line with our expectations and include the effects of previously disclosed commercial discussions with certain of our host refineries and several NaHS customers, which resulted in extending the term and tenor of a large number of contractual relationships.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our onshore facilities and transportation segment were as follows: Table 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering, marketing, and logistics revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>971,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and CO2 tariffs and revenues from direct financing leases of CO2 pipelines\n</td> <td>67,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments received under direct financing leases not included in income\n</td> <td>6,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and products costs, excluding unrealized gains and losses from derivative transactions\n</td> <td>(866,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(823,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs, excluding non-cash charges for equity-based compensation and other non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>(87,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric Data (average barrels/day unless otherwise noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas\n</td> <td>32,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jay\n</td> <td>14,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mississippi\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Louisiana (1)\n</td> <td>135,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wyoming\n</td> <td>22,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines total\n</td> <td>212,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CO2 pipeline (average Mcf/day):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free State\n</td> <td>77,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and petroleum products sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total crude oil and petroleum products sales\n</td> <td>51,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail load/unload volumes (2)\n</td> <td>52,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total daily volume for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes 56,748 and 8,997 barrels per day respectively of intermediate refined products associated with our Port of Baton Rouge Terminal pipelines which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The 2017 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was principally offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. In addition, the 2017 period was negatively impacted by lower volumes on our Texas pipeline system, as the repurposing of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and expansion of our terminal infrastructure did not became operational until the second quarter of 2017 (while a large portion of 2016 included historical volumes on our legacy Texas pipeline system assets prior to the repurposing project).\nMarine Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our marine transportation segment were as follows:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland freight revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore freight revenues\n</td> <td>73,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other rebill revenues (1)\n</td> <td>49,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs, excluding non-cash charges for equity-based compensation and other non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet Utilization: (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Utilization\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore Barge Utilization\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Under certain of our marine contracts, we \"rebill\" our customers for a portion of our operating costs.\n(2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and drydocking.\nMarine Transportation Segment Margin for 2017 decreased $19.8 million, or 28% from 2016. The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily due to lower day rates on our inland and offshore fleets (which offset higher utilization as adjusted for planned dry docking time in our offshore fleet). The M/T American Phoenix also underwent planned regulatory dry docking inspections for approximately one month during 2017, which negatively impacted Segment Margin. In our inland fleet, weaker demand continued to apply pressure on our rates, which we expect to continue into 2018. In our offshore barge fleet, as a number of our units have come off longer term contracts, we have continued to choose to primarily place them in spot service or short-term (less than a year) service because we continue to believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses not separately identified below:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation plan expense\n</td> <td>(2,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party costs related to business development activities and growth projects\n</td> <td>13,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $21 million between 2017 and 2016.

Those amounts are included in onshore facilities and transportation product costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are not a component of Segment Margin. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $40.3 million of gains resulting from the sale of certain non-core assets, as well as a $12.6 million non-cash provision relating to certain leased railcars no longer in use.\nFinancial Measures\nOverview\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the financial measure of Available Cash before Reserves, which is a non-GAAP\u201d measure because it is not contemplated by or referenced in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). We also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the relevant data points considered from time to time.\nWhen evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance, liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of\ndirectors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.\nSegment Margin\nWe define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses, and segment general and administrative expenses, after eliminating gain or loss on sale of assets, plus or minus applicable Select Items. Although, we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment.\nA reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves\nPurposes, Uses and Definition\nAvailable Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>the financial performance of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>our operating performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We define Available Cash before Reserves ( Available Cash before Reserves\u201d) as net income(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, Select Items\u201d), as adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, net interest expense and cash tax expense.

We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.\nMaintenance Capital Requirements\nMAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.\nPrior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.\nBeginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.\nIn summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management's increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves.\nMAINTENANCE CAPITAL UTILIZED\nWe believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components.\nOur maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. Because we did not use our maintenance capital utilized measure before 2014, our maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion\n</td> <td>317,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>126,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (minus) Select Items, net\n</td> <td>47,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital utilized\n</td> <td>(19,955\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash tax expense\n</td> <td>(835\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Cash before Reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>466,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2018, we believe our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong, including $728.7 million of borrowing capacity available under our $1.7 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. We anticipate that our future internally-generated funds and the funds available under our credit facility will allow us to meet our ordinary course capital needs. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our credit facility and the proceeds from issuances of equity and senior unsecured notes.\nOur primary cash requirements consist of:\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>working capital, primarily inventories and trade receivables and payables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>routine operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital growth and maintenance projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisitions of assets or businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest payments related to outstanding debt; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Resources\nOur ability to satisfy future capital needs will depend on our ability to raise substantial amounts of additional capital from time to time - including through equity and debt offerings (public and private), borrowings under our credit facility and other financing transactions-and to implement our growth strategy successfully. No assurance can be made that we will be able to raise necessary funds on satisfactory terms.\nOn October 11, 2018, we completed the sale of our Powder River Basin midstream assets, for which we received total net proceeds of approximately $300 million. We applied those net proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $970.1 million borrowed under our credit facility, with $17.8 million of the borrowed amount designated as a loan under the inventory sublimit. Due to the revolving nature of loans under our credit facility, additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re-borrowings may be made until the maturity date of May 9, 2022. Our credit facility does not include a borrowing base\u201d limitation except with respect to our inventory loans.\nThe total amount available for borrowings under our credit facility at December 31, 2018 was $728.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, our long-term debt totaled $3.4 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion outstanding under our credit facility (including $17.8 million borrowed under the inventory sublimit tranche), $450 million of our 2026 Notes, $550 million of our 2025 Notes, $350 million of our 2024 Notes, $400 million of our 2023 Notes and $750 million of our 2022 Notes.\nWe have the right to redeem each of our series of notes beginning on specified dates as summarized below, at a premium to the face amount of such notes that varies based on the time remaining to maturity on such notes. Additionally, we may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of each of our series of notes with the proceeds from an equity offering of our common units during certain periods. A summary of the applicable redemption periods is provided in the table below.\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2022 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2025 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2026 Notes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption right beginning on\n</td> <td>August 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 1, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of up to 35% of the principal amount of notes with the proceeds of an equity offering permitted prior to\n</td> <td>August 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 1, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information on our long-term debt and covenants see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nClass A Convertible Preferred Units\nOn September 1, 2017, we sold $750 million of Class A convertible preferred units in a private placement, comprised of 22,249,494 units for a cash purchase price per unit of $33.71 (subject to certain adjustments, the Issue Price\u201d) to two initial purchasers. Our general partner executed an amendment to our partnership agreement in connection therewith, which, among\nother things, authorized and established the rights and preferences of our preferred units. Our preferred units are a new class of security that ranks senior to all of our currently outstanding classes or series of limited partner interests with respect to distribution and/or liquidation rights. Holders of our preferred units vote on an as-converted basis with holders of our common units and have certain class voting rights, including with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect the rights, preferences or privileges, or otherwise modify the terms, of those preferred units.\nEach of our preferred units accumulate quarterly distribution amounts in arrears at an annual rate of 8.75% (or $2.9496), yielding a quarterly rate of 2.1875% (or $0.7374), subject to certain adjustments. With respect to any quarter ending on or prior to March 1, 2019, we have the option to pay to the holders of our preferred units the applicable distribution amount in cash, preferred units, or any combination thereof. If we elect to pay all or any portion of a quarterly distribution amount in preferred units, the number of such preferred units will equal the product of (i) the number of then outstanding preferred units and (ii) the quarterly rate. We have elected to pay all distribution amounts attributable to 2017 and 2018 in preferred units. For each period ending after March 1, 2019, we must pay all distribution amounts in respect of our preferred units in cash.\nSee Note 12 for additional information regarding our preferred units.\nEquity Distribution Program and Shelf Registration Statements\nWe expect to issue additional equity and debt securities in the future to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, particularly those related to opportunistically acquiring assets and businesses and constructing new facilities and refinancing outstanding debt.\nIn 2016, we implemented an equity distribution program that will allow us to consummate at the market\u201d offerings of common units from time to time through brokered transactions, which should help mitigate certain adverse consequences of underwritten offerings, including the downward pressure on the market price of our common units and the expensive fees and other costs associated with such public offerings. We entered into an equity distribution agreement with a group of banks who will act as sales agents or principals for up to $400.0 million of our common units, if and when we should elect to issue additional common units from time to time, although there are limits to the amount of our at the market\u201d offerings the market can absorb from time to time. In connection with implementing our equity distribution program, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (our \"EDP Shelf\") with the SEC. Our EDP Shelf allows us to issue up to $1.0 billion of equity and debt securities, whether pursuant to our equity distribution program or otherwise. Our EDP Shelf will expire in October 2020. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued no units under this program.\nWe have another universal shelf registration statement (our \"2018 Shelf\") on file with the SEC. Our 2018 Shelf allows us to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities in connection with certain types of public offerings. However, the receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of equity and/or debt securities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, our long-term business prospects and other factors beyond our control, including market conditions. Our 2018 Shelf will expire in April 2021. We expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement before our 2018 Shelf expires.\nCash Flows from Operations\nWe generally utilize the cash flows we generate from our operations to fund our distributions and working capital needs. Excess funds that are generated are used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and/or to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by changes in items of working capital, primarily variances in the carrying amount of inventory and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures.\nWe typically sell our crude oil in the same month in which we purchase it, so we do not need to rely on borrowings under our credit facility to pay for such crude oil purchases, other than inventory. During such periods, our accounts receivable and accounts payable generally move in tandem as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale of crude oil.\nIn our petroleum products activities, we buy products and typically either move those products to one of our storage facilities for further blending or sell those products within days of our purchase. The cash requirements for these activities can result in short term increases and decreases in our borrowings under our credit facility.\nIn our Alkali Business, we typically extract trona from our mining facilities, process into soda ash and other alkali products, and deliver and sell to our customers all within a relatively short time frame. If we did experience any differences in timing of extraction, processing and sales of this trona or Alkali products, this could impact the cash requirements for these activities in the short term.\nThe storage of our inventory of crude oil, petroleum products and alkali products can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities. In the month we pay for the stored crude oil or petroleum products (or pay for extraction and processing activities in the case of alkali products), we borrow under our credit facility (or use cash on hand) to pay for the\ncrude oil or petroleum products (or extraction/processing of alkali products), utilizing a portion of our operating cash flows. Conversely, cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil, petroleum products or alkali products. Additionally, we may be required to deposit margin funds with the NYMEX when commodity prices increase as the value of the derivatives utilized to hedge the price risk in our inventory fluctuates. These deposits also impact our operating cash flows as we borrow under our credit facility or use cash on hand to fund the deposits.\nNet cash flows provided by our operating activities were $390.0 million and $323.6 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. As discussed above, changes in the cash requirements related to payment for petroleum products or collection of receivables from the sale of inventory impact the cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, changes in the market prices for crude oil, petroleum products and alkali products can result in fluctuations in our working capital and, therefore, our operating cash flows between periods as the cost to acquire a barrel of crude oil or petroleum products (or the cost to extract/process in the case alkali products) will require more or less cash. The increase in operating cash flow for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due an increase in segment margin of $118.2 million partially offset by an increase in working capital of $12.3 million.\nNet cash flows provided by our operating activities were $323.6 million and $282.8 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in operating cash flow for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in working capital.\nCapital Expenditures and Distributions Paid to Our Unitholders\nWe use cash primarily for our operating expenses, working capital needs, debt service, acquisition activities, internal growth projects and distributions we pay to our unitholders. We finance maintenance capital expenditures and smaller internal growth projects and distributions primarily with cash generated by our operations. We have historically funded material growth capital projects (including acquisitions and internal growth projects) with borrowings under our credit facility, equity issuances and/or the issuance of senior unsecured notes.\nCapital Expenditures and Business and Asset Acquisitions\nThe following table summarizes our expenditures for fixed assets, business and other asset acquisitions in the periods indicated:\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for fixed and intangible assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore pipeline transportation assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium mineral and sulfur services assets\n</td> <td>55,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marine transportation assets\n</td> <td>18,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore facilities and transportation assets\n</td> <td>3,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology systems\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>81,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore pipeline transportation assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium minerals and sulfur services assets\n</td> <td>19,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marine transportation assets\n</td> <td>12,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore facilities and transportation assets\n</td> <td>47,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology systems\n</td> <td>2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total growth capital expenditures\n</td> <td>82,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures for fixed and intangible assets\n</td> <td>164,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures for business combinations, net of liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of Alkali Business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of remaining interest in equity investment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total business combinations capital expenditures\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures related to equity investees\n</td> <td>3,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,581,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpenditures for capital assets to grow the partnership distribution will depend on our access to debt and equity capital. We will look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows. We continue to pursue a long term growth strategy that may require significant capital.\nGrowth Capital Expenditures\nAll of our previously announced growth capital projects were placed in service prior to December 31, 2018. We are currently not anticipating growth capital expenditures during 2019 to exceed $50 million.\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures\nMaintenance capital expenditures increased during 2018 primarily due to the maintenance capital expenditures incurred related to our Alkali Business given the nature of its operations. We also incur maintenance capital expenditures in our marine transportation segment due to the costs to replace and upgrade certain equipment associated with our vessels. We expect future expenditures to be within a reasonable range of 2018's expenditures dependent upon the timing of when we incur certain costs. See previous discussion under \"Available Cash before Reserves\" for how such maintenance capital utilization is reflected in our calculation of Available Cash before Reserves.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nOur partnership agreement requires us to distribute 100% of our available cash (as defined therein) within 45 days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record.

With respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we have declared a payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") of the quarterly distribution, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 534,576 Class A Convertible Preferred Units. This PIK amount equates to a distribution of $0.7374 per Class A Convertible Preferred Unit for the 2018 Quarter, or $2.9496 annualized.

We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes. Significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 (see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d).\nWe have defined critical accounting policies and estimates as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial results and positions. These policies require management's judgment and often employ the use of information that is\ninherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies pertain to measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities in business acquisitions, depreciation, amortization and impairment of long-lived assets, deferred maintenance on marine fixed assets, equity plan compensation accruals and contingent and environmental liabilities. We discuss these policies below.\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities Acquired and Identification of Associated Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn conjunction with each acquisition we make, we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As additional information becomes available, we may adjust the original estimates within a short time period subsequent to the acquisition. In addition, we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as customer relationships, contracts, trade names and non-compete agreements involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management's assessment of the value of the assets acquired, and to the extent available, third party assessments. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life as determined by management. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment. Uncertainties associated with these estimates include fluctuations in economic obsolescence factors in the area and potential future sources of cash flow. We cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 regarding further discussion regarding our acquisitions.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nIn order to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization we must estimate the useful lives of our fixed assets (including the reserve life of our mineral leaseholds) at the time the assets are placed in service. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method based on these estimated useful lives. The actual period over which we will use the asset may differ from the assumptions we have made about the estimated useful life. We adjust the remaining useful life as we become aware of such circumstances.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are required to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. If an intangible asset has a finite useful life, but the precise length of that life is not known, that intangible asset shall be amortized over the best estimate of its useful life. At a minimum, we will assess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets on an annual basis to determine if adjustments are required. We are recording amortization of our customer and supplier relationships, licensing agreements, trade names, non-compete agreements, and other contract intangibles based on the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Generally, the contribution of these assets to our cash flows is expected to decline over time, such that greater value is attributable to the periods shortly after the acquisition was made. Our favorable lease and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.\nWe compute depletion using the units of production method using actual production and our estimated reserve life. The actual reserve life may differ from the assumptions we have made about the estimated reserve life.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets including Intangibles and Goodwill\nWhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a fixed asset or intangible asset with finite lives may not be recoverable, we review our assets for impairment. We compare the carrying value of the fixed asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from that asset. Estimates of future net cash flows include estimating future volumes, future margins or tariff rates, future operating costs and other estimates and assumptions consistent with our business plans. If we determine that an asset's unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment; we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset. During 2018, we recognized impairment expense of $103.2 million associated with long-lived assets (refer to Note 7 for additional details).\nAny such write-down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life of an intangible asset would increase costs and expenses at that time. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase prices we paid for certain businesses over their respective fair values. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we evaluate, and test if necessary, our goodwill (at the reporting unit level) for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year, and more frequently, if indicators of impairment are present.\nWe may perform a qualitative assessment of relevant events and circumstances about the likelihood of goodwill impairment. If it is deemed more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. Otherwise, further testing is not required. We may also elect to exercise our unconditional option to bypass this qualitative assessment, in which case we would also calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. The qualitative assessment is based on reviewing the totality of several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity specific events (for example, changes in management) or other events such as selling or disposing of a reporting unit. The determination of a reporting unit's fair value is predicated on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit. Such assumptions include\n(i) discrete financial forecasts for the assets contained within the reporting unit, which rely on management's estimates of operating margins, (ii) long-term growth rates for cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period, (iii) appropriate discount rates and (iv) estimates of the cash flow multiples to apply in estimating the market value of our reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit (including its inherent goodwill) is less than its carrying value, a charge to earnings may be required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. If future results are not consistent with our estimates, we could be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. We monitor the markets for our products and services, in addition to the overall market, to determine if a triggering event occurs that would indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nWe performed a quantitative assessment as of October 1, 2018, for both our refinery services and supply and logistics reporting units that have goodwill. No impairment was recorded in our refinery services segment during 2018 as the fair value far exceeded the carrying value. Our supply and logistics reporting unit, which primarily includes our legacy crude oil and refined products marketing and trucking businesses, was determined to have a fair value lower than its carrying value and the partnership recorded an impairment charge of $23.1 million during 2018 (Note 10).\nOne of our other monitoring procedures is the comparison of our market capitalization to our book equity on a quarterly basis to determine if there is an indicator of impairment. As of December 31, 2018, our market capitalization exceeded the book value of our equity (partner's capital) and there were no other indicators of impairment identified.\nFor additional information regarding our goodwill, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nEquity Compensation Plan Accrual\nOur 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for grantees, which may include key employees and directors, to receive cash at the vesting of the phantom units equal to the average of the closing market price of our common units for the twenty trading days prior to the vesting date. Our phantom units under this plan are comprised of both service-based and performance-based awards. Until the vesting date, we calculate estimates of the fair value of the awards and record that value as compensation expense during the vesting period on a straight-line basis. These estimates are based on the current trading price of our common units and an estimate of the forfeiture rate we expect may occur. For our performance-based awards, our fair value estimates are weighted based on probabilities for each performance condition applicable to the award. At December 31, 2018, we had 573,945 phantom units outstanding and recorded expense of $2.1 million during 2018. The liability recorded for phantom units expected to vest fluctuates with the market price of our common units. At the date of vesting, any difference between the estimates recorded and the actual cash paid to the grantee will be charged to expense. At December 31, 2018, we estimated approximately $0.6 million of remaining compensation costs to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 9 months. Changes in our assumptions may impact our liabilities and expenses related to these awards.\nSee Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our equity compensation plans.\nFair Value of Derivatives\nThe fair value of a derivative at a particular period end does not reflect the end results of a particular transaction, and will most likely not reflect the gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. We reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties. We have commodity and other derivatives that are accounted for as assets and liabilities at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuations of our derivatives that are exchange traded are based on market prices on the applicable exchange on the last day of the period. For our derivatives that are not exchange traded, the estimates we use are based on indicative broker quotations or an internal valuation model. Our valuation models utilize market observable inputs such as price, volatility, correlation and other factors and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market.\nWe also have embedded derivatives in our Class A Convertible preferred units that are accounted for as liabilities at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018. Derivatives related to the embedded derivatives in our preferred units are valued using a model that contains inputs, including our common unit price, 30-year U.S. Treasury rates, default probabilities and timing estimates, which involve management judgment.\nLiability and Contingency Accruals\nWe accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including environmental remediation and potential legal claims. When our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we make accruals. We base our estimates on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome, including consultation with external experts and counsel. We revise these estimates as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved.\nWe also make estimates related to future payments for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations. Environmental costs include costs for studies and testing as well as remediation and restoration. We sometimes make these estimates with the assistance of third parties involved in monitoring the remediation effort.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were not aware of any contingencies or liabilities that would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued and Recently Adopted\nWe have adopted guidance under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related ASUs (collectively \"ASC 606\") as of January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption date for our material equity method investment in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC will follow the non-public business entity adoption date of January 1, 2019 for its stand-alone financial statements. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this guidance, the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to improve the transparency and comparability among companies by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption.\nIn preparation for adoption of the new lease standard, we have reviewed the practical expedients that are available to facilitate the adoption process. We plan to elect to take the \"package\" of practical expedients set out in the standard, which must be elected together. The items within the package stipulate that an entity need not reassess: (1) if expired or existing contracts contain leases, (2) lease classification for previously-assessed leases under ASC 840, and (3) initial direct costs for existing leases. We will also elect to adopt the practical expedient relating to the separation of lease and non-lease components as well as the easement and right of way expedient. Finally we will elect to utilize the optional transition method which allows the company to only apply the new lease standard at the date of adoption while comparative periods will be presented under the previous lease guidance. We will not adopt the hindsight practical expedient.\nAs a result of adopting the new lease standard, we expect an impact on our consolidated balance sheet from the recognition of a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability of less than $250 million. We do not expect a material impact to partners capital as a result of our transition adjustment.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that addresses how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method to each period presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We reclassified $15.3 million and $15.6 million from operating cash flows to investing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715). ASU 2017-07 requires employers to separate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost in the period. The new standard requires the other components of net benefit costs (excluding service costs), be reclassified to \"Other expense\" from \"General and administrative.\" We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018. This standard is applied retrospectively. The effect was not material to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the goodwill impairment testing at annual or interim periods. The guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment testing process, and any identified impairment charge would be simplified to be the difference between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit, but would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit in question. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019. We elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nWe are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol GEL.\u201d We are (i) a provider of an integrated suite of midstream services - primarily transportation, storage, sulfur removal, blending, terminalling and processing-for a large area of the Gulf Coast region of the crude oil and natural gas industry and (ii) one of the leading producers in the world of natural soda ash. Our sulfur removal business results in us being the largest producer, we believe, in the world of sodium hydrosulfide (or NaHS, pronounced nash\u201d).\nHistorically, a substantial majority of our focus has been on the midstream segment of the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. We provide an integrated suite of services to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises and have a diverse portfolio of assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. Our Alkali Business mines and processes trona from which it produces natural soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), a basic building block for a number of ubiquitous products, including flat glass, container glass, dry detergent and a variety of chemicals and other industrial products. Our Alkali Business has a diverse customer base in the United States, Canada, the European Community, the European Free Trade Area and the South African Customs Union with many long-term relationships. It has been operating for almost 70 years and has an estimated remaining reserve life (based on 2018 production) of over 100 years.\nWithin our legacy midstream business, we have two distinct, complementary types of operations-(i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners, which includes our sulfur removal, transportation, storage, and other handling services. Our onshore-based operations occur upstream of, at, and downstream of refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we aggregate, purchase, gather and transport crude oil, which we sell to refiners. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in sulfur removal/balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for finished refined petroleum products and certain refining by-products. In our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, we provide services to one of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S.-the Gulf of Mexico, a producing region representing approximately 16% of the crude oil production in the U.S. in 2018. Our legacy midstream business has a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nIncluded in Management's Discussion and Analysis are the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview of 2018 Results \n \u2022 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Other Consolidated Results \n \u2022 Financial Measures \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nOverview of 2018 Results\nWe reported Net Loss Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $6.1 million, or $0.62 per common unit, in 2018 compared to Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $82.6 million, or $0.50 per common unit, in 2017. The decrease was principally due to impairment expense of $126.3 million recognized during 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in depreciation and interest expense during 2018 of $60.7 million and $52.4 million, respectively, primarily attributable to owning our Alkali assets for a full year and the interest on the debt associated with that acquisition.\nThese decreases to net income were offset by an increase in our reported Segment Margin (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") of $118.2 million principally due to twelve months of contribution from our Alkali Business during 2018 relative to four months during 2017 and the increase in volumes in our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily in Louisiana. Additionally, we recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $8.4 million associated with the valuation of our embedded derivative on our Class A Convertible Preferred Units recognized during 2018 compared to an unrealized loss reported in 2017 of approximately $10.5 million (both of which are recorded in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations).\nCash flow from operating activities was $390.0 million for the 2018 period compared to $323.6 million for 2017, primarily driven by an increase in Segment Margin of $118.2 million during 2018 relative to 2017, partially offset by an increase in working capital effects of $12.3 million during 2018 relative to 2017.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") increased $77.1 million in 2018 to $466.1 million as compared to 2017 Available Cash before Reserves of $389.0 million. See \"Financial Measures\" below for additional information on Available Cash before Reserves.\nSegment Margin was $712.8 million in 2018, an increase of $118.2 million, or 20%, as compared to 2017. This increase resulted primarily from higher contributions from our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment (principally due to owning our Alkali Business for a full year in 2018 as compared to four months during 2017) and our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily attributable to our increased volumes during 2018 from our recently constructed assets in Louisiana and Texas, partially offset by smaller decreases in our other segments.\nIn 2018, we continued our path to de-leveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our financial flexibility to continue building long term value to stakeholders. We continued to find opportunities to right size our businesses and, during 2018, divested certain of our non-core assets to accelerate our goal to de-leverage our balance sheet. These steps, along with stable cash flows from our recently completed acquisition of our Alkali Business and the contribution from our recent strategic investments, we believe further enhance our financial flexibility to opportunistically pursue accretive organic projects and acquisitions should they present themselves. Additionally, we have situated ourselves well for future increases in volumes in our offshore business due to the long-lived reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that requires little or no additional investment from us. Overall, we believe these actions to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility are the best actions we can take to allow us to generate strong optimal returns for our unitholders in the years ahead.\nWe currently manage our businesses through four divisions that constitute our reportable segments - offshore pipeline transportation, sodium minerals and sulfur services, onshore facilities and transportation and marine transportation.\nA more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs is included below in \"Results of Operations\".\nDistributions to Unitholders\nOn February 14, 2019, we paid a distribution of $0.55 per unit related to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWith respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we have declared a payment-in-kind or PIK of the quarterly distribution, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 534,576 Class A Convertible Preferred Units. This PIK amount equates to a distribution of $0.7374 per Class A Convertible Preferred Unit for the 2018 Quarter, or $2.9496 annualized. These distributions were paid on February 14, 2019 to unitholders holders of record at the close of business January 31, 2019.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives\nAlkali Business Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. During 2018, we continued to integrate the Alkali business and the results of the business have exceeded our expectations to date.\nBaton Rouge Area Infrastructure Expansion\nWe expanded our existing Baton Rouge area infrastructure to allow for greater capacity and flexibility in servicing our major refinery customer in the region. This expansion included the construction of an additional 500,000 barrels of crude oil tankage at our existing Baton Rouge Terminal. Additionally, this expansion included the upgrading of pumping and other infrastructure capabilities in order to allow for the efficient handling of expected increases in crude oil volumes received at our Baton Rouge area facilities. These assets became operational in the first half of 2018.\nPowder River Basin Midstream Assets Divestiture\nOn October 11, 2018, we completed the divestiture of our Powder River Basin midstream assets and received total net proceeds of approximately $300 million that we utilized to reduce the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nResults of Operations\nIn the discussions that follow, we will focus on our revenues, expenses and net income, as well as two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations-Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves are defined in the \"Financial Measures\" section below.\nRevenues, Costs and Expenses\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $884.4 million, or 44%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, our costs and expenses (excluding gains on sale of assets and impairment expense) increased $810.4 million, or 45%, between the two periods. These increases are primarily attributable to the effects of a full year of results from our Alkali Business during 2018, along with the increase in crude oil prices during 2018 that proportionately impacted our revenues and cost of sales.\nThe addition of our Alkali Business resulted in a large increase in revenues and costs relative to 2017 (which are reflected in our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment). Those increases are principally derived from mining trona ore and processing the entrained mineral sodium carbonate, also known as naturally occurring soda ash. Natural soda ash has significant cost advantages over synthetically produced soda ash, which we believe will exist for the foreseeable future. Natural soda ash accounts for only about 25% of the world's production; thus, we believe we should be able to somewhat mitigate the effects of market-specific factors (e.g., changes in sales prices for our products, our operating costs, and other economic considerations) on Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves, and Segment Margin in the soda ash market in which we operate.\nIn addition to our Alkali Business, we continue to operate in our other legacy businesses, including: (i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties; and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners. Refiners are the shippers of approximately 80% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contract for over 80% of the use of our inland barges, which are used primarily to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Their large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in relatively low commodity price environments. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in commodity prices to impact our Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin derived from our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations in the same manner in which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\nA substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products through our onshore facilities and transportation segment. In addition, our revenues and costs between these two periods have been impacted by increases in market prices associated with our crude oil and petroleum product sales as discussed further below. In general, we do not expect fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas to materially affect our net income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin to the same extent they affect our revenues and costs. We have limited our direct commodity price exposure in our crude oil and petroleum products operations through the broad use of fee-based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements, and hedges. As a result, changes in the price of crude oil\nwould proportionately impact both our revenues and our costs, with a disproportionately smaller net impact on our Segment Margin.\nAs discussed throughout this document, we have some indirect exposure to certain changes in prices for oil and petroleum products, particularly if they are significant and extended. We tend to experience more demand for certain of our services when prices increase significantly over extended periods of time, and we tend to experience less demand for certain of our services when prices decrease significantly over extended periods of time. For additional information regarding certain of our indirect exposure to commodity prices, see our segment-by-segment analysis below and the previous section entitled Risks Related to Our Business\u201d.\nPrices of crude oil have increased since December 31, 2017. The average closing prices for West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") increased 27% to $64.74 per barrel on a year to date average for 2018, as compared to $50.95 per barrel for 2017. We would expect changes in crude oil prices to continue to proportionately affect our revenues and costs attributable to our purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products, producing minimal direct impact on Segment Margin from those operations. However, due to the indirect exposure to changes in prices discussed above and in the discussion surrounding our onshore facilities and transportation segment, crude oil and petroleum product sales volumes decreased 11% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAdditionally, changes in certain of our operating costs between the respective periods, including those associated with our offshore pipeline and marine transportation segments, are not directly correlated with commodity prices. We discuss certain of those costs in further detail below in our segment-by-segment analysis.\nIncluded below is additional detailed discussion of the results of our operations focusing on Segment Margin and other costs including general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes.\nSegment Margin\nThe contribution of each of our segments to total Segment Margin in each of the last three years was as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOffshore Pipeline Transportation Segment\nOperating results and volumetric data for our offshore pipeline transportation segment are presented below:\n\n (1) Offshore pipeline transportation Segment Margin includes distributions received from our offshore pipeline joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (GEL Offshore Pipeline, LLC, or \"GOPL\") owns our undivided interest in the Eugene Island pipeline system. \n (3) Volumes are the product of our effective ownership interest throughout the year, including changes in ownership interest, multiplied by the relevant throughput over the given year.  Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for 2018 decreased $32.5 million, or 10%, from 2017, primarily due to lower volumes. During 2018, we experienced a greater amount of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at several of the production facilities connected to our offshore infrastructure. Additionally, during 2018, three particular major fields underperformed our expectations. Offsetting this in future years are two subsea tie-backs to the same dedicated in-field production facility scheduled to come on-line during the second half of 2019, which requires minimal to no additional capital investment from the partnership. We believe that one of the fields is underperforming as a result of reservoir quality degradation, and not due to mechanical factors. We believe that the other two large underperforming fields are predominately underperforming as the result of slower production rates than those that were communicated to us last year due to the operator's\nreserve recovery maximization efforts. Notwithstanding these short term negatives, we are currently seeing increasing demand for our assets from production that is currently dedicated to 3rd party pipelines but is unable to get to shore due to a lack of capacity on such pipelines. Given our excess capacity and connectivity on certain of our systems, we expect to benefit from this takeaway capacity constraint in future periods.\nIn addition, the minimum bill reservation fees we collect on one of our offshore oil pipelines had a prior year step down, and we collected approximately $4.4 million less in segment margin in 2018 relative to 2017. Lastly, 2017 included contributions of approximately $2.0 million from certain of our previously owned gas pipeline and platform assets that were divested during the second quarter of 2017.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\n\n (1) Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business. \n (2) Source: IHS Chemical  Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2018 increased $130.2 million, or 100%, from 2017. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business for twelve months during 2018 compared to four months during 2017, beginning with the acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2019. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation). Additionally, our refinery services business continues to perform well with increased NaHS volumes of approximately 13% during 2018 as they benefited from increased demand from certain of our international mining customers, primarily located in South America and our domestic mining and pulp and paper customers.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOur onshore facilities and transportation segment utilizes an integrated set of pipelines and terminals, as well as trucks, railcars, and barges to facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products on behalf of producers, refiners and other customers. This segment includes crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminals, rail facilities and CO2 pipelines operating\nprimarily within the United States Gulf Coast crude oil market. In addition, we utilize our railcar and trucking fleets that support the purchase and sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil, as well as purchased and sold refined products. Through these assets we offer our customers a full suite of services, including the following:\n \u2022 facilitating the transportation of crude oil from producers to refineries and from owned and third party terminals to refiners via pipelines; \n \u2022 transporting CO2 from natural and anthropogenic sources to crude oil fields owned by our customers; \n \u2022 shipping crude oil and refined products to and from producers and refiners via trucks, railcars and pipelines; \n \u2022 loading and unloading railcars at our crude-by-rail terminals; \n \u2022 storing and blending of crude oil and intermediate and finished refined products; \n \u2022 purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining; and \n \u2022 purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending those products to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets;  We also may use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions for crude oil gathering and marketing and to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products.\nDespite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity, sulfur content and metals content. The refineries evaluate the costs to obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help the refineries in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources and transport crude oil meeting their requirements. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting the refiners' requirements may also provide opportunities for us to utilize our purchasing and logistical skills to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our crude oil purchase contracts contains a market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transportation and to provide us with a margin. Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the chemical composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials.\nIn our refined products marketing operations, we supply primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products to wholesale markets and some end-users such as paper mills and utilities. We also provide a service to refineries by purchasing heavier\u201d petroleum products that are the residual fuels from gasoline production, transporting them to one of our terminals and blending them to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers.\nOperating results for our onshore facilities and transportation segment were as follows: \n (1) Total daily volume for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 includes 55,202 and 56,748 barrels per day respectively of intermediate refined products associated with our Port of Baton Rouge Terminal pipelines which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n (2) The volumes presented for 2018 represent the average barrels/day through September 30, 2018, as the relevant assets were divested in October 2018. \n (3) Includes total barrels for unloading at all rail facilities.  Segment Margin for our onshore facilities and transportation segment increased $23.5 million, or 24% , in 2018 as compared to 2017. The 2018 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was slightly offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. Additionally, while volumes were relatively constant on our Texas system between 2018 and 2017, we were able to recognize a full 12 months of minimum volume commitments in segment margin during 2018 compared to 7 months during 2017, as the expansion and re-purposing of our system was completed during the second quarter of 2017.\nMarine Transportation Segment\nWithin our marine transportation segment, we own a fleet of 91 barges (82 inland and 9 offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of 3.2 million barrels, 42 push/tow boats (33 inland and 9 offshore), and a 330,000 barrel ocean going tanker, the M/T American Phoenix. Operating results for our marine transportation segment were as follows:\n\n(1) Under certain of our marine contracts, we \"rebill\" our customers for a portion of our operating costs.\n(2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and drydocking.\nMarine Transportation Segment Margin for 2018 decreased $3.0 million, or 6%, from 2017. The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily attributable to our offshore barge fleet entering into short term spot price contracts, which can lead to a less favorable rebill structure and higher operating costs, as our last legacy term contract rolled off during the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in operating costs during 2018 relative to 2017 due to the increase in our dry-docking costs. We have continued to enter into short term contracts (less than a year) in both the inland and offshore markets because we believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows. While we are reasonably hopeful that we've reached a bottom for the quarterly segment margin from our entire fleet of assets, we have no expectation of the fundamentals for marine transportation showing any significant improvement through at least the next several years. This excludes the M/T American Phoenix which is under long term contract through September 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increased segment margin in the 2018 period related to the M/T American Phoenix. During 2017, the M/T American Phoenix underwent its planned regulatory dry-docking inspections which negatively impacted segment margin. Additionally, the 2018 period also had higher utilization on our inland barge operation.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million between 2018 and 2017. This is primarily attributable to an increase in our overall long term incentive compensation plan expense due to valuation assumptions used\nbetween the two periods. This increase was partially offset by lower third party financing, legal and accounting costs surrounding our acquisition and disposition activities in 2018 relative to 2017, including the acquisition of our Alkali Business.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization expense \nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased $60.7 million between 2018 and 2017 primarily as a result of placing additional assets into service, including those acquired as a part of our Alkali Business and certain of our organic growth projects that were recently placed in service.\nInterest expense, net\n\nNet interest expense increased $52.4 million during 2018 primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and constructed assets, including the financing of the acquisition of our Alkali Business in 2017, along with an increase in libor rates during 2018 which is a major component in the interest expense derived on our senior secured credit facility. In addition, capitalized interest decreased as result of certain of our large organic growth projects being completed and placed into service throughout 2017.\nOther Consolidated Results\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 included impairment expense of approximately $126.3 million recognized during 2018 including: (i) an impairment of $23.1 million on the goodwill associated with our supply and logistics reporting unit, which primarily consists of our legacy crude oil and refined products marketing and trucking businesses; (ii) an impairment of certain of our non-core offshore gas pipeline and platform assets of approximately $82.0 million for which the abandonment timing has accelerated; and (iii) a write-down of approximately $21.2 million related to our remaining non-core assets in the Powder River Basin(refer to Note 7 and Note 10).\nNet income (loss) included an unrealized gain on the valuation of our embedded derivative associated with our preferred units of $8.4 million in 2018 compared to an unrealized loss of $10.5 million during 2017. Those amounts are included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOffshore Pipeline Transportation Segment\nOperating results and volumetric data for our offshore pipeline transportation segment are presented below:\n\n (1) Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin includes distributions received from our offshore pipeline joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting in 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (GEL Offshore Pipeline, LLC, or \"GOPL\") owns our undivided interest in the Eugene Island pipeline system. \n (3) Volumes are the product of our effective ownership interest throughout the year, including changes in ownership interest, multiplied by the relevant throughput over the given year.  Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for 2017 decreased $19.1 million, or 6%, from 2016. The year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by both anticipated and unanticipated downtime at several major fields, including weather-related downtime, affecting certain of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico customers and thus certain of our key crude oil and natural gas assets, including our Poseidon pipeline and certain associated laterals which we own. The 2017 period also reflects the effects of a contractual adjustment to a lower rate for a lateral we own that will be in place going forward. In addition, we benefited in 2016 from the temporary diversion of certain natural gas volumes from third party gas pipelines to one of our gas pipelines and related facilities due to one-time disruptions at onshore processing facilities where such volumes typically flow.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\n\n (1) Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business. \n (2) Source: IHS Chemical  Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2017 increased $50.8 million, or 64%, from 2016. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business since our acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2018 as we continue to remain the global leader in natural soda ash production. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation).\nThese contributions were partially offset by the results of our sulfur removal business and related NaHS and caustic soda activities. Our 2017 results for these activities were in line with our expectations and include the effects of previously disclosed commercial discussions with certain of our host refineries and several NaHS customers, which resulted in extending the term and tenor of a large number of contractual relationships.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our onshore facilities and transportation segment were as follows: \n (1) Total daily volume for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes 56,748 and 8,997 barrels per day respectively of intermediate refined products associated with our Port of Baton Rouge Terminal pipelines which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, this includes 14,117 barrels per day for the year ended December 31, 2017 of crude oil associated with our new Raceland Pipeline which became fully operational in the second quarter of 2017. \n (2) Includes total barrels for either loading or unloading at all rail facilities.  Segment Margin for our onshore facilities and transportation segment increased $13 million, or 16%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The 2017 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was principally offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. In addition, the 2017 period was negatively impacted by lower volumes on our Texas pipeline system, as the repurposing of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and expansion of our terminal infrastructure did not became operational until the second quarter of 2017 (while a large portion of 2016 included historical volumes on our legacy Texas pipeline system assets prior to the repurposing project).\nMarine Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our marine transportation segment were as follows:\n\n(1) Under certain of our marine contracts, we \"rebill\" our customers for a portion of our operating costs.\n(2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and drydocking.\nMarine Transportation Segment Margin for 2017 decreased $19.8 million, or 28% from 2016. The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily due to lower day rates on our inland and offshore fleets (which offset higher utilization as adjusted for planned dry docking time in our offshore fleet). The M/T American Phoenix also underwent planned regulatory dry docking inspections for approximately one month during 2017, which negatively impacted Segment Margin. In our inland fleet, weaker demand continued to apply pressure on our rates, which we expect to continue into 2018. In our offshore barge fleet, as a number of our units have come off longer term contracts, we have continued to choose to primarily place them in spot service or short-term (less than a year) service because we continue to believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $21 million between 2017 and 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the third party financing, legal and accounting costs surrounding our acquisition of our Alkali Business in 2017, as well as an increase in certain accruals made for a variety of items, including approximately $7.5 million relating to our annual bonus program. This was partially offset by the effects of changes in assumptions used to value our equity based compensation awards that are tied to our unit price.\nDepreciation and amortization expense \nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses increased $30 million between 2017 and 2016 primarily as a result of placing additional assets into service, including those acquired as a part of our Alkali Business in 2017.\nInterest expense, net\n\nNet interest expense increased $37 million during 2017 primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and constructed assets, including the financing of the acquisition of our Alkali Business in 2017. In addition, capitalized interest decreased as result of certain of our large organic growth projects being completed and placed into service throughout 2017.\nOther Consolidated Results\nNet income included an unrealized loss on derivative positions, excluding fair value hedges, of $10.9 million in 2017 and an unrealized loss of $1.3 million in 2016. Those amounts are included in onshore facilities and transportation product costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are not a component of Segment Margin. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $40.3 million of gains resulting from the sale of certain non-core assets, as well as a $12.6 million non-cash provision relating to certain leased railcars no longer in use.\nFinancial Measures\nOverview\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the financial measure of Available Cash before Reserves, which is a non-GAAP\u201d measure because it is not contemplated by or referenced in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). We also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the relevant data points considered from time to time.\nWhen evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance, liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of\ndirectors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.\nSegment Margin\nWe define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses, and segment general and administrative expenses, after eliminating gain or loss on sale of assets, plus or minus applicable Select Items. Although, we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment.\nA reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves\nPurposes, Uses and Definition\nAvailable Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:\n (1) the financial performance of our assets; \n (2) our operating performance; \n (3) the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry; \n (4) the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and \n (5) our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.  We define Available Cash before Reserves ( Available Cash before Reserves\u201d) as net income(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, Select Items\u201d), as adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, net interest expense and cash tax expense. Although, we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. The most significant Select Items in the relevant reporting periods are set forth below.\n\n(1) Represents the difference in timing of cash receipts from customers during the period and the revenue we recognize in accordance with GAAP on our related contracts. For purposes of our Non-GAAP measures, we add those amounts in the period of payment and deduct them in the period in which GAAP recognizes them.\n(2) Represents the net effect of adding cash receipts from direct financing leases and deducting expenses relating to direct financing leases.\n(3) Represents the net effect of adding distributions from equity investees and deducting earnings of equity investees net to us.\n(4) Represents all Select Items applicable to Segment Margin.\n(5) Represents transaction costs relating to certain merger, acquisition, transition and financing transactions incurred in advance of acquisition.\n(6) Includes general and administrative costs associated with certain dispute costs during 2018.\n(7) Represents Select Items applicable to Available Cash before Reserves.\nDisclosure Format Relating to Maintenance Capital\nWe use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time. We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.\nMaintenance Capital Requirements\nMAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.\nPrior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.\nBeginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.\nIn summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management's increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nWe are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol GEL.\u201d We are (i) a provider of an integrated suite of midstream services - primarily transportation, storage, sulfur removal, blending, terminalling and processing-for a large area of the Gulf Coast region of the crude oil and natural gas industry and (ii) one of the leading producers in the world of natural soda ash. Our sulfur removal business results in us being the largest producer, we believe, in the world of sodium hydrosulfide (or NaHS, pronounced nash\u201d).\nHistorically, a substantial majority of our focus has been on the midstream segment of the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. We provide an integrated suite of services to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises and have a diverse portfolio of assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. Our Alkali Business mines and processes trona from which it produces natural soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), a basic building block for a number of ubiquitous products, including flat glass, container glass, dry detergent and a variety of chemicals and other industrial products. Our Alkali Business has a diverse customer base in the United States, Canada, the European Community, the European Free Trade Area and the South African Customs Union with many long-term relationships. It has been operating for almost 70 years and has an estimated remaining reserve life (based on 2018 production) of over 100 years.\nWithin our legacy midstream business, we have two distinct, complementary types of operations-(i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners, which includes our sulfur removal, transportation, storage, and other handling services. Our onshore-based operations occur upstream of, at, and downstream of refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we aggregate, purchase, gather and transport crude oil, which we sell to refiners. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in sulfur removal/balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for finished refined petroleum products and certain refining by-products. In our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, we provide services to one of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S.-the Gulf of Mexico, a producing region representing approximately 16% of the crude oil production in the U.S. in 2018. Our legacy midstream business has a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks.\nIncluded in Management's Discussion and Analysis are the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview of 2018 Results \n \u2022 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Other Consolidated Results \n \u2022 Financial Measures \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nOverview of 2018 Results\nWe reported Net Loss Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $6.1 million, or $0.62 per common unit, in 2018 compared to Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $82.6 million, or $0.50 per common unit, in 2017. The decrease was principally due to impairment expense of $126.3 million recognized during 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in depreciation and interest expense during 2018 of $60.7 million and $52.4 million, respectively, primarily attributable to owning our Alkali assets for a full year and the interest on the debt associated with that acquisition.\nThese decreases to net income were offset by an increase in our reported Segment Margin (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") of $118.2 million principally due to twelve months of contribution from our Alkali Business during 2018 relative to four months during 2017 and the increase in volumes in our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily in Louisiana. Additionally, we recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $8.4 million associated with the valuation of our embedded derivative on our Class A Convertible Preferred Units recognized during 2018 compared to an unrealized loss reported in 2017 of approximately $10.5 million (both of which are recorded in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations).\nCash flow from operating activities was $390.0 million for the 2018 period compared to $323.6 million for 2017, primarily driven by an increase in Segment Margin of $118.2 million during 2018 relative to 2017, partially offset by an increase in working capital effects of $12.3 million during 2018 relative to 2017.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves (as defined below in \"Financial Measures\") increased $77.1 million in 2018 to $466.1 million as compared to 2017 Available Cash before Reserves of $389.0 million. See \"Financial Measures\" below for additional information on Available Cash before Reserves.\nSegment Margin was $712.8 million in 2018, an increase of $118.2 million, or 20%, as compared to 2017. This increase resulted primarily from higher contributions from our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment (principally due to owning our Alkali Business for a full year in 2018 as compared to four months during 2017) and our onshore facilities and transportation segment, primarily attributable to our increased volumes during 2018 from our recently constructed assets in Louisiana and Texas, partially offset by smaller decreases in our other segments.\nIn 2018, we continued our path to de-leveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our financial flexibility to continue building long term value to stakeholders. We continued to find opportunities to right size our businesses and, during 2018, divested certain of our non-core assets to accelerate our goal to de-leverage our balance sheet. These steps, along with stable cash flows from our recently completed acquisition of our Alkali Business and the contribution from our recent strategic investments, we believe further enhance our financial flexibility to opportunistically pursue accretive organic projects and acquisitions should they present themselves. Additionally, we have situated ourselves well for future increases in volumes in our offshore business due to the long-lived reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that requires little or no additional investment from us. Overall, we believe these actions to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility are the best actions we can take to allow us to generate strong optimal returns for our unitholders in the years ahead.\nWe currently manage our businesses through four divisions that constitute our reportable segments - offshore pipeline transportation, sodium minerals and sulfur services, onshore facilities and transportation and marine transportation.\nA more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs is included below in \"Results of Operations\".\nDistributions to Unitholders\nOn February 14, 2019, we paid a distribution of $0.55 per unit related to the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWith respect to our Class A Convertible Preferred Units, we have declared a payment-in-kind or PIK of the quarterly distribution, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 534,576 Class A Convertible Preferred Units. This PIK amount equates to a distribution of $0.7374 per Class A Convertible Preferred Unit for the 2018 Quarter, or $2.9496 annualized. These distributions were paid on February 14, 2019 to unitholders holders of record at the close of business January 31, 2019.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Growth Initiatives\nAlkali Business Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2017, we acquired our trona and trona-based exploring, mining, processing, producing, marketing and selling business based in Wyoming (our Alkali Business\u201d) for approximately $1.325 billion in cash. During 2018, we continued to integrate the Alkali business and the results of the business have exceeded our expectations to date.\nBaton Rouge Area Infrastructure Expansion\nWe expanded our existing Baton Rouge area infrastructure to allow for greater capacity and flexibility in servicing our major refinery customer in the region. This expansion included the construction of an additional 500,000 barrels of crude oil tankage at our existing Baton Rouge Terminal. Additionally, this expansion included the upgrading of pumping and other infrastructure capabilities in order to allow for the efficient handling of expected increases in crude oil volumes received at our Baton Rouge area facilities. These assets became operational in the first half of 2018.\nPowder River Basin Midstream Assets Divestiture\nOn October 11, 2018, we completed the divestiture of our Powder River Basin midstream assets and received total net proceeds of approximately $300 million that we utilized to reduce the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nResults of Operations\nIn the discussions that follow, we will focus on our revenues, expenses and net income, as well as two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations-Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves are defined in the \"Financial Measures\" section below.\nRevenues, Costs and Expenses\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $884.4 million, or 44%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, our costs and expenses (excluding gains on sale of assets and impairment expense) increased $810.4 million, or 45%, between the two periods. These increases are primarily attributable to the effects of a full year of results from our Alkali Business during 2018, along with the increase in crude oil prices during 2018 that proportionately impacted our revenues and cost of sales.\nThe addition of our Alkali Business resulted in a large increase in revenues and costs relative to 2017 (which are reflected in our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment). Those increases are principally derived from mining trona ore and processing the entrained mineral sodium carbonate, also known as naturally occurring soda ash. Natural soda ash has significant cost advantages over synthetically produced soda ash, which we believe will exist for the foreseeable future. Natural soda ash accounts for only about 25% of the world's production; thus, we believe we should be able to somewhat mitigate the effects of market-specific factors (e.g., changes in sales prices for our products, our operating costs, and other economic considerations) on Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves, and Segment Margin in the soda ash market in which we operate.\nIn addition to our Alkali Business, we continue to operate in our other legacy businesses, including: (i) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties; and (ii) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners. Refiners are the shippers of approximately 80% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contract for over 80% of the use of our inland barges, which are used primarily to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Their large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in relatively low commodity price environments. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in commodity prices to impact our Net Income(loss), Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin derived from our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations in the same manner in which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products.\nA substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products through our onshore facilities and transportation segment. In addition, our revenues and costs between these two periods have been impacted by increases in market prices associated with our crude oil and petroleum product sales as discussed further below. In general, we do not expect fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas to materially affect our net income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin to the same extent they affect our revenues and costs. We have limited our direct commodity price exposure in our crude oil and petroleum products operations through the broad use of fee-based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements, and hedges. As a result, changes in the price of crude oil\nwould proportionately impact both our revenues and our costs, with a disproportionately smaller net impact on our Segment Margin.\nAs discussed throughout this document, we have some indirect exposure to certain changes in prices for oil and petroleum products, particularly if they are significant and extended. We tend to experience more demand for certain of our services when prices increase significantly over extended periods of time, and we tend to experience less demand for certain of our services when prices decrease significantly over extended periods of time. For additional information regarding certain of our indirect exposure to commodity prices, see our segment-by-segment analysis below and the previous section entitled Risks Related to Our Business\u201d.\nPrices of crude oil have increased since December 31, 2017. The average closing prices for West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") increased 27% to $64.74 per barrel on a year to date average for 2018, as compared to $50.95 per barrel for 2017. We would expect changes in crude oil prices to continue to proportionately affect our revenues and costs attributable to our purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products, producing minimal direct impact on Segment Margin from those operations. However, due to the indirect exposure to changes in prices discussed above and in the discussion surrounding our onshore facilities and transportation segment, crude oil and petroleum product sales volumes decreased 11% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAdditionally, changes in certain of our operating costs between the respective periods, including those associated with our offshore pipeline and marine transportation segments, are not directly correlated with commodity prices. We discuss certain of those costs in further detail below in our segment-by-segment analysis.\nIncluded below is additional detailed discussion of the results of our operations focusing on Segment Margin and other costs including general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes.\nSegment Margin\nThe contribution of each of our segments to total

accounting in 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (GEL Offshore Pipeline, LLC, or \"GOPL\") owns our undivided interest in the Eugene Island pipeline system. \n (3) Volumes are the product of our effective ownership interest throughout the year, including changes in ownership interest, multiplied by the relevant throughput over the given year.  Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for 2018 decreased $32.5 million, or 10%, from 2017, primarily due to lower volumes. During 2018, we experienced a greater amount of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at several of the production facilities connected to our offshore infrastructure. Additionally, during 2018, three particular major fields underperformed our expectations. Offsetting this in future years are two subsea tie-backs to the same dedicated in-field production facility scheduled to come on-line during the second half of 2019, which requires minimal to no additional capital investment from the partnership. We believe that one of the fields is underperforming as a result of reservoir quality degradation, and not due to mechanical factors. We believe that the other two large underperforming fields are predominately underperforming as the result of slower production rates than those that were communicated to us last year due to the operator's\nreserve recovery maximization efforts. Notwithstanding these short term negatives, we are currently seeing increasing demand for our assets from production that is currently dedicated to 3rd party pipelines but is unable to get to shore due to a lack of capacity on such pipelines. Given our excess capacity and connectivity on certain of our systems, we expect to benefit from this takeaway capacity constraint in future periods.\nIn addition, the minimum bill reservation fees we collect on one of our offshore oil pipelines had a prior year step down, and we collected approximately $4.4 million less in segment margin in 2018 relative to 2017. Lastly, 2017 included contributions of approximately $2.0 million from certain of our previously owned gas pipeline and platform assets that were divested during the second quarter of 2017.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes sold :\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS volumes (Dry short tons \"DST\")\n</td> <td>150,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Soda Ash volumes (short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>3,669,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,274,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) volumes (dry short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>110,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>3,929,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS revenues, excluding non-cash revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) revenues\n</td> <td>61,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues associated with Alkali Business\n</td> <td>829,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>7,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total external segment revenues, excluding non-cash revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,078,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium minerals and sulfur services operating costs, excluding non-cash items\n</td> <td>(818,290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(340,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average index price for NaOH per DST (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business. \n (2) Source: IHS Chemical  Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2018 increased $130.2 million, or 100%, from 2017. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business for twelve months during 2018 compared to four months during 2017, beginning with the acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2019. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation). Additionally, our refinery services business continues to perform well with increased NaHS volumes of approximately 13% during 2018 as they benefited from increased demand from certain of our international mining customers, primarily located in South America and our domestic mining and pulp and paper customers.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOur onshore facilities and transportation segment utilizes an integrated set of pipelines and terminals, as well as trucks, railcars, and barges to facilitate the movement of crude oil and refined products on behalf of producers, refiners and other customers. This segment includes crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminals, rail facilities and CO2 pipelines operating\nprimarily within the United States Gulf Coast crude oil market. In addition, we utilize our railcar and trucking fleets that support the purchase and sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil, as well as purchased and sold refined products. Through these assets we offer our customers a full suite of services, including the following:\n \u2022 facilitating the transportation of crude oil from producers to refineries and from owned and third party terminals to refiners via pipelines; \n \u2022 transporting CO2 from natural and anthropogenic sources to crude oil fields owned by our customers; \n \u2022 shipping crude oil and refined products to and from producers and refiners via trucks, railcars and pipelines; \n \u2022 loading and unloading railcars at our crude-by-rail terminals; \n \u2022 storing and blending of crude oil and intermediate and finished refined products; \n \u2022 purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining; and \n \u2022 purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending those products to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets;  We also may use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions for crude oil gathering and marketing and to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products.\nDespite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity, sulfur content and metals content. The refineries evaluate the costs to obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help the refineries in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources and transport crude oil meeting their requirements. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting the refiners' requirements may also provide opportunities for us to utilize our purchasing and logistical skills to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our crude oil purchase contracts contains a market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transportation and to provide us with a margin. Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the chemical composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials.\nIn our refined products marketing operations, we supply primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products to wholesale markets and some end-users such as paper mills and utilities.

The 2018 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was slightly offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. Additionally, while volumes were relatively constant on our Texas system between 2018 and 2017, we were able to recognize a full 12 months of minimum volume commitments in segment margin during 2018 compared to 7 months during 2017, as the expansion and re-purposing of our system was completed during the second quarter of 2017.\nMarine Transportation Segment\nWithin our marine transportation segment, we own a fleet of 91 barges (82 inland and 9 offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of 3.2 million barrels, 42 push/tow boats (33 inland and 9 offshore), and a 330,000 barrel ocean going tanker, the M/T American Phoenix.

The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily attributable to our offshore barge fleet entering into short term spot price contracts, which can lead to a less favorable rebill structure and higher operating costs, as our last legacy term contract rolled off during the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, we had an increase in operating costs during 2018 relative to 2017 due to the increase in our dry-docking costs. We have continued to enter into short term contracts (less than a year) in both the inland and offshore markets because we believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows. While we are reasonably hopeful that we've reached a bottom for the quarterly segment margin from our entire fleet of assets, we have no expectation of the fundamentals for marine transportation showing any significant improvement through at least the next several years. This excludes the M/T American Phoenix which is under long term contract through September 2020. These decreases were partially offset by increased segment margin in the 2018 period related to the M/T American Phoenix. During 2017, the M/T American Phoenix underwent its planned regulatory dry-docking inspections which negatively impacted segment margin. Additionally, the 2018 period also had higher utilization on our inland barge operation.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses not separately identified below:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment\n</td> <td>4,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive based compensation plan expense\n</td> <td>2,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party costs related to business development activities and growth projects\n</td> <td>9,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million between 2018 and 2017.

Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for 2017 decreased $19.1 million, or 6%, from 2016. The year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by both anticipated and unanticipated downtime at several major fields, including weather-related downtime, affecting certain of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico customers and thus certain of our key crude oil and natural gas assets, including our Poseidon pipeline and certain associated laterals which we own. The 2017 period also reflects the effects of a contractual adjustment to a lower rate for a lateral we own that will be in place going forward. In addition, we benefited in 2016 from the temporary diversion of certain natural gas volumes from third party gas pipelines to one of our gas pipelines and related facilities due to one-time disruptions at onshore processing facilities where such volumes typically flow.\nSodium Minerals and Sulfur Services Segment\nOperating results for our sodium minerals and sulfur services segment were as follows:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes sold:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS volumes (Dry short tons \"DST\")\n</td> <td>133,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Soda Ash volumes (short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>1,274,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) volumes (dry short tons sold) (1)\n</td> <td>84,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,492,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaHS revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NaOH (caustic soda) revenues\n</td> <td>42,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues associated with Alkali Business\n</td> <td>273,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>5,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total external segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sodium minerals and sulfur services operating costs, excluding non-cash items\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(340,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(101,157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average index price for NaOH per DST (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes sales volumes from September 1, 2017, the date on which we acquired our Alkali Business. \n (2) Source: IHS Chemical  Sodium minerals and sulfur services Segment Margin for 2017 increased $50.8 million, or 64%, from 2016. This increase is principally due to the inclusion of contributions from our Alkali Business since our acquisition date of September 1, 2017. The contributions thus far from our Alkali Business have exceeded our expectations and we expect continued strong performance into 2018 as we continue to remain the global leader in natural soda ash production. Costs impacting the results of our Alkali Business, many of which are similar in nature to costs related to our sulfur removal business, include costs associated with processing and producing soda ash (and other Alkali products) and marketing and selling activities. In addition, costs include activities associated with mining and extracting trona ore (including energy costs and employee compensation).\nThese contributions were partially offset by the results of our sulfur removal business and related NaHS and caustic soda activities. Our 2017 results for these activities were in line with our expectations and include the effects of previously disclosed commercial discussions with certain of our host refineries and several NaHS customers, which resulted in extending the term and tenor of a large number of contractual relationships.\nOnshore Facilities and Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our onshore facilities and transportation segment were as follows: Table 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering, marketing, and logistics revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>971,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and CO2 tariffs and revenues from direct financing leases of CO2 pipelines\n</td> <td>67,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments received under direct financing leases not included in income\n</td> <td>6,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and products costs, excluding unrealized gains and losses from derivative transactions\n</td> <td>(866,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(823,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs, excluding non-cash charges for equity-based compensation and other non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>(87,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,592\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric Data (average barrels/day unless otherwise noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas\n</td> <td>32,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jay\n</td> <td>14,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mississippi\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Louisiana (1)\n</td> <td>135,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wyoming\n</td> <td>22,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Onshore crude oil pipelines total\n</td> <td>212,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CO2 pipeline (average Mcf/day):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free State\n</td> <td>77,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil and petroleum products sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total crude oil and petroleum products sales\n</td> <td>51,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail load/unload volumes (2)\n</td> <td>52,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Total daily volume for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes 56,748 and 8,997 barrels per day respectively of intermediate refined products associated with our Port of Baton Rouge Terminal pipelines which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Segment Margin for our onshore facilities and transportation segment increased $13 million, or 16%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The 2017 period includes the effects of the ramp up in volumes on our pipeline, rail and terminal infrastructure on our recently completed infrastructure in the Baton Rouge corridor. This was principally offset by lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. In addition, the 2017 period was negatively impacted by lower volumes on our Texas pipeline system, as the repurposing of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and expansion of our terminal infrastructure did not became operational until the second quarter of 2017 (while a large portion of 2016 included historical volumes on our legacy Texas pipeline system assets prior to the repurposing project).\nMarine Transportation Segment\nOperating results for our marine transportation segment were as follows:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland freight revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore freight revenues\n</td> <td>73,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other rebill revenues (1)\n</td> <td>49,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs, excluding non-cash charges for equity-based compensation and other non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Margin (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fleet Utilization: (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Utilization\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore Barge Utilization\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Under certain of our marine contracts, we \"rebill\" our customers for a portion of our operating costs.\n(2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and drydocking.\nMarine Transportation Segment Margin for 2017 decreased $19.8 million, or 28% from 2016. The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily due to lower day rates on our inland and offshore fleets (which offset higher utilization as adjusted for planned dry docking time in our offshore fleet). The M/T American Phoenix also underwent planned regulatory dry docking inspections for approximately one month during 2017, which negatively impacted Segment Margin. In our inland fleet, weaker demand continued to apply pressure on our rates, which we expect to continue into 2018. In our offshore barge fleet, as a number of our units have come off longer term contracts, we have continued to choose to primarily place them in spot service or short-term (less than a year) service because we continue to believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows.\nOther Costs and Interest\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses not separately identified below:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment\n</td> <td>3,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation plan expense\n</td> <td>(2,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party costs related to business development activities and growth projects\n</td> <td>13,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal general and administrative expenses increased $21 million between 2017 and 2016.

Those amounts are included in onshore facilities and transportation product costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are not a component of Segment Margin. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes $40.3 million of gains resulting from the sale of certain non-core assets, as well as a $12.6 million non-cash provision relating to certain leased railcars no longer in use.\nFinancial Measures\nOverview\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the financial measure of Available Cash before Reserves, which is a non-GAAP\u201d measure because it is not contemplated by or referenced in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). We also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the relevant data points considered from time to time.\nWhen evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance, liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of\ndirectors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.\nSegment Margin\nWe define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses, and segment general and administrative expenses, after eliminating gain or loss on sale of assets, plus or minus applicable Select Items. Although, we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment.\nA reconciliation of Segment Margin to net income (loss) is included in our segment disclosures in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAvailable Cash before Reserves\nPurposes, Uses and Definition\nAvailable Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:\n (1) the financial performance of our assets; \n (2) our operating performance; \n (3) the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry; \n (4) the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and \n (5) our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.  We define Available Cash before Reserves ( Available Cash before Reserves\u201d) as net income(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, Select Items\u201d), as adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, net interest expense and cash tax expense. Although, we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results. The most significant Select Items in the relevant reporting periods are set forth below.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I.\n</td> <td>Applicable to all Non-GAAP Measures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Differences in timing of cash receipts for certain contractual arrangements1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment regarding direct financing leases2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Certain non-cash items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative transactions excluding fair value hedges, net of changes in inventory value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,455\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment regarding equity investees3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Sub-total Select Items, net4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>II.\n</td> <td>Applicable only to Available Cash before Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Certain transaction costs5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Equity compensation adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(207\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Other6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Select Items, net7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the difference in timing of cash receipts from customers during the period and the revenue we recognize in accordance with GAAP on our related contracts.

We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.\nMaintenance Capital Requirements\nMAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.\nPrior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.\nBeginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.\nIn summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management's increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in"}
