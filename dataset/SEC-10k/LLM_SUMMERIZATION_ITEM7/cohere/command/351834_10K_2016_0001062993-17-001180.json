Readers are cautioned that this information may not be appropriate for any other purpose, including investment decisions.\nForward-looking statements contained in this MD&A are based on certain factors and assumptions regarding expected growth, results of operations, performance, and business prospects and opportunities. While we consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements are also subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we currently expect. These factors are more fully described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section at Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nForward-looking statements contained in this commentary are based on our current estimates, expectations and projections, which we believe are reasonable as of the current date. You should not place undue importance on forward-looking statements and should not rely upon this information as of any other date. Other than as required under securities laws, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking information at any particular time.\nUnless otherwise noted herein, all currency amounts in this MD&A are expressed in U.S. dollars. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nThe composition of our reportable segments is as follows:\nGlobal Ingredients aggregates our North American-based Raw Material Sourcing and Supply and European-based International Sourcing and Supply operating segments focused on the procurement and sale of specialty and organic grains and seeds, raw material ingredients, value-added grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and organic commodities.\nConsumer Products consists of three main commercial platforms: Healthy Beverages, Healthy Fruit and Healthy Snacks. Healthy Beverages includes aseptic packaged products including non-dairy and dairy beverages, broths and teas; refrigerated premium juices; and shelf-stable juices and functional waters. Healthy Fruit includes individually quick frozen (\u201cIQF\u201d) fruits for retail; IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice; and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. Healthy Snacks includes fruit snacks; nutritional and protein bars; and resealable pouch products.\nFor a more detailed description of our operating groups and their businesses, please see the \u201cBusiness\u201d section at Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a fiscal calendar that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were each 52-week periods ending on December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, whereas fiscal year 2014 was a 53-week period ending on January 3, 2015. Except as otherwise noted in this MD&A, the impact of the additional week on our results of operations for fiscal year 2014 was insignificant relative to the fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>40 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review\nOn June 27, 2016, we announced that we had engaged external financial and legal advisors to review our operating plan and to evaluate a range of strategic and financial actions that we could undertake to maximize shareholder value. The strategic review arose out of discussions with our largest shareholders, some of which had advocated that we examine value maximization strategies. We also announced that we had engaged a global executive search firm to assist in identifying candidates who could add additional operating, industry and capital markets experience and expertise to our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The strategic review was concluded on October 7, 2016 with our announcement of a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, \u201cOaktree\u201d).\nOn October 7, 2016, Oaktree invested $85.0 million in cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (\u201cSunOpta Foods\u201d). The shares of Preferred Stock are exchangeable into common shares of SunOpta Inc. in accordance with certain terms and conditions. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock were used to repay $79.0 million of borrowings made under our second lien loan agreement.\nValue Creation Plan\nWe are conducting, with the assistance of Oaktree, a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Through this review, management and the Board have developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The statements we make below about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including expected improvements in earnings, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), working capital efficiencies, and expected cash flows, are forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including debt service and capital expenditures.\nWe are currently targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized EBITDA enhancements and $20 million of working capital efficiencies, to be implemented over the coming 12 to 18 months. In the near-term, these benefits are expected to be offset by structural investments we are making in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources. Additionally, during 2017 we anticipate incurring non-structural third-party consulting support, severance, and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, we expect these investments to yield additional improvement in EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. Recent progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below.\nPortfolio Optimization\nThe focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where we are not effectively positioned. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the closing of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility, which is expected to be $4 million accretive to EBITDA in 2017. Following that initial announcement, we continued to evaluate our portfolio which resulted in the following additional actions:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>41 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClosure of our soy extraction (ingredient) facility in Heuvelton, New York, transferring production to our Alexandria, Minnesota facility.\nExited certain varieties of specialty soy and sunflower, as well as frozen edamame.\nExited a non-core vegetable brokerage operation.\nLaunched a global organic ingredients portfolio strategy review, which is identifying incremental large ingredient categories for further investment. The incremental growth opportunities include new geographies, new products and new processing capabilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 million associated with the Heuvelton facility closure, and $3.4 million of inventory and other reserves to reflect the exit of non-core business lines. We intend to continue to proactively manage our business portfolio to identify opportunities to drive EBITDA growth.\nOperational Excellence\nThe focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. These efforts are expected to generate productivity improvements in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. With the assistance of third-party consulting support, we have identified a number of broad-based savings opportunities to be implemented and realized over 2017 and 2018. Recent activities include:\nLaunched network-wide upgrades to worker safety and food quality programs, with the goal of becoming the leader in safety and quality across the healthy food industry.\nLaunched a productivity enhancement program that is systematically evaluating all manufacturing facilities, supply chain, and procurement processes to identify productivity cost savings. As a result of these efforts, we are targeting $30 million in annualized EBITDA improvements to be implemented over the next 12 to 18 months.\nRolled out the \u201cSunOpta Plant Management System\u201d, which consists of a standardized set of operating processes, key performance indicators, and continuous improvement methodologies that will provide improved consistency and productivity performance across the manufacturing network.\nLaunched a working capital optimization program that is targeting $20 million of cash flow enhancements.\nGo-to-Market Effectiveness\nThe focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. We expect efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Early in 2017, we re-aligned our go-to-market approach, hiring key talent to lead foodservice and retail sales, as well as adding new marketing resources. We also launched a sales force effectiveness program that has already started to generate results. Recent highlights include:\nHired a new Senior Vice President of Foodservice Sales and a Senior Vice President of Beverages and Snacks.\nSecured new business wins in Healthy Beverage, Healthy Fruit and Global Ingredients.\nSelectively adjusted pricing to enhance margins.\nProcess Sustainability\nThe focus of process sustainability is to ensure we have the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. In February 2017, we executed an organizational redesign focused on streamlining and simplifying the business, investing in systems and processes to ensure each function has the tools in place to achieve our goals. Recent initiatives include:\nDeveloped a plan to increase capital engineering, plant engineering, and process engineering capabilities that is targeted to enhance food safety, product flow and productivity performance.\nCreated a centralized Consumer Products supply chain team to manage sales and operations planning (\u201cS&OP\u201d), warehousing and distribution.\nLaunched a comprehensive S&OP program to improve supply/demand planning, which is expected to reduce inventory while improving customer service.\nInitiated a program to push centralized cost accounting resources into manufacturing facilities to improve the accuracy of manufacturing-related financial data.\n\u2003\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>42 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGovernance and Management Transitions\nEffective February 6, 2017, David Colo was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of SunOpta. In conjunction with this appointment, Mr. Colo also became a member of the Board. On November 11, 2016, Hendrik Jacobs resigned from his positions as President, CEO, and director. Director Katrina Houde served as interim CEO prior to the appointment of Mr. Colo. Ms. Houde will continue her position on the Board following Mr. Colo's appointment.\nOn October 7, 2016, we increased the size of the Board to nine directors and appointed two Oaktree-nominated independent directors, Dean Hollis and Al Bolles, Ph.D., to the Board. Also on October 7, 2016, Brendan Springstubb was appointed to the Board to replace Douglas Greene who resigned as a director. Mr. Springstubb is a Principal at Engaged Capital LLC, one of our largest shareholders. On October 9, 2016, Alan Murray stepped down from the Board and was replaced as Chair of the Board by Mr. Hollis.\nOn January 19, 2017, Gregg Tanner was appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of director Jay Amato.\nRationalization of Soy and Juice Operations\nOn December 27, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our soy extraction facility in Heuvelton, New York. We determined that our ingredients processing facility in Alexandria, Minnesota, could absorb the production volume from the Heuvelton facility, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Based on the location and use of Heuvelton facility, we recorded an impairment loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, to write down the carrying value of the associated long-lived assets to a nominal salvage value. The closure of the Heuvelton facility occurred on January 10, 2017.\nIn addition, one of our customers intends to move its private label soy- and rice-based aseptic beverage business to another supplier commencing in the second quarter of 2017. This business represented approximately 4% of the revenues from our Consumers Products segment and approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our San Bernardino, California juice facility, after determining that it would be more beneficial to transfer our juice production from the facility to contract manufacturers with whom we have ongoing relationships, rather than make further capital investments in support of the bottling or extraction areas of the facility. These capital investments would have been necessary to satisfy packaging format changes demanded by the facility's largest customer and to address shortfalls in contracting sufficient supply of raw citrus fruit for the upcoming season to allow for effective and efficient use of the facility's extraction capabilities. In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $10.3 million to write down the carrying value of the long-lived assets associated with the facility. The closure of the San Bernardino facility occurred on December 28, 2016. On February 28, 2017, we incurred approximately $3.0 million of additional costs related to the early termination of equipment leases associated with the facility, which will be recognized in other expense in the first quarter of 2017.\nRecall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products produced at our Crookston, Minnesota facility due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. During the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recognized estimated losses of $12.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, related to this recall. Our estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We have general liability and product recall insurance policies with aggregate limits of $47.0 million under which we are expecting to recover recall-related costs, less applicable deductibles. For the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $12.0 million and $39.4 million for the losses recognized to-date related to the recall. However, we may not recover amounts equal to the amount of the losses that have been or may be recognized if those losses exceed the coverage available or are excluded under the insurance policies.\nAs a result of the recall, we have experienced the loss of a number of customers, some of which we believe we can regain once remediation efforts are completed at our sunflower roasting facilities. In addition, we are implementing a series of new food safety and quality processes at these facilities that will require significant capital investment and will have an ongoing impact on the productivity of our roasting operations. Based on an assessment of the effect on future cash flows of lower anticipated sales demand and higher expected production and capital costs, we determined that the impact of the recall on the fair value of our sunflower reporting unit reflected an impairment of the associated goodwill, resulting in a $17.5 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our assessment, however, determined that the carrying values of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of the sunflower reporting unit were recoverable as at December 31, 2016.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>43 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor more information regarding the recall, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSettlement of Plum Dispute\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with Plum, PBC (\u201cPlum\u201d), Campbell Soup Company (\u201cCampbell\u201d), and various other parties. The Settlement Agreement resolved the disputed issues among the parties in connection with the litigation filed by Plum against our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Global Organic Ingredients, Inc. (\u201cSGOI\u201d), which arose out of a voluntary recall by Plum of certain products manufactured at our Allentown, Pennsylvania facility in 2013 (see Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K).\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid Campbell $5.0 million in cash and will provide Campbell with rebates of up to $4.0 million over a four-year period in connection with Plum's purchases of pouch products and Campbell's purchases of aseptic broth products pursuant to manufacturing and supply agreements between the parties and their affiliates. In order for Campbell to obtain the full $4.0 million in rebates, Plum and Campbell must order certain minimum quantities of pouch products and aseptic broth products within each of the designated twelve-month periods over the four-year rebate period. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, we recorded a charge of $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, as we believe there is reasonable assurance that the minimum order quantities will be achieved.\nSale of Opta Minerals\nOn February 11, 2016, Opta Minerals entered into a definitive acquisition agreement, pursuant to which an affiliate of Speyside Equity Fund I LP (\u201cSpeyside\u201d) agreed to acquire substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Opta Minerals. The acquisition of Opta Minerals by Speyside was completed on April 6, 2016, following a vote of the shareholders of Opta Minerals in favor of the transaction on March 31, 2016.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $4.8 million (C$6.2 million), of which $3.2 million (C$4.2 million) was received in cash, with the remainder received in the form of a $1.5 million (C$2.0 million) subordinated promissory note bearing interest at 2.0% per annum that will mature on October 6, 2018. We incurred direct costs related to the sale of Opta Minerals of $0.8 million. The sale of our equity interest in Opta Minerals was consistent with our objective of divesting our non-core assets in order to become a pure-play healthy and organic foods company. We have no significant continuing involvement with Opta Minerals.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a loss on classification of Opta Minerals as a discontinued operation held for sale of $10.5 million, or $7.7 million net of non-controlling interest, to write down the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets to fair value less cost to sell based on estimated net proceeds on sale of approximately $4.5 million as at January 2, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we recognized a $0.6 million gain on classification as held for sale which reflected a $1.1 million decline in the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in the estimated net proceeds on sale. We have not recognized the results of operations or cash flows of Opta Minerals for the period from April 1, 2016 to the closing of the transaction on April 6, 2016, as these amounts were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding the sale of Opta Minerals, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nFive-Year Global Revolving Asset-Based Credit Facility\nOn February 11, 2016, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $350 million, subject to borrowing base capacity (the \u201cGlobal Credit Facility\u201d), as described below under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nAcquisition of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc.\nOn October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunrise Holding (Delaware), Inc. (\u201cSunrise\u201d), pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 30, 2015 (the \u201cSunrise Acquisition\u201d), for total consideration of $472.7 million in cash. Sunrise is a processor of conventional and organic individually quick frozen fruit in the U.S. The acquisition of Sunrise is aligned with our strategic focus on healthy and organic foods. Sunrise has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>44 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2016, we initiated the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition. Consequently, we transferred all production volume from our Buena Park, California facility into Sunrise's facilities located in Kansas and California. In 2016, we recognized severance and rationalization costs of $2.4 million related to closure of the Buena Park facility and associated corporate office located in Cerritos, California.\nAcquisition of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc.\nOn August 11, 2015, we acquired the net operating assets of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc. (\u201cNiagara Natural\u201d), a manufacturer of all-natural fruit snacks. Niagara Natural's operations are located in the Niagara Region of Ontario. The transaction included a cash purchase price of $6.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to approximately $2.8 million based on specific performance targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was determined to be $2.3 million as at the acquisition date. Niagara Natural is a strong strategic fit within our core consumer products strategy and has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Niagara Natural, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered an agreement with the owners of Niagara Natural to settle the contingent consideration obligation in exchange for a one-time cash payment of $0.6 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million in connection with this settlement, based on the difference between the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of $2.3 million as at April 2, 2016 and the cash payment.\nAcquisition of Citrusource, LLC\nOn March 2, 2015, we acquired Citrusource, LLC (\u201cCitrusource\u201d), a producer of premium not-from-concentrate private label organic and conventional orange juice and citrus products in the U.S. We paid $13.3 million in cash at closing and we may pay additional consideration based on the incremental growth in Citrusource's base business. The fair value of the total consideration transferred to acquire Citrusource was $31.7 million as at the acquisition date. The acquisition of Citrusource aligned with our strategy of growing our value-added consumer products portfolio. Citrusource has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Citrusource, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSale of Fiber and Starch Business\nOn December 22, 2014, we completed the sale of our fiber and starch business (the \u201cFiber Business\u201d) for $37.5 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The Fiber Business included five facilities located in Louisville, Kentucky, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Cambridge, Minnesota, Fosston, Minnesota, and Galesburg, Illinois, and was formerly part of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. We continue to operate both our integrated grain- and fruit-based ingredient businesses, which were not part of the sale, and which previously formed the remainder of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. For more information regarding the sale of the Fiber Business, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most significant to our business.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place; price is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Consideration given to customers such as value incentives, rebates, early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>45 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nOur accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers. The carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us. In assessing the amount of reserve required, a number of factors are considered including the age of the account, the credit-worthiness of the customer, payment terms, the customer's historical payment history and general economic conditions. Because the amount of the reserve is an estimate, the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable. Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventory\nInventory is our largest current asset and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, measured on a weighted-average cost basis, or estimated net realizable value except for certain grain inventories that are carried at market value. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. These factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products, and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans, and expected market conditions. As a result, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. We perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis. Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the movements in the inventory reserve.\nIntangible Assets\nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets acquired through business combinations for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, such as the loss of a significant customer; current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, such as the introduction of a competing product that results in a significant loss of market share; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, an intangible asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as a plan to exit a product line or business in the near term.\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. A discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value using estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply. Some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flows, and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, an intangible asset's expected useful life can increase estimation risk, as longer-lived assets necessarily require longer-term cash flow forecasts, which for some of our long-lived assets can be in excess of 20 years. In connection with an impairment evaluation, we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it, as appropriate.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available. To evaluate goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists. Any impairment loss is recognized in earnings.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>46 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically measure the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach). Because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted cash flows include a terminal value. Cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth and our planned business strategies in future periods. Examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility; a reduction of working capital at a specific location; and price increases or cost reductions within a reporting unit. The discount rate is based on a reporting unit's targeted weighted-average cost of capital, which is not necessarily the same as our weighted-average cost of capital. These assumptions are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained. Each year we re-evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment.\nWe perform our annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Based on the results of the quantitative test performed for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million, which reflected the negative impact on future cash flows of the recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d). Our quantitative test for 2016 indicated that a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our other reporting units would not have triggered additional impairment testing. Based on the results of the quantitative tests performed for the years ended January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we determined that none of the goodwill associated with any of our reporting units was impaired in either of those fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.\nThe assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired are among the most significant in our acquisition accounting and generally require the most judgment. Key variables in determining the fair value of customer relationships are the estimated customer attrition rate and the percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers. Changes to either or both of these variables could have a significant impact on the customer relationships intangible assets' values, and changes to the estimated customer attrition rate could have a significant impact on the estimated useful lives of these assets. The expected customer attrition rate assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is generally supported by an analysis of historical attrition of the acquired business's customers and consideration of its amortization policy of previously acquired customer relationships, amortization policies adopted for acquired customer relationships by other companies in similar transactions, and the contractual terms between the acquired business and its customers. The percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is typically supported by an analysis of the acquired business's historical and forecasted revenue growth rates by customer. Changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets could have a significant impact on the amounts assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation. Future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an increase or decrease in amortization expense, or impairment of the intangible assets and/or goodwill. Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note 9 outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles.\nSome acquisitions involve contingent consideration to be potentially paid based on the achievement of specified future financial targets by the acquired business. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially recognized as a liability at estimated fair value and re-measured each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings. These estimates of fair value involve uncertainties as they include assumptions about the likelihood of achieving the specified financial targets, projections of future financial performance, and assumed discount rates. A change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could impact the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities in the purchase price allocation, or the amounts recognized in earnings to reflect subsequent changes in the carrying value of the liability. Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K includes disclosures regarding the estimated fair value of contingent consideration.\nContingencies\nWe make estimates for payments that are contingent on the outcome of uncertain future events. These contingencies include accrued but unpaid bonuses; tax-related matters; and claims or litigation. In establishing our estimates, we consider historical experience with similar contingencies and the progress of each contingency, as well as the recommendations of internal and external advisors and legal counsel. We re-evaluate all contingencies as additional information becomes available; however, given the inherent uncertainties, the ultimate amount paid could differ from our estimates.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>47 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn particular, as discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d, we have recognized estimated losses of $40.0 million related to this recall as at December 31, 2016. These estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We may need to revise these estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims that may be received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are liable for income taxes in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences, investment and other tax credits, the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions, enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year, the benefit of cross-jurisdictional financing structures, changes due to foreign exchange, changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets, and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations.\nIn making an estimate of our income tax liability, we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction. This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes. These differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet. We also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable. This judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts. We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied, the number of years based on management's estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances. If different judgments had been used, our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded. In addition, the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment. Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets.\nWhile we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal, provincial, state and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to selected employees and directors. For grants of stock options, we are required to estimate a number of inputs at each grant date, such as the estimated life of the option, future stock price volatility, and the forfeiture rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non-employee directors. We determine the expected life of a stock option using the simplified method, as we changed the vesting period of our stock option grants from five years to three years in 2016, and the contractual term of our stock option grants from six years to 10 years in 2012 and, as a result, we do not believe historical exercise data provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life. Future stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common shares over the expected life of the stock option. Once determined at the grant date, the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted. Refer to note 14 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for disclosure of the inputs used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation.\nTable 69: <table>

Excluding the impact on revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of business acquisitions and associated product rationalizations (an increase in revenues of approximately $231.0 million), changes in commodity-related pricing and foreign exchange rates (a decrease in revenues of approximately $28.0 million), estimated impact of the recall of certain sunflower kernel products based on shortfall against anticipated volumes (a decrease in revenues of approximately $10.0 million), and estimated impact on west coast pouch operations as a result of a fire at a third-party facility (a decrease in revenues of approximately $5.0 million), revenues increased 1.0% in 2016, compared with 2015. This increase in revenues on an adjusted basis reflected higher demand for organic ingredients and growth in aseptic beverage volumes with the added output from the Allentown facility and new product launches. These positive factors were mostly offset by lower volumes of specialty raw materials driven by a reduction in contracted acres and lower retail market demand for frozen fruit in the fourth quarter of the 2016.\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>51 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues decreased by 6.0% to $297.5 million from $316.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact on revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 of changes in commodity-related pricing and foreign exchange rates (a decrease in revenues of approximately $9.0 million), estimated impact of the recall of certain sunflower kernel products based on shortfall against anticipated volumes (a decrease in revenues of approximately $3.0 million), estimated impact on west coast pouch operations as a result of a fire at a third-party facility (a decrease in revenues of approximately $3.0 million), and business acquisitions and associated product rationalizations (a decrease in revenues of approximately $1.0 million), revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased by 0.9%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease in revenues on an adjusted basis reflected lower volumes of specialty raw materials driven by a reduction in contracted acres, as well as a sharp decline in retail market demand for frozen fruit products. In addition, sales of aseptic beverage products and specialty bars were flat relative to the prior year due to customer turnover and the ramp-up of new product offerings.\nGross profit increased $15.6 million, or 14.1%, to $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $110.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 9.4% compared to 9.6% for the year ended January 2, 2016, a decrease of 0.2% . The gross profit percentage for 2016 would have been approximately 10.9%, excluding the impact of an acquisition accounting adjustment related to Sunrise's inventory sold in 2016 ($15.0 million), aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures mainly on specialty grain varieties we are exiting ($3.4 million), lost margin caused by the recall of certain sunflower kernel products ($1.7 million),\nstart-up costs related to the ramp-up of production at the Allentown aseptic beverage facility ($1.6 million), and an inventory reserve for certain consumer-packaged products due to quality-related issues ($1.2 million). For 2015, the gross profit percentage would also have been approximately 10.9%, excluding the impact of costs related to the retrofit of the San Bernardino juice facility and expansion of the Allentown facility to add aseptic beverage production capabilities ($4.1 million), an acquisition accounting adjustment related to the Sunrise's inventory sold subsequent to the acquisition date ($4.0 million), aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures on certain organic raw materials ($2.4 million), downtime and spoilage caused by equipment failures at the Allentown pouch facility ($2.2 million), and demurrage, detention and other related expenses ($2.0 million). Excluding these items, the year-over-year gross profit percentage on an adjusted basis reflected increased efficiency and lower costs at our aseptic beverage operations and improved pricing spreads on organic ingredients. These positive factors were offset by increased raw material costs for frozen strawberries that could not be passed on immediately to customers, as well as production inefficiencies within our frozen fruit operations in the first half of 2016 caused by a late harvest and the resultant shortage of strawberries. In addition, we experienced lower pricing spreads on specialty corn and soy and reduced throughput in our sunflower roasting operations with the implementation of new food safety and quality processes.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, gross profit decreased $8.2 million, or 32.4%, to $17.0 million, compared with $25.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 5.7% compared to 8.0% for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.3% . The gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been approximately 7.9%, excluding the impact of costs related to aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures mainly on specialty grain varieties we are exiting ($3.4 million), the acquisition accounting adjustment related to Sunrise's inventory sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 ($1.6 million), an inventory reserve for certain consumer-packaged products due to quality-related issues ($1.2 million), and lost margin caused by the recall of certain sunflower kernel products ($0.7 million). For the fourth quarter of 2015, the gross profit percentage would have been 11.3%, excluding the impact of costs related to the acquisition accounting adjustment related to the Sunrise's inventory sold subsequent to the acquisition date ($4.0 million), aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures on certain organic raw materials ($2.4 million), downtime and spoilage caused by equipment failures at the Allentown pouch facility ($2.2 million), the retrofit of the San Bernardino juice facility and expansion of the Allentown aseptic beverage facility ($1.9 million), and demurrage, detention and other related expenses ($0.2 million). Excluding these items, the gross profit percentage decreased 3.4% on an adjusted basis in fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, which was driven mainly by lower production volumes across our consumer products platforms, as well as the reduced throughput in our sunflower roasting operations. In particular, frozen fruit production was impacted by the decline in retail market demand in the fourth quarter of 2016, which also resulted in higher storage costs due to higher inventory carry over. These negative factors were partially offset by improved pricing spreads on organic ingredients.\nTotal segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $6.6 million, or 30.8%, to $14.7 million, compared with $21.3 million for the year ended January 2, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, segment operating income was 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 1.9% for the year ended January 2, 2016. The decrease in segment operating income mainly reflected increases in SG&A expenses and intangible asset amortization, which more than offset the higher overall gross profit as described above. The $12.9 million increase in SG&A expenses, mainly reflected incremental expenses from acquired businesses and external advisory costs associated with the strategic review and Value Creation Plan ($4.0 million), as well as higher litigation-related legal costs mainly related to the Plum dispute ($1.9 million). As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 7.3% in 2016, compared with 7.5% in 2015, a decrease of 0.2% . Excluding the impact of costs related to the strategic review, Value Creation Plan and Plum dispute, SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis as a percentage of revenues would have been approximately 6.8% in 2016, compared with approximately 7.4% in 2015, which reflected efficiencies gained following the Sunrise Acquisition. The year-over-year increase in intangible asset amortization of $6.3 million reflected the incremental amortization of identified intangible assets of acquired businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in segment operating income was a foreign exchange loss of $1.2 million in 2016, compared with a foreign exchange gain of $1.6 million in 2015, mainly reflecting the negative impact of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the peso on our Mexican frozen fruit operations in 2016, compared with the positive impact of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro in 2015.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>52 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, total segment operating loss increased by $8.2 million to $10.0 million, compared with $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the segment operating loss reflected lower overall gross profit as described above, as well as a $1.3 million increase in SG&A expenses, mainly reflecting external advisory costs associated with the strategic review and Value Creation Plan of $3.6 million, partially offset by lower compensation and other administrative costs. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, or approximately 7.4% excluding the impact of costs related to the strategic review and Value Creation Plan, compared with 7.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Partially offsetting the increase in segment operating loss was a $1.2 million increase in foreign exchange gains mainly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the corresponding period of 2015.\nFurther details on revenue, gross profit and segment operating income variances are provided below under \u201cSegmented Operations Information\u201d.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $28.3 million included charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets mainly associated with the closure of the San Bernardino juice facility and the Heuvelton soy facility ($11.5 million), settlement of the Plum dispute ($9.0 million), severance and rationalization costs related to the departure of Mr. Jacobs as President and CEO, certain facility closures, workforce rationalization initiatives and employee retention costs ($3.7 million), costs related to the withdrawal of certain consumer-packaged products and the recall of certain sunflower kernel products ($2.8 million), and the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition ($2.2 million). These charges were partially offset by the $1.7 million gain on settlement of the contingent consideration obligation related to the acquisition of Niagara Natural. Other expense for the year ended January 2, 2016 of $12.2 million included business development costs of $7.8 million, primarily reflecting acquisition- and integration-related costs incurred in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition; as well as severance and other rationalization costs of $2.9 million mainly related to a former CEO.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million related to our sunflower operations (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d).\nThe increase in interest expense of $27.6 million to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $15.7 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, primarily reflected increased costs associated with borrowings to finance the Sunrise Acquisition. Interest expense for 2016 included $9.1 million of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and $2.4 million of other costs incurred in connection with proposed alternative financing arrangements. Interest expense for 2015 included $3.4 million of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and the write-off of $2.0 million of loan commitment fees associated with bridge financing for the Sunrise Acquisition that was not utilized. For 2017, we estimate our cash interest costs will be in the range of $29 million to $32 million.\nWe recognized a recovery of income tax of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (including the realization of $1.3 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits), compared with a recovery of income tax of $3.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2016. Excluding the impact of the change in unrecognized tax benefits, the effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.6% of the loss before income taxes (excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss), compared with 52.0% of loss before income taxes for 2015. The effective tax rates reflected the impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, mainly as the result of pre-tax losses in the U.S. in 2016 and 2015, which reflected the effect of higher cash interest and debt issuance costs related to the financing of the Sunrise Acquisition, costs related to business acquisitions, including the acquisition accounting adjustments to Sunrise inventory sold. In addition, for 2016, pre-tax losses in the U.S. reflected the impairment of assets related to facility closures, and the impact of other discrete items including costs associated with the Plum legal settlement and Value Creation Plan, as well as product withdrawal and recall costs.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>53 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from continuing operations, net of non-controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $50.6 million, compared with a loss of $3.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, an increase of $47.6 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit as a percentage of revenue was impacted by a $15.0 million acquisition accounting adjustment related to Sunrise inventory sold, as well as costs associated with expansion activities at the Allentown aseptic beverage facility ($1.6 million) and an inventory reserve for certain consumer-packaged products due to quality-related issues ($1.2 million). Excluding these costs, the gross profit percentage in Consumer Products would have been 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit percentage on an adjusted basis reflected the higher margin profile of 2015 business acquisitions, and increased facility utilization and operating costs within the beverage operations, partially offset by higher costs within healthy fruit operations due to a delayed 2016 fruit harvest that led to increased labor costs and higher raw material prices that were not immediately built into customer pricing.

The 2016 management fee allocations reflect the additional revenues and head count added as a result of the acquisitions of Sunrise, Citrusource, and Niagara Natural. These acquisitions added approximately $350.0 million in annualized revenues all to the Consumer Products segment.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>58 </td> <td>December 31, 2016

Excluding the impact on revenues of business acquisitions, product rationalizations and other changes (a net increase in revenues of approximately $57.0 million), changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity-related pricing (decreases in revenues of approximately $32.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively), and the impact of the additional week of sales in fiscal 2014 (a decrease in revenues of approximately $21.0 million), revenues increased 4.1% in 2015, compared with 2014. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $316.4 million, an increase of $65.8 million, or 26.3%, compared with revenues of $250.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact on revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 of business acquisitions, product rationalizations and other changes (an increase in revenues of approximately $56.0 million), changes in foreign exchange rates (a decrease in revenues of approximately $6.0 million), and changes in commodity-related pricing (an increase in revenues of approximately $2.0 million), revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by 5.5%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increases in revenue on an adjusted basis for the full year and fourth quarter of 2015, compared with the corresponding periods of 2014, reflected stronger demand for organic ingredients in the U.S. and Europe, offset by lower sunflower and grain-based ingredient volumes and lower volumes for consumer-based aseptic beverage and frozen food retail products.\nGross profit decreased $11.7 million, or 9.6%, to $110.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with $122.1 million for the year ended January 3, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit for the year ended January 2, 2016 was 9.6% compared to 11.1% for the year ended January 3, 2015, a decrease of 1.4% . The gross profit percentage for 2015 would have been approximately 10.9%, excluding the impact of costs related to the retrofit of the San Bernardino juice facility and expansion of the Allentown facility to add aseptic beverage production capabilities ($4.1 million), acquisition accounting adjustment related to the Sunrise's inventory sold subsequent to the acquisition date ($4.0 million), aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures on certain organic raw materials ($2.4 million), downtime and spoilage caused by equipment failures at the Allentown pouch facility ($2.2 million), and demurrage, detention and other related expenses ($2.0 million). The 0.2% decline in gross profit percentage year-over-year on an adjusted basis mainly reflected lower capacity utilization and a higher cost base within consumer-based product categories due to recent expansion activities, partially offset by improved performance in our rationalized sunflower operations and increased margin contribution from higher volumes of organic ingredients.\nTotal segment operating income for the year ended January 2, 2016 decreased by $20.4 million, or 48.9%, to $21.3 million, compared with $41.7 million for the year ended January 3, 2015. As a percentage of revenue, segment operating income was 1.9% for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with 3.8% for the year ended January 3, 2015. The decrease in segment operating income reflected lower overall gross profit as described above and a $5.4 million increase in SG&A expenses, reflecting incremental expenses from acquired businesses and higher litigation-related legal costs mainly related to the Plum dispute. Those factors were partially offset by lower employee short-term and long-term incentives tied to operating performance, controlled discretionary spending, and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on SG&A expenses denominated in Canadian dollars and euros. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 7.5% in 2015 and, excluding the impact of higher litigation costs of $2.0 million, and lower stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million, SG&A expenses would have been approximately 7.4% on an adjusted basis, which is in-line with our intention of maintaining SG&A below 8% of revenues.\nIntangible asset amortization increased $2.9 million year-over-year in 2015, related to the identified intangible assets of acquired businesses.\nWe recognized foreign exchange gains of $1.6 million and $2.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, respectively, mainly related to the positive impact of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro on open foreign exchange contracts within our international sourcing and supply operations.\nFurther details on revenue, gross profit and segment operating income variances are provided below under \u201cSegmented Operations Information\u201d.\nOther expense for the year ended January 2, 2016 of $12.2 million included business development costs of $7.8 million, primarily reflecting acquisition- and integration-related costs incurred in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition, as well as severance and other rationalization costs of $2.9 million mainly related to a former CEO. Other income for the year ended January 3, 2015 of $2.2 million included a net gain on sale of assets of $1.4 million primarily related to the disposal of certain of our sunflower production and storage facilities in order to reduce the cost structure and improve the production capacity utilization within our North American sunflower operations, partially offset by severance costs for employees affected by the closure and sale of the sunflower facilities, and a gain of $1.4 million on the settlement of a contingent consideration arrangement.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>61 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest expense of $11.7 million to $15.7 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with $3.9 million for the year ended January 3, 2015, primarily reflected increased costs associated with borrowings to finance the Sunrise Acquisition, which included $3.4 million of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and the write-off of $2.0 million of loan commitment fees associated with bridge financing for the Sunrise Acquisition that was not utilized.\nIn 2014, we recognized an impairment loss of $8.4 million related to our non-core investment in Enchi, a developer of advanced bioconversion products for the renewable fuels industry.\nThe recovery of income tax for the year ended January 2, 2016 was $3.4 million, or 52.0% of loss before taxes, compared with a provision for income taxes $12.0 million, or 30.1% of earnings before taxes, for the year ended January 3, 2015 (excluding the non-deductible impairment loss on investment in 2014, for which the related deferred tax asset is considered more likely than not to be unrealized). The increase in the effective tax rate in 2015, compared with 2014, reflected the impact of pre-tax losses in the U.S., due to a combination of acquisition-related costs primarily related to the Sunrise Acquisition and lower pre-tax earnings within our U.S.-based consumer products operations, which more than offset taxable income in our European and Canadian operations.\nLoss from continuing operations, net of non-controlling interests, for the year ended January 2, 2016 was $3.0 million, compared with earnings of $19.3 million for the year ended January 3, 2015, a decrease of $22.3 million. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.04 for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.28 for the year ended January 3, 2015.\nLoss from discontinued operations of $19.5 million for the year ended January 2, 2016 primarily reflected the results of Opta Minerals, including an asset impairment charge of $12.4 million and loss on classification as held for sale of $10.5 million, net of non-controlling interest of $8.8 million. Loss from discontinued operations of $8.1 million for the year ended January 3, 2015 primarily reflected the results of Opta Minerals, including asset impairment and plant closure costs of $4.2 million and a goodwill impairment loss of $11.0 million, net of non-controlling interest of $5.2 million. In addition, we recognized a gain on the sale of the Fiber Business, net of income taxes, of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOn a consolidated basis, we realized a loss of $22.5 million (diluted loss per share of $0.31) for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with earnings of $13.1 million (diluted earnings per share of $0.19) for the year ended January 3, 2015.\nFor the year ended January 2, 2016, adjusted earnings were $17.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $26.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the year ended January 3, 2015.

The Global Credit Facility will be used to support the working capital and general corporate needs of our global operations, in addition to funding future strategic initiatives. In addition, subject to customary borrowing conditions and the agreement of any such lenders to provide such increased commitments, we may request to increase the total lending commitments under this facility to a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $450.0 million. The applicable margin in the Global Credit Facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for loans bearing interest based on LIBOR and from 0.25% to 0.75% for loans bearing interest based on the prime rate and, in each case, is set quarterly based on average borrowing availability for the preceding fiscal quarter. As at December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $199.3 million and approximately $100.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. For more information on the Global Credit Facility, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nOn October 9, 2015, SunOpta Foods and certain of our other subsidiaries entered into the Second Lien Loan Agreement with a group of lenders, pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $330.0 million of term loans (the \u201cInitial Loans\u201d). The net proceeds of the Second Lien Loan Agreement were used to partially fund the Sunrise Acquisition. As at October 1, 2016, we had repaid $20.0 million of the outstanding principal of the Initial Loans. On October 7, 2016, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock to repay an additional $79.0 million principal amount of the Initial Loans. The remaining $231.0 million aggregate principal amount of Initial Loans matured on October 9, 2016 and automatically converted into a like principal amount of term loans (such converted loans, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d), with a maturity date of October 9, 2022. The Term Loans bore interest at 9.5% per annum. On October 20, 2016, all of the outstanding Term Loans were exchanged for a corresponding amount of 9.5% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due October 9, 2022 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) issued by SunOpta Foods. For more information on the Notes, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. The Second Lien Loan Agreement was terminated in connection with the issuance of the Notes.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>66 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have an effective registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to which we may offer up to $200.0 million of debt, equity and other securities. We also have a prospectus on file with Canadian securities regulators covering the offer and sale of up to $200.0 million of debt, equity and other securities. On September 30, 2015, we issued 16.7 million of our common shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million under the U.S. registration statement and the Canadian prospectus. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to partially fund the Sunrise Acquisition. The remaining amount of $100.0 million available under U.S. registration statement and the Canadian prospectus could be used by us for a public offering of debt, equity or other securities to raise additional capital. Our ability to conduct any such future offerings will be subject to market conditions. The U.S. registration statement will expire in August 2017.\nIn order to finance significant acquisitions, if any, that may arise in the future, we may need additional sources of cash that we could attempt to obtain through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing, a private or public offering of debt or equity securities, or the issuance of common stock as consideration in an acquisition. There can be no assurance that these types of financing would be available at all or, if so, on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIn the event that we require additional liquidity due to market conditions, unexpected actions by our lenders, changes to our growth strategy, or other factors, our ability to obtain any additional financing on favourable terms, if at all, could be limited.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nNet cash and cash equivalents related to continuing operations decreased $1.0 million to $1.3 million as at December 31, 2016, compared with $2.3 million at January 2, 2016, which primarily reflected the following uses of cash:\nrepayment of borrowings of $320.0 million under the Second Lien Loan Agreement;\ncapital expenditures of $22.6 million, mainly related to the automation of frozen fruit processing and to food safety and quality initiatives in connection with the Value Creation Plan; and\npayment of $13.0 million of debt issuance costs related to the Notes and Global Credit Facility.\nThese uses of cash were mostly offset by the following sources of cash:\ngross proceeds of $231.0 million on the issuance of the Notes;\nnet proceeds of $79.0 million on the issuance of the Preferred Stock; and\nnet borrowings of $44.3 million under our line of credit facilities.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, a decrease in cash provided of $25.7 million, which reflected lower year-over-year operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in reduced inventory turnover, partially offset by the receipt of income tax refunds during 2016 related to 2015.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $521.6 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, a decrease in cash used of $500.0 million, which mainly reflected total cash paid of $490.7 million in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition, as well as upfront payments for Niagara Natural and Citrusource in 2015. In addition, capital expenditures declined year-over-year by $8.6 million, reflecting higher spending in 2015 related to a retrofit of the San Bernardino juice facility and the expansion of the Allentown aseptic beverage facility. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2016 reflected cash proceeds from the sale of Opta Minerals of $3.2 million, net of cash sold.\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with cash provided of $490.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, a decrease in cash provided of $473.2 million, which mainly reflected debt and equity issuances in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition in 2015 for proceeds of $408.1 million in the aggregate, net of issuance costs. In addition, net borrowings under our line of credit facilities decreased $41.7 million in 2016, compared with 2015, reflecting borrowings of $79.2 million to finance a portion of the Sunrise Acquisition and upfront payments for Niagara Natural and Citrusource in 2015, partially offset by the payment of $13.0 million of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Notes and Global Credit Facility, and repayment of $10.0 million of borrowings under the Second Lien Loan Agreement and in 2016. In addition, we repaid the remaining $310.0 million outstanding under the Second Lien Loan Agreement with gross proceeds of $231.0 million from the issuance of the Notes and net proceeds of $79.0 million from the issuance of the Preferred Stock. In 2016, we also repaid in full outstanding borrowings of $192.7 million under our North American and European credit facilities with new borrowings under the Global Credit Facility.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>67 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet cash and cash equivalents related to continuing operations decreased $5.5 million to $2.3 million as at January 2, 2016, compared with $7.8 million at January 3, 2015, which primarily reflected the following uses of cash:\ncash paid in connection with business acquisitions of $490.7 million in the aggregate;\ncapital expenditures of $31.2 million, which included $11.5 million of maintenance capital expenditures, as well as strategic spending related to the retrofit of the San Bernardino juice facility and expansion of the Allentown facility;\nfinancing costs incurred primarily in connection with the Second Lien Loan Agreement of $16.0 million; and\nrepayments of long-term debt of $11.0 million, primarily related to the repayment of $10.0 million of borrowings under the Second Lien Loan Agreement.\nThese uses of cash were mostly offset by the following sources of cash:\nborrowings of $330.0 million under the Second Lien Loan Agreement in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition;\nnet proceeds from the issuance of common shares of $94.1 million in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition;\nnet borrowings under our credit facilities of $86.0 million, mainly in connection with business acquisitions;\ncash provided by continuing operating activities of $26.4 million; and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of $7.8 million in the aggregate.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with $17.5 million for the year ended January 3, 2015, an increase of $8.9 million, reflecting strong working capital cash inflows and incremental cash flows from acquired businesses, partially offset by a decline in the year-over-year operating performance within our existing consumer products operations. Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $4.8 million and $7.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflected the operations of Opta Minerals and the Fiber Business.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations increased by $509.9 million to $521.6 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with $11.7 million for the year ended January 3, 2015, mainly due to the total cash paid of $490.7 million in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition, as well as the upfront payments for Niagara Natural and Citrusource. In addition, capital expenditures increased $13.5 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of aseptic processing and packaging capabilities at the Allentown facility. In 2014, we received cash proceeds of $5.8 million from the sale of the sunflower facilities. Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations of $34.5 million in 2014 primarily reflected the net proceeds from the sale of the Fiber Business of $36.9 million.\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $490.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2016, compared with cash used of $39.4 million for the year ended January 3, 2015, an increase in cash provided of $529.4 million, which mainly reflected the debt and equity issuances in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition for proceeds of $408.1 million in the aggregate, net of issuance costs. In addition, borrowings under our credit facilities increased $126.9 million year-over-year, including $59.2 million to finance a portion of the Sunrise Acquisition and $20.0 million to fund the Niagara Natural and Citrusource upfront payments. In addition, the year-over-year increase in credit facility borrowings reflected the higher capital spending in 2015, compared with 2014; repayment of $10.0 million of borrowings under the Second Lien Loan Agreement; and proceeds from the sale of the Fiber Business in 2014, which did not similarly occur in 2015, partially offset by increased operating cash flows and higher proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants in 2015, compared with 2014.\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>68 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff - Balance Sheet

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Financial Information\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) section provides analysis of our operations and financial position for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and includes information available to March 2, 2017, unless otherwise indicated herein.

Healthy Beverages includes aseptic packaged products including non-dairy and dairy beverages, broths and teas; refrigerated premium juices; and shelf-stable juices and functional waters. Healthy Fruit includes individually quick frozen (\u201cIQF\u201d) fruits for retail; IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice; and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. Healthy Snacks includes fruit snacks; nutritional and protein bars; and resealable pouch products.\nFor a more detailed description of our operating groups and their businesses, please see the \u201cBusiness\u201d section at Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a fiscal calendar that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were each 52-week periods ending on December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, whereas fiscal year 2014 was a 53-week period ending on January 3, 2015. Except as otherwise noted in this MD&A, the impact of the additional week on our results of operations for fiscal year 2014 was insignificant relative to the fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\n\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review\nOn June 27, 2016, we announced that we had engaged external financial and legal advisors to review our operating plan and to evaluate a range of strategic and financial actions that we could undertake to maximize shareholder value. The strategic review arose out of discussions with our largest shareholders, some of which had advocated that we examine value maximization strategies. We also announced that we had engaged a global executive search firm to assist in identifying candidates who could add additional operating, industry and capital markets experience and expertise to our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The strategic review was concluded on October 7, 2016 with our announcement of a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, \u201cOaktree\u201d).\nOn October 7, 2016, Oaktree invested $85.0 million in cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (\u201cSunOpta Foods\u201d). The shares of Preferred Stock are exchangeable into common shares of SunOpta Inc. in accordance with certain terms and conditions. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock were used to repay $79.0 million of borrowings made under our second lien loan agreement.\nValue Creation Plan\nWe are conducting, with the assistance of Oaktree, a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Through this review, management and the Board have developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The statements we make below about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including expected improvements in earnings, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), working capital efficiencies, and expected cash flows, are forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including debt service and capital expenditures.\nWe are currently targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized EBITDA enhancements and $20 million of working capital efficiencies, to be implemented over the coming 12 to 18 months. In the near-term, these benefits are expected to be offset by structural investments we are making in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources. Additionally, during 2017 we anticipate incurring non-structural third-party consulting support, severance, and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, we expect these investments to yield additional improvement in EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. Recent progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below.\nPortfolio Optimization\nThe focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where we are not effectively positioned. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the closing of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility, which is expected to be $4 million accretive to EBITDA in 2017. Following that initial announcement, we continued to evaluate our portfolio which resulted in the following additional actions:\n\nClosure of our soy extraction (ingredient) facility in Heuvelton, New York, transferring production to our Alexandria, Minnesota facility.\nExited certain varieties of specialty soy and sunflower, as well as frozen edamame.\nExited a non-core vegetable brokerage operation.\nLaunched a global organic ingredients portfolio strategy review, which is identifying incremental large ingredient categories for further investment. The incremental growth opportunities include new geographies, new products and new processing capabilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 million associated with the Heuvelton facility closure, and $3.4 million of inventory and other reserves to reflect the exit of non-core business lines. We intend to continue to proactively manage our business portfolio to identify opportunities to drive EBITDA growth.\nOperational Excellence\nThe focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. These efforts are expected to generate productivity improvements in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. With the assistance of third-party consulting support, we have identified a number of broad-based savings opportunities to be implemented and realized over 2017 and 2018. Recent activities include:\nLaunched network-wide upgrades to worker safety and food quality programs, with the goal of becoming the leader in safety and quality across the healthy food industry.\nLaunched a productivity enhancement program that is systematically evaluating all manufacturing facilities, supply chain, and procurement processes to identify productivity cost savings. As a result of these efforts, we are targeting $30 million in annualized EBITDA improvements to be implemented over the next 12 to 18 months.\nRolled out the \u201cSunOpta Plant Management System\u201d, which consists of a standardized set of operating processes, key performance indicators, and continuous improvement methodologies that will provide improved consistency and productivity performance across the manufacturing network.\nLaunched a working capital optimization program that is targeting $20 million of cash flow enhancements.\nGo-to-Market Effectiveness\nThe focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. We expect efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Early in 2017, we re-aligned our go-to-market approach, hiring key talent to lead foodservice and retail sales, as well as adding new marketing resources. We also launched a sales force effectiveness program that has already started to generate results. Recent highlights include:\nHired a new Senior Vice President of Foodservice Sales and a Senior Vice President of Beverages and Snacks.\nSecured new business wins in Healthy Beverage, Healthy Fruit and Global Ingredients.\nSelectively adjusted pricing to enhance margins.\nProcess Sustainability\nThe focus of process sustainability is to ensure we have the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. In February 2017, we executed an organizational redesign focused on streamlining and simplifying the business, investing in systems and processes to ensure each function has the tools in place to achieve our goals. Recent initiatives include:\nDeveloped a plan to increase capital engineering, plant engineering, and process engineering capabilities that is targeted to enhance food safety, product flow and productivity performance.\nCreated a centralized Consumer Products supply chain team to manage sales and operations planning (\u201cS&OP\u201d), warehousing and distribution.\nLaunched a comprehensive S&OP program to improve supply/demand planning, which is expected to reduce inventory while improving customer service.\nInitiated a program to push centralized cost accounting resources into manufacturing facilities to improve the accuracy of manufacturing-related financial data.\n\u2003\n\nGovernance and Management Transitions\nEffective February 6, 2017, David Colo was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of SunOpta. In conjunction with this appointment, Mr. Colo also became a member of the Board. On November 11, 2016, Hendrik Jacobs resigned from his positions as President, CEO, and director. Director Katrina Houde served as interim CEO prior to the appointment of Mr. Colo. Ms. Houde will continue her position on the Board following Mr. Colo's appointment.\nOn October 7, 2016, we increased the size of the Board to nine directors and appointed two Oaktree-nominated independent directors, Dean Hollis and Al Bolles, Ph.D., to the Board. Also on October 7, 2016, Brendan Springstubb was appointed to the Board to replace Douglas Greene who resigned as a director. Mr. Springstubb is a Principal at Engaged Capital LLC, one of our largest shareholders. On October 9, 2016, Alan Murray stepped down from the Board and was replaced as Chair of the Board by Mr. Hollis.\nOn January 19, 2017, Gregg Tanner was appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of director Jay Amato.\nRationalization of Soy and Juice Operations\nOn December 27, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our soy extraction facility in Heuvelton, New York. We determined that our ingredients processing facility in Alexandria, Minnesota, could absorb the production volume from the Heuvelton facility, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Based on the location and use of Heuvelton facility, we recorded an impairment loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, to write down the carrying value of the associated long-lived assets to a nominal salvage value. The closure of the Heuvelton facility occurred on January 10, 2017.\nIn addition, one of our customers intends to move its private label soy- and rice-based aseptic beverage business to another supplier commencing in the second quarter of 2017. This business represented approximately 4% of the revenues from our Consumers Products segment and approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our San Bernardino, California juice facility, after determining that it would be more beneficial to transfer our juice production from the facility to contract manufacturers with whom we have ongoing relationships, rather than make further capital investments in support of the bottling or extraction areas of the facility. These capital investments would have been necessary to satisfy packaging format changes demanded by the facility's largest customer and to address shortfalls in contracting sufficient supply of raw citrus fruit for the upcoming season to allow for effective and efficient use of the facility's extraction capabilities. In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $10.3 million to write down the carrying value of the long-lived assets associated with the facility. The closure of the San Bernardino facility occurred on December 28, 2016. On February 28, 2017, we incurred approximately $3.0 million of additional costs related to the early termination of equipment leases associated with the facility, which will be recognized in other expense in the first quarter of 2017.\nRecall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products produced at our Crookston, Minnesota facility due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. During the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recognized estimated losses of $12.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, related to this recall. Our estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We have general liability and product recall insurance policies with aggregate limits of $47.0 million under which we are expecting to recover recall-related costs, less applicable deductibles. For the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $12.0 million and $39.4 million for the losses recognized to-date related to the recall. However, we may not recover amounts equal to the amount of the losses that have been or may be recognized if those losses exceed the coverage available or are excluded under the insurance policies.\nAs a result of the recall, we have experienced the loss of a number of customers, some of which we believe we can regain once remediation efforts are completed at our sunflower roasting facilities. In addition, we are implementing a series of new food safety and quality processes at these facilities that will require significant capital investment and will have an ongoing impact on the productivity of our roasting operations. Based on an assessment of the effect on future cash flows of lower anticipated sales demand and higher expected production and capital costs, we determined that the impact of the recall on the fair value of our sunflower reporting unit reflected an impairment of the associated goodwill, resulting in a $17.5 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our assessment, however, determined that the carrying values of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of the sunflower reporting unit were recoverable as at December 31, 2016.\n\nFor more information regarding the recall, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSettlement of Plum Dispute\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with Plum, PBC (\u201cPlum\u201d), Campbell Soup Company (\u201cCampbell\u201d), and various other parties. The Settlement Agreement resolved the disputed issues among the parties in connection with the litigation filed by Plum against our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Global Organic Ingredients, Inc. (\u201cSGOI\u201d), which arose out of a voluntary recall by Plum of certain products manufactured at our Allentown, Pennsylvania facility in 2013 (see Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K).\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid Campbell $5.0 million in cash and will provide Campbell with rebates of up to $4.0 million over a four-year period in connection with Plum's purchases of pouch products and Campbell's purchases of aseptic broth products pursuant to manufacturing and supply agreements between the parties and their affiliates. In order for Campbell to obtain the full $4.0 million in rebates, Plum and Campbell must order certain minimum quantities of pouch products and aseptic broth products within each of the designated twelve-month periods over the four-year rebate period. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, we recorded a charge of $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, as we believe there is reasonable assurance that the minimum order quantities will be achieved.\nSale of Opta Minerals\nOn February 11, 2016, Opta Minerals entered into a definitive acquisition agreement, pursuant to which an affiliate of Speyside Equity Fund I LP (\u201cSpeyside\u201d) agreed to acquire substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Opta Minerals. The acquisition of Opta Minerals by Speyside was completed on April 6, 2016, following a vote of the shareholders of Opta Minerals in favor of the transaction on March 31, 2016.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $4.8 million (C$6.2 million), of which $3.2 million (C$4.2 million) was received in cash, with the remainder received in the form of a $1.5 million (C$2.0 million) subordinated promissory note bearing interest at 2.0% per annum that will mature on October 6, 2018. We incurred direct costs related to the sale of Opta Minerals of $0.8 million. The sale of our equity interest in Opta Minerals was consistent with our objective of divesting our non-core assets in order to become a pure-play healthy and organic foods company. We have no significant continuing involvement with Opta Minerals.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a loss on classification of Opta Minerals as a discontinued operation held for sale of $10.5 million, or $7.7 million net of non-controlling interest, to write down the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets to fair value less cost to sell based on estimated net proceeds on sale of approximately $4.5 million as at January 2, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we recognized a $0.6 million gain on classification as held for sale which reflected a $1.1 million decline in the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in the estimated net proceeds on sale. We have not recognized the results of operations or cash flows of Opta Minerals for the period from April 1, 2016 to the closing of the transaction on April 6, 2016, as these amounts were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding the sale of Opta Minerals, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nFive-Year Global Revolving Asset-Based Credit Facility\nOn February 11, 2016, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $350 million, subject to borrowing base capacity (the \u201cGlobal Credit Facility\u201d), as described below under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nAcquisition of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc.\nOn October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunrise Holding (Delaware), Inc. (\u201cSunrise\u201d), pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 30, 2015 (the \u201cSunrise Acquisition\u201d), for total consideration of $472.7 million in cash. Sunrise is a processor of conventional and organic individually quick frozen fruit in the U.S. The acquisition of Sunrise is aligned with our strategic focus on healthy and organic foods. Sunrise has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn January 2016, we initiated the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition. Consequently, we transferred all production volume from our Buena Park, California facility into Sunrise's facilities located in Kansas and California. In 2016, we recognized severance and rationalization costs of $2.4 million related to closure of the Buena Park facility and associated corporate office located in Cerritos, California.\nAcquisition of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc.\nOn August 11, 2015, we acquired the net operating assets of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc. (\u201cNiagara Natural\u201d), a manufacturer of all-natural fruit snacks. Niagara Natural's operations are located in the Niagara Region of Ontario. The transaction included a cash purchase price of $6.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to approximately $2.8 million based on specific performance targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was determined to be $2.3 million as at the acquisition date. Niagara Natural is a strong strategic fit within our core consumer products strategy and has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Niagara Natural, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered an agreement with the owners of Niagara Natural to settle the contingent consideration obligation in exchange for a one-time cash payment of $0.6 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million in connection with this settlement, based on the difference between the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of $2.3 million as at April 2, 2016 and the cash payment.\nAcquisition of Citrusource, LLC\nOn March 2, 2015, we acquired Citrusource, LLC (\u201cCitrusource\u201d), a producer of premium not-from-concentrate private label organic and conventional orange juice and citrus products in the U.S. We paid $13.3 million in cash at closing and we may pay additional consideration based on the incremental growth in Citrusource's base business. The fair value of the total consideration transferred to acquire Citrusource was $31.7 million as at the acquisition date. The acquisition of Citrusource aligned with our strategy of growing our value-added consumer products portfolio. Citrusource has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Citrusource, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSale of Fiber and Starch Business\nOn December 22, 2014, we completed the sale of our fiber and starch business (the \u201cFiber Business\u201d) for $37.5 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The Fiber Business included five facilities located in Louisville, Kentucky, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Cambridge, Minnesota, Fosston, Minnesota, and Galesburg, Illinois, and was formerly part of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. We continue to operate both our integrated grain- and fruit-based ingredient businesses, which were not part of the sale, and which previously formed the remainder of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. For more information regarding the sale of the Fiber Business, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most significant to our business.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place; price is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Consideration given to customers such as value incentives, rebates, early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale.\n\nAccounts Receivable\nOur accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers. The carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us. In assessing the amount of reserve required, a number of factors are considered including the age of the account, the credit-worthiness of the customer, payment terms, the customer's historical payment history and general economic conditions. Because the amount of the reserve is an estimate, the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable. Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventory\nInventory is our largest current asset and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, measured on a weighted-average cost basis, or estimated net realizable value except for certain grain inventories that are carried at market value. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. These factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products, and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans, and expected market conditions. As a result, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. We perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis. Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the movements in the inventory reserve.\nIntangible Assets\nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets acquired through business combinations for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, such as the loss of a significant customer; current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, such as the introduction of a competing product that results in a significant loss of market share; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, an intangible asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as a plan to exit a product line or business in the near term.\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. A discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value using estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply. Some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flows, and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, an intangible asset's expected useful life can increase estimation risk, as longer-lived assets necessarily require longer-term cash flow forecasts, which for some of our long-lived assets can be in excess of 20 years. In connection with an impairment evaluation, we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it, as appropriate.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available. To evaluate goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists. Any impairment loss is recognized in earnings.\n\nWe typically measure the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach). Because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted cash flows include a terminal value. Cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth and our planned business strategies in future periods. Examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility; a reduction of working capital at a specific location; and price increases or cost reductions within a reporting unit. The discount rate is based on a reporting unit's targeted weighted-average cost of capital, which is not necessarily the same as our weighted-average cost of capital. These assumptions are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained. Each year we re-evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment.\nWe perform our annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Based on the results of the quantitative test performed for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million, which reflected the negative impact on future cash flows of the recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d). Our quantitative test for 2016 indicated that a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our other reporting units would not have triggered additional impairment testing. Based on the results of the quantitative tests performed for the years ended January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we determined that none of the goodwill associated with any of our reporting units was impaired in either of those fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.\nThe assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired are among the most significant in our acquisition accounting and generally require the most judgment. Key variables in determining the fair value of customer relationships are the estimated customer attrition rate and the percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers. Changes to either or both of these variables could have a significant impact on the customer relationships intangible assets' values, and changes to the estimated customer attrition rate could have a significant impact on the estimated useful lives of these assets. The expected customer attrition rate assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is generally supported by an analysis of historical attrition of the acquired business's customers and consideration of its amortization policy of previously acquired customer relationships, amortization policies adopted for acquired customer relationships by other companies in similar transactions, and the contractual terms between the acquired business and its customers. The percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is typically supported by an analysis of the acquired business's historical and forecasted revenue growth rates by customer. Changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets could have a significant impact on the amounts assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation. Future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an increase or decrease in amortization expense, or impairment of the intangible assets and/or goodwill. Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note 9 outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles.\nSome acquisitions involve contingent consideration to be potentially paid based on the achievement of specified future financial targets by the acquired business. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially recognized as a liability at estimated fair value and re-measured each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings. These estimates of fair value involve uncertainties as they include assumptions about the likelihood of achieving the specified financial targets, projections of future financial performance, and assumed discount rates. A change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could impact the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities in the purchase price allocation, or the amounts recognized in earnings to reflect subsequent changes in the carrying value of the liability. Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K includes disclosures regarding the estimated fair value of contingent consideration.\nContingencies\nWe make estimates for payments that are contingent on the outcome of uncertain future events. These contingencies include accrued but unpaid bonuses; tax-related matters; and claims or litigation. In establishing our estimates, we consider historical experience with similar contingencies and the progress of each contingency, as well as the recommendations of internal and external advisors and legal counsel. We re-evaluate all contingencies as additional information becomes available; however, given the inherent uncertainties, the ultimate amount paid could differ from our estimates.\n\nIn particular, as discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d, we have recognized estimated losses of $40.0 million related to this recall as at December 31, 2016. These estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We may need to revise these estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims that may be received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are liable for income taxes in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences, investment and other tax credits, the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions, enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year, the benefit of cross-jurisdictional financing structures, changes due to foreign exchange, changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets, and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations.\nIn making an estimate of our income tax liability, we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction. This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes. These differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet. We also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable. This judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts. We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied, the number of years based on management's estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances. If different judgments had been used, our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded. In addition, the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment. Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets.\nWhile we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal, provincial, state and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to selected employees and directors. For grants of stock options, we are required to estimate a number of inputs at each grant date, such as the estimated life of the option, future stock price volatility, and the forfeiture rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non-employee directors. We determine the expected life of a stock option using the simplified method, as we changed the vesting period of our stock option grants from five years to three years in 2016, and the contractual term of our stock option grants from six years to 10 years in 2012 and, as a result, we do not believe historical exercise data provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life. Future stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common shares over the expected life of the stock option. Once determined at the grant date, the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted. Refer to note 14 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for disclosure of the inputs used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation.\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2016 and\n\n (1) When assessing the financial performance of our operating segments, we use an internal measure of operating income that excludes other income/expense items and goodwill impairments determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is the basis on which management, including the CEO, assesses the underlying performance of our operating segments. We believe that disclosing this non-GAAP measure assists investors in comparing financial performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core operating performance. However, the non-GAAP measure of operating income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of \u201csegment operating income (loss)\u201d to \u201cearnings (loss) from continuing operations before the following\u201d, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. \n\n\nWe believe that investors' understanding of our financial performance is enhanced by disclosing the specific items that we exclude from segment operating income. However, any measure of operating income excluding any or all of these items is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for operating income prepared under U.S. GAAP. These items are presented solely to allow investors to more fully understand how we assess financial performance.\n (2) When assessing our financial performance, we use an internal measure of earnings from continuing operations, net of non-controlling interests, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP that includes dividends and accretion on convertible preferred stock and excludes specific items recognized in other income/expense, impairment losses on goodwill, long-lived assets and investments, other unusual items that are identified and evaluated on an individual basis, which due to their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We believe that the identification of these excluded items enhances an analysis of our financial performance of our core business when comparing those operating results between periods, as we do not consider these items to be reflective of normal core business operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of \u201cadjusted earnings\u201d from \u201closs from continuing operations\u201d, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. \n\n (a) Reflects costs related to business combinations, including an acquisition accounting adjustment related to Sunrise's inventory sold during the year of $15.0 million, which is recorded in cost of goods sold; the non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the financing related to the Sunrise Acquisition of $7.8 million, as well as $2.6 million of additional debt issuance costs expensed, which are recorded in interest expense; and $2.4 million of integration costs related to the closure and consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition, which are recorded in cost of goods sold and other expense. \n\n (b) Reflects an impairment charge to write off the goodwill associated with the sunflower reporting unit (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d). (c) Reflects an impairment of long-lived assets associated with the closure of the Heuvelton soy extraction facility and the San Bernardino juice facility (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Rationalization of Soy and Juice Operations\u201d). (d) Reflects the charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the Plum dispute (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Settlement of Plum Dispute\u201d), which is recorded in other expense. Also includes $1.6 million (2015 - $1.7 million) of litigation-related legal costs mainly associated with the Plum dispute, which are recorded in SG&A expenses. (e) Reflects voluntary product withdrawal or recall costs of $5.7 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, related to the withdrawal of certain consumer-packaged products for quality-related issues and the recall of certain sunflower kernel products (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d), of which $1.2 million is recorded in cost of goods sold and $2.8 million is recorded in other expense. Also includes a $1.7 million adjustment for the estimated lost margin caused by the sunflower recall, which reflects a shortfall in revenues against anticipated volumes of approximately $9.8 million, less associated cost of goods sold of approximately $8.1 million. (f) Reflects legal and other professional advisory costs associated with the strategic review and execution of the Value Creation Plan, which are recorded in SG&A expenses. (g) Reflects contractual severance benefits of $1.5 million and previously unrecognized stock-based compensation of $0.2 million recognized in connection with the departure of Mr. Jacobs as President and CEO. Also includes employee severance costs of $1.6 million incurred in connection with certain facility closures and workforce rationalization initiatives and employee retention costs of $0.3 million, which are recorded in other expense. (h) Reflects aging reserves and low margin sales to reduce inventory exposures mainly related to certain grain varieties that we are exiting, which are recorded in cost of goods sold. (i) Plant start-up costs relate to the ramp-up of production at the Allentown facility following the completion of the addition of aseptic beverage processing and filling capabilities in the fourth quarter of 2015, which are recorded in cost of goods sold. These start-up costs reflect the negative gross profit reported by the facility as the facility ramped up to break-even production levels. (j) Reflects the write-off to interest expense of $0.2 million of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to our North American credit facilities, which were replaced by the Global Credit Facility. (k) Other includes fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration arrangements and gain/loss on sale of assets, which are recorded in other expense. (l) Reflects the gain on settlement of the contingent consideration obligation related to Niagara Natural (as described above under \u201cRecent Development - Niagara Natural), which is recorded in other income. (m) Reflects the tax effect of the preceding adjustments to earnings and reflects an overall estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 30% on adjusted earnings before tax. (n) Reflects the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. (o) Reflects costs related to business combinations, including an acquisition accounting adjustment related to Sunrise's inventory sold subsequent to the acquisition date of $4.0 million, which was recorded in cost of goods sold; acquisition- and integration-related costs incurred in connection with the Sunrise Acquisition of $7.8 million, which were recorded in other expense; and the non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the financing related to the Sunrise Acquisition of $6.4 million, as well as $2.0 million", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Financial Information\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) section provides analysis of our operations and financial position for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and includes information available to March 2, 2017, unless otherwise indicated herein.

You should not place undue importance on forward-looking statements and should not rely upon this information as of any other date. Other than as required under securities laws, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking information at any particular time.\nUnless otherwise noted herein, all currency amounts in this MD&A are expressed in U.S. dollars. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nThe composition of our reportable segments is as follows:\nGlobal Ingredients aggregates our North American-based Raw Material Sourcing and Supply and European-based International Sourcing and Supply operating segments focused on the procurement and sale of specialty and organic grains and seeds, raw material ingredients, value-added grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and organic commodities.\nConsumer Products consists of three main commercial platforms: Healthy Beverages, Healthy Fruit and Healthy Snacks. Healthy Beverages includes aseptic packaged products including non-dairy and dairy beverages, broths and teas; refrigerated premium juices; and shelf-stable juices and functional waters. Healthy Fruit includes individually quick frozen (\u201cIQF\u201d) fruits for retail; IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice; and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. Healthy Snacks includes fruit snacks; nutritional and protein bars; and resealable pouch products.\nFor a more detailed description of our operating groups and their businesses, please see the \u201cBusiness\u201d section at Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a fiscal calendar that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were each 52-week periods ending on December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, whereas fiscal year 2014 was a 53-week period ending on January 3, 2015. Except as otherwise noted in this MD&A, the impact of the additional week on our results of operations for fiscal year 2014 was insignificant relative to the fiscal years 2016 or 2015.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>40 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Review\nOn June 27, 2016, we announced that we had engaged external financial and legal advisors to review our operating plan and to evaluate a range of strategic and financial actions that we could undertake to maximize shareholder value. The strategic review arose out of discussions with our largest shareholders, some of which had advocated that we examine value maximization strategies. We also announced that we had engaged a global executive search firm to assist in identifying candidates who could add additional operating, industry and capital markets experience and expertise to our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The strategic review was concluded on October 7, 2016 with our announcement of a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, \u201cOaktree\u201d).\nOn October 7, 2016, Oaktree invested $85.0 million in cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (\u201cSunOpta Foods\u201d). The shares of Preferred Stock are exchangeable into common shares of SunOpta Inc. in accordance with certain terms and conditions. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock were used to repay $79.0 million of borrowings made under our second lien loan agreement.\nValue Creation Plan\nWe are conducting, with the assistance of Oaktree, a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Through this review, management and the Board have developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The statements we make below about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including expected improvements in earnings, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), working capital efficiencies, and expected cash flows, are forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including debt service and capital expenditures.\nWe are currently targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized EBITDA enhancements and $20 million of working capital efficiencies, to be implemented over the coming 12 to 18 months. In the near-term, these benefits are expected to be offset by structural investments we are making in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources. Additionally, during 2017 we anticipate incurring non-structural third-party consulting support, severance, and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, we expect these investments to yield additional improvement in EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. Recent progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below.\nPortfolio Optimization\nThe focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where we are not effectively positioned. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the closing of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility, which is expected to be $4 million accretive to EBITDA in 2017. Following that initial announcement, we continued to evaluate our portfolio which resulted in the following additional actions:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>41 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClosure of our soy extraction (ingredient) facility in Heuvelton, New York, transferring production to our Alexandria, Minnesota facility.\nExited certain varieties of specialty soy and sunflower, as well as frozen edamame.\nExited a non-core vegetable brokerage operation.\nLaunched a global organic ingredients portfolio strategy review, which is identifying incremental large ingredient categories for further investment. The incremental growth opportunities include new geographies, new products and new processing capabilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 million associated with the Heuvelton facility closure, and $3.4 million of inventory and other reserves to reflect the exit of non-core business lines. We intend to continue to proactively manage our business portfolio to identify opportunities to drive EBITDA growth.\nOperational Excellence\nThe focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. These efforts are expected to generate productivity improvements in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. With the assistance of third-party consulting support, we have identified a number of broad-based savings opportunities to be implemented and realized over 2017 and 2018. Recent activities include:\nLaunched network-wide upgrades to worker safety and food quality programs, with the goal of becoming the leader in safety and quality across the healthy food industry.\nLaunched a productivity enhancement program that is systematically evaluating all manufacturing facilities, supply chain, and procurement processes to identify productivity cost savings. As a result of these efforts, we are targeting $30 million in annualized EBITDA improvements to be implemented over the next 12 to 18 months.\nRolled out the \u201cSunOpta Plant Management System\u201d, which consists of a standardized set of operating processes, key performance indicators, and continuous improvement methodologies that will provide improved consistency and productivity performance across the manufacturing network.\nLaunched a working capital optimization program that is targeting $20 million of cash flow enhancements.\nGo-to-Market Effectiveness\nThe focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. We expect efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Early in 2017, we re-aligned our go-to-market approach, hiring key talent to lead foodservice and retail sales, as well as adding new marketing resources. We also launched a sales force effectiveness program that has already started to generate results. Recent highlights include:\nHired a new Senior Vice President of Foodservice Sales and a Senior Vice President of Beverages and Snacks.\nSecured new business wins in Healthy Beverage, Healthy Fruit and Global Ingredients.\nSelectively adjusted pricing to enhance margins.\nProcess Sustainability\nThe focus of process sustainability is to ensure we have the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. In February 2017, we executed an organizational redesign focused on streamlining and simplifying the business, investing in systems and processes to ensure each function has the tools in place to achieve our goals. Recent initiatives include:\nDeveloped a plan to increase capital engineering, plant engineering, and process engineering capabilities that is targeted to enhance food safety, product flow and productivity performance.\nCreated a centralized Consumer Products supply chain team to manage sales and operations planning (\u201cS&OP\u201d), warehousing and distribution.\nLaunched a comprehensive S&OP program to improve supply/demand planning, which is expected to reduce inventory while improving customer service.\nInitiated a program to push centralized cost accounting resources into manufacturing facilities to improve the accuracy of manufacturing-related financial data.\n\u2003\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>42 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGovernance and Management Transitions\nEffective February 6, 2017, David Colo was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of SunOpta. In conjunction with this appointment, Mr. Colo also became a member of the Board. On November 11, 2016, Hendrik Jacobs resigned from his positions as President, CEO, and director. Director Katrina Houde served as interim CEO prior to the appointment of Mr. Colo. Ms. Houde will continue her position on the Board following Mr. Colo's appointment.\nOn October 7, 2016, we increased the size of the Board to nine directors and appointed two Oaktree-nominated independent directors, Dean Hollis and Al Bolles, Ph.D., to the Board. Also on October 7, 2016, Brendan Springstubb was appointed to the Board to replace Douglas Greene who resigned as a director. Mr. Springstubb is a Principal at Engaged Capital LLC, one of our largest shareholders. On October 9, 2016, Alan Murray stepped down from the Board and was replaced as Chair of the Board by Mr. Hollis.\nOn January 19, 2017, Gregg Tanner was appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of director Jay Amato.\nRationalization of Soy and Juice Operations\nOn December 27, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our soy extraction facility in Heuvelton, New York. We determined that our ingredients processing facility in Alexandria, Minnesota, could absorb the production volume from the Heuvelton facility, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Based on the location and use of Heuvelton facility, we recorded an impairment loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, to write down the carrying value of the associated long-lived assets to a nominal salvage value. The closure of the Heuvelton facility occurred on January 10, 2017.\nIn addition, one of our customers intends to move its private label soy- and rice-based aseptic beverage business to another supplier commencing in the second quarter of 2017. This business represented approximately 4% of the revenues from our Consumers Products segment and approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn November 8, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our San Bernardino, California juice facility, after determining that it would be more beneficial to transfer our juice production from the facility to contract manufacturers with whom we have ongoing relationships, rather than make further capital investments in support of the bottling or extraction areas of the facility. These capital investments would have been necessary to satisfy packaging format changes demanded by the facility's largest customer and to address shortfalls in contracting sufficient supply of raw citrus fruit for the upcoming season to allow for effective and efficient use of the facility's extraction capabilities. In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $10.3 million to write down the carrying value of the long-lived assets associated with the facility. The closure of the San Bernardino facility occurred on December 28, 2016. On February 28, 2017, we incurred approximately $3.0 million of additional costs related to the early termination of equipment leases associated with the facility, which will be recognized in other expense in the first quarter of 2017.\nRecall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products produced at our Crookston, Minnesota facility due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. During the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recognized estimated losses of $12.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, related to this recall. Our estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We have general liability and product recall insurance policies with aggregate limits of $47.0 million under which we are expecting to recover recall-related costs, less applicable deductibles. For the fourth quarter and last three quarters of 2016, we recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $12.0 million and $39.4 million for the losses recognized to-date related to the recall. However, we may not recover amounts equal to the amount of the losses that have been or may be recognized if those losses exceed the coverage available or are excluded under the insurance policies.\nAs a result of the recall, we have experienced the loss of a number of customers, some of which we believe we can regain once remediation efforts are completed at our sunflower roasting facilities. In addition, we are implementing a series of new food safety and quality processes at these facilities that will require significant capital investment and will have an ongoing impact on the productivity of our roasting operations. Based on an assessment of the effect on future cash flows of lower anticipated sales demand and higher expected production and capital costs, we determined that the impact of the recall on the fair value of our sunflower reporting unit reflected an impairment of the associated goodwill, resulting in a $17.5 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our assessment, however, determined that the carrying values of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of the sunflower reporting unit were recoverable as at December 31, 2016.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>43 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor more information regarding the recall, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSettlement of Plum Dispute\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with Plum, PBC (\u201cPlum\u201d), Campbell Soup Company (\u201cCampbell\u201d), and various other parties. The Settlement Agreement resolved the disputed issues among the parties in connection with the litigation filed by Plum against our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Global Organic Ingredients, Inc. (\u201cSGOI\u201d), which arose out of a voluntary recall by Plum of certain products manufactured at our Allentown, Pennsylvania facility in 2013 (see Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K).\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid Campbell $5.0 million in cash and will provide Campbell with rebates of up to $4.0 million over a four-year period in connection with Plum's purchases of pouch products and Campbell's purchases of aseptic broth products pursuant to manufacturing and supply agreements between the parties and their affiliates. In order for Campbell to obtain the full $4.0 million in rebates, Plum and Campbell must order certain minimum quantities of pouch products and aseptic broth products within each of the designated twelve-month periods over the four-year rebate period. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, we recorded a charge of $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, as we believe there is reasonable assurance that the minimum order quantities will be achieved.\nSale of Opta Minerals\nOn February 11, 2016, Opta Minerals entered into a definitive acquisition agreement, pursuant to which an affiliate of Speyside Equity Fund I LP (\u201cSpeyside\u201d) agreed to acquire substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Opta Minerals. The acquisition of Opta Minerals by Speyside was completed on April 6, 2016, following a vote of the shareholders of Opta Minerals in favor of the transaction on March 31, 2016.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $4.8 million (C$6.2 million), of which $3.2 million (C$4.2 million) was received in cash, with the remainder received in the form of a $1.5 million (C$2.0 million) subordinated promissory note bearing interest at 2.0% per annum that will mature on October 6, 2018. We incurred direct costs related to the sale of Opta Minerals of $0.8 million. The sale of our equity interest in Opta Minerals was consistent with our objective of divesting our non-core assets in order to become a pure-play healthy and organic foods company. We have no significant continuing involvement with Opta Minerals.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a loss on classification of Opta Minerals as a discontinued operation held for sale of $10.5 million, or $7.7 million net of non-controlling interest, to write down the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets to fair value less cost to sell based on estimated net proceeds on sale of approximately $4.5 million as at January 2, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we recognized a $0.6 million gain on classification as held for sale which reflected a $1.1 million decline in the carrying value of Opta Minerals' net assets, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in the estimated net proceeds on sale. We have not recognized the results of operations or cash flows of Opta Minerals for the period from April 1, 2016 to the closing of the transaction on April 6, 2016, as these amounts were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding the sale of Opta Minerals, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nFive-Year Global Revolving Asset-Based Credit Facility\nOn February 11, 2016, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $350 million, subject to borrowing base capacity (the \u201cGlobal Credit Facility\u201d), as described below under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nAcquisition of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc.\nOn October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunrise Holding (Delaware), Inc. (\u201cSunrise\u201d), pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 30, 2015 (the \u201cSunrise Acquisition\u201d), for total consideration of $472.7 million in cash. Sunrise is a processor of conventional and organic individually quick frozen fruit in the U.S. The acquisition of Sunrise is aligned with our strategic focus on healthy and organic foods. Sunrise has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>44 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2016, we initiated the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition. Consequently, we transferred all production volume from our Buena Park, California facility into Sunrise's facilities located in Kansas and California. In 2016, we recognized severance and rationalization costs of $2.4 million related to closure of the Buena Park facility and associated corporate office located in Cerritos, California.\nAcquisition of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc.\nOn August 11, 2015, we acquired the net operating assets of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc. (\u201cNiagara Natural\u201d), a manufacturer of all-natural fruit snacks. Niagara Natural's operations are located in the Niagara Region of Ontario. The transaction included a cash purchase price of $6.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to approximately $2.8 million based on specific performance targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was determined to be $2.3 million as at the acquisition date. Niagara Natural is a strong strategic fit within our core consumer products strategy and has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Niagara Natural, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 5, 2016, we entered an agreement with the owners of Niagara Natural to settle the contingent consideration obligation in exchange for a one-time cash payment of $0.6 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million in connection with this settlement, based on the difference between the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of $2.3 million as at April 2, 2016 and the cash payment.\nAcquisition of Citrusource, LLC\nOn March 2, 2015, we acquired Citrusource, LLC (\u201cCitrusource\u201d), a producer of premium not-from-concentrate private label organic and conventional orange juice and citrus products in the U.S. We paid $13.3 million in cash at closing and we may pay additional consideration based on the incremental growth in Citrusource's base business. The fair value of the total consideration transferred to acquire Citrusource was $31.7 million as at the acquisition date. The acquisition of Citrusource aligned with our strategy of growing our value-added consumer products portfolio. Citrusource has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition. For more information regarding the acquisition of Citrusource, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSale of Fiber and Starch Business\nOn December 22, 2014, we completed the sale of our fiber and starch business (the \u201cFiber Business\u201d) for $37.5 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The Fiber Business included five facilities located in Louisville, Kentucky, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Cambridge, Minnesota, Fosston, Minnesota, and Galesburg, Illinois, and was formerly part of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. We continue to operate both our integrated grain- and fruit-based ingredient businesses, which were not part of the sale, and which previously formed the remainder of the former Value Added Ingredients operating segment. For more information regarding the sale of the Fiber Business, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most significant to our business.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place; price is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Consideration given to customers such as value incentives, rebates, early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>45 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nOur accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers. The carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us. In assessing the amount of reserve required, a number of factors are considered including the age of the account, the credit-worthiness of the customer, payment terms, the customer's historical payment history and general economic conditions. Because the amount of the reserve is an estimate, the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable. Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventory\nInventory is our largest current asset and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, measured on a weighted-average cost basis, or estimated net realizable value except for certain grain inventories that are carried at market value. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. These factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products, and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans, and expected market conditions. As a result, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. We perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis. Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the movements in the inventory reserve.\nIntangible Assets\nWe evaluate amortizable intangible assets acquired through business combinations for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, such as the loss of a significant customer; current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, such as the introduction of a competing product that results in a significant loss of market share; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, an intangible asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as a plan to exit a product line or business in the near term.\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. A discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value using estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply. Some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flows, and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, an intangible asset's expected useful life can increase estimation risk, as longer-lived assets necessarily require longer-term cash flow forecasts, which for some of our long-lived assets can be in excess of 20 years. In connection with an impairment evaluation, we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it, as appropriate.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available. To evaluate goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists. Any impairment loss is recognized in earnings.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>46 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically measure the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach). Because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted cash flows include a terminal value. Cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth and our planned business strategies in future periods. Examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility; a reduction of working capital at a specific location; and price increases or cost reductions within a reporting unit. The discount rate is based on a reporting unit's targeted weighted-average cost of capital, which is not necessarily the same as our weighted-average cost of capital. These assumptions are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained. Each year we re-evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment.\nWe perform our annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Based on the results of the quantitative test performed for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million, which reflected the negative impact on future cash flows of the recall of certain roasted sunflower kernel products (as described above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d). Our quantitative test for 2016 indicated that a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of each of our other reporting units would not have triggered additional impairment testing. Based on the results of the quantitative tests performed for the years ended January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, we determined that none of the goodwill associated with any of our reporting units was impaired in either of those fiscal years.\nAcquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.\nThe assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired are among the most significant in our acquisition accounting and generally require the most judgment. Key variables in determining the fair value of customer relationships are the estimated customer attrition rate and the percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers. Changes to either or both of these variables could have a significant impact on the customer relationships intangible assets' values, and changes to the estimated customer attrition rate could have a significant impact on the estimated useful lives of these assets. The expected customer attrition rate assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is generally supported by an analysis of historical attrition of the acquired business's customers and consideration of its amortization policy of previously acquired customer relationships, amortization policies adopted for acquired customer relationships by other companies in similar transactions, and the contractual terms between the acquired business and its customers. The percentage of revenue growth attributable to existing customers assumed in the estimate of fair value for the customer relationships intangible assets is typically supported by an analysis of the acquired business's historical and forecasted revenue growth rates by customer. Changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets could have a significant impact on the amounts assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation. Future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an increase or decrease in amortization expense, or impairment of the intangible assets and/or goodwill. Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note 9 outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles.\nSome acquisitions involve contingent consideration to be potentially paid based on the achievement of specified future financial targets by the acquired business. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially recognized as a liability at estimated fair value and re-measured each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings. These estimates of fair value involve uncertainties as they include assumptions about the likelihood of achieving the specified financial targets, projections of future financial performance, and assumed discount rates. A change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could impact the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities in the purchase price allocation, or the amounts recognized in earnings to reflect subsequent changes in the carrying value of the liability. Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K includes disclosures regarding the estimated fair value of contingent consideration.\nContingencies\nWe make estimates for payments that are contingent on the outcome of uncertain future events. These contingencies include accrued but unpaid bonuses; tax-related matters; and claims or litigation. In establishing our estimates, we consider historical experience with similar contingencies and the progress of each contingency, as well as the recommendations of internal and external advisors and legal counsel. We re-evaluate all contingencies as additional information becomes available; however, given the inherent uncertainties, the ultimate amount paid could differ from our estimates.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>SUNOPTA INC. </td> <td>47 </td> <td>December 31, 2016 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn particular, as discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments - Recall of Certain Roasted Sunflower Kernel Products\u201d, we have recognized estimated losses of $40.0 million related to this recall as at December 31, 2016. These estimates are provisional and were determined based on an assessment of the information available up to the date of filing of this report, including a review of customer claims received as of that date and consideration of the extent of potential additional claims that have yet to be received. We may need to revise these estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims that may be received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are liable for income taxes in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences, investment and other tax credits, the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions, enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year, the benefit of cross-jurisdictional financing structures, changes due to foreign exchange, changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets, and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations.\nIn making an estimate of our income tax liability, we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction. This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes. These differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet. We also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable. This judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts. We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied, the number of years based on management's estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances. If different judgments had been used, our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded. In addition, the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment. Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets.\nWhile we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal, provincial, state and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to selected employees and directors. For grants of stock options, we are required to estimate a number of inputs at each grant date, such as the estimated life of the option, future stock price volatility, and the forfeiture rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non-employee directors. We determine the expected life of a stock option using the simplified method, as we changed the vesting period of our stock option grants from five years to three years in 2016, and the contractual term of our stock option grants from six years to 10 years in 2012 and, as a result, we do not believe historical exercise data provides a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life. Future stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common shares over the expected life of the stock option. Once determined at the grant date, the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted. Refer to note 14 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for disclosure of the inputs used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation.\nTable 69: <table>
