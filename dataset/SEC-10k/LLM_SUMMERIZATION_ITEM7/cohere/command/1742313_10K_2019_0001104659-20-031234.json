MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nMonroe Capital Income Plus Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2018. On January 14, 2019, we elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019 and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC.\nAs an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe are conducting a best efforts, continuous private offering of our common stock to accredited investors\u201d in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (a Private Offering\u201d). At each closing an investor will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. At each closing, investors will be required to fund their full subscription to purchase shares of our common stock. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial closing of the Private Offering on January 15, 2019.\nOn June 27, 2018, we issued and sold 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000 ($10.00 per share) to MC Management, an affiliate of MC Advisors, our investment adviser. The sale of our common stock was approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) at the time.\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of shares pursuant to the Private Offering during the year ended December 31, 2019:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares Issued </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NAV Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Proceeds </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>January 15, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,175,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 2, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,966,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 4, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 8, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>July 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,384,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,843,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>October 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,527,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,275,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,224,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we also issued 52,032 shares with an aggregate value of $520,321 under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\nWe are a specialty finance company that is focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States and Canada. We seek to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection associated with investing in asset based and secured corporate private credit opportunities in a manner that is decoupled from public markets' volatility. We seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection by investing primarily in secured private credit transactions and assets, targeting investments that have significant downside protection through a focus on asset coverage. We expect to invest primarily in: (i) senior secured and junior secured and unsecured loans, notes, bonds, preferred equity (including preferred partnership equity), convertible debt and other securities; (ii) unitranche secured loans (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a first out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a last out\u201d portion of the loan) and securities; (iii) asset-based loans and securities; (iv) small business loans and leases; (v) structured debt and structured equity; (vi) syndicated loans; (vii) securitized debt and subordinated notes of collateralized loan obligations ( CLO\u201d) facilities, asset-backed securities and other securitized products and warehouse loan facilities; (viii) opportunities to acquire illiquid investments from other third-party funds as a result of liquidity constraints resulting from investor redemptions and market dislocations; and (ix) capital investments in the secondary markets. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 98.5% senior secured debt, 1.0% unitranche secured debt and 0.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWe seek to use Monroe Capital's extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in senior secured, unitranche secured and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We believe that our focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, more comprehensive and restrictive covenants, more expansive events of default, relatively small debt facilities that provide us with enhanced influence over our borrowers, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income\nWe generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche secured or junior secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company ( LLC\u201d) and limited partnership ( LP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. The frequency and volume of the distributions on common equity securities and LLC and LP investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of base management and incentive fees to MC Advisors under the investment advisory agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d), the payment of fees to MC Management for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the administration agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Administration Agreement\u201d) and other operating costs. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Related Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on indebtedness. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss)\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested $104,418,184 in 39 new portfolio companies and had $4,638,209 in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $99,779,975 for the year.\nThe following table shows portfolio yield by security type:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nAnnualized\nEffective Yield (2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The weighted average annualized contractual coupon yield at period end is computed by dividing (a) the interest income on debt investments at the period end contractual coupon rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments at period end is computed by dividing (a) interest income on debt investments at the period end effective rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments.

MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors, through its internal Portfolio Management Group ( PMG\u201d), will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. The PMG is responsible for oversight and management of any investments rated in grades 3, 4, or 5. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. The investment performance rating system is described as follows:\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>Investment\nPerformance\nRisk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Summary Description </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 4 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the PMG, in consultation with the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors and the PMG will form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve our value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. The PMG and the investment committee have extensive experience in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance risk rating scale as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>Investment Performance Risk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Investments </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,727,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,079,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,806,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nWe are a newly-formed entity that commenced our principal operations on January 15, 2019.

To maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of $20,000 for U.S. federal excise tax.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOne of our consolidated subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations of zero for this subsidiary.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had sales of investments of $357,521, resulting in $5,169 of net realized gain (loss) on investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our investments had $875,663 of net change in unrealized gain (loss). The net change in unrealized gain (loss) may include both unrealized gain on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized loss on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $3,162,728 primarily as a result of net investment income earned on our investments and net mark-to-market gains on our investments. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $0.79.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of private offerings, (ii) cash flows from our operations, and (iii) borrowings under our existing credit facility and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. These financings may come in the form of borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary uses of cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying MC Advisors and reimbursements to MC Management), (iii) debt service of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2,222,887 in cash, $1,840,821 in restricted cash at the SPV, and $31,200,000 debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We had $43,800,000 available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility. See Borrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $4,062,708. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $93,703,034, primarily as a result of net purchases of portfolio investments. During the same period we generated $97,765,742 from financing activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $1,000, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nCapital Resources\nAs a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, including our current Private Offering, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders have approved such sales. As of December 31, 2019, we had 6,874,532 shares outstanding.\nIn connection with our organization, the Board and MC Management, our initial stockholder, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result of this approval, we are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio based on aggregate borrowings outstanding was 320% and 0%, respectively.\nBorrowings\nOn March 12, 2019, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association through our wholly owned subsidiary, the SPV. On June 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) to the Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Revolving Security Agreement\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment amended the Revolving Security Agreement to increase the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $50,000,000 from $25,000,000 pursuant to the accordion feature and to expand the definition of eligible loans\u201d to include covenant lite loans. On December 6, 2019, we increased the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $75,000,000 from $50,000,000. Borrowing under the Credit Facility remains subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act, as amended.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants as well as availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 60% of the principal balance of our portfolio company investments depending on how many portfolio companies are pledged as collateral in the SPV. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV is permitted to reinvest available cash and make new borrowings under the Credit Facility through March 12, 2020. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is March 12, 2021. Distributions from the SPV to us are limited by the terms of the Credit Facility, which generally allows for the distribution of net interest income pursuant to a waterfall quarterly during the reinvestment period. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investments held in the SPV as collateral for the Credit Facility was $91,439,632 and these investments are identified on the accompanying consolidated schedule of investments. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $31,200,000.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (one or three month, at the SPV's option) plus 3.00% until March 12, 2020 and LIBOR plus 3.25% thereafter. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings, the SPV was required to pay an unused commitment fee of 0.35% from the closing date until June 11, 2019, and thereafter (i) 0.75% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are less than or equal to 30% of the facility amount, (ii) 0.55% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 30% of the facility amount but less than or equal to 50% of the facility amount, and (iii) 0.35% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 50% of the facility amount. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred financing costs of $402,389 in conjunction with the Credit Facility, which have been capitalized within unamortized deferred financing costs and are amortized into interest and other debt financing expenses over the estimated average life of the borrowings.\nSee Recent Developments\u201d for information on the March 6, 2020 amendment of our Credit Facility.\nDistributions\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be distributed is determined by our Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually.\nThe determination of the tax attributes for our distributions is made annually, based upon our taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital. Distributions declared to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3,162,728 ($0.77 per share). None of the $1,776,190 in distributions paid to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a return of capital. The tax character of such distributions is determined at the end of the fiscal year.\nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of its stockholders that elect to participate in such plan. As a result, if we declare a dividend or distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will only be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock if a stockholder specifically opts in\u201d to the DRIP at least ten (10) days prior to the record date fixed by the Board. Shares issued under the DRIP will be issued at a price per share equal to the most recent NAV per share as determined by the Board.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>We have an Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities.

These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, capital expenditure loans, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements totaling $14,323,532. We believe that our available cash balances and/or ability to draw on the Credit Facility provide sufficient funds to cover our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have entered into certain contracts with other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, we have not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believe the risk of loss related to such indemnifications to be remote.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there has been a significant amount of capital raised over the past several years dedicated to middle market lending which has increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields and weaker financial covenants for new assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues including changes in bank regulations for middle-market banks has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through March 10, 2020, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were issued.\nOn January 2, 2020, we issued 2,036,841 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for proceeds of $20,368,410 pursuant to the Private Offering.\nOn March 6, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving and Security Agreement to extend the reinvestment period of our Credit Facility through April 10, 2020 as we negotiate a larger amendment to our Credit Facility.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and then we amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nAs a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America to determine the fair value of the security. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available or whose market prices are not regularly updated are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of MC Advisors responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. We will consult with independent valuation firm(s) relative to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year, but the independent appraisals are generally received quarterly; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>to the extent an independent valuation firm is not engaged to conduct an investment appraisal on an investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the investment will be valued by the MC Advisors investment professional responsible for the credit monitoring; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the audit committee of our Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and MC Advisors adjusts or further supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally use the income approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. This liquidation analysis may also include probability weighting of alternative outcomes. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner, the loan is in covenant compliance and is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, we consider fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the debt instrument.\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the income approach, discounted cash flow models are utilized to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the income approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, the enterprise value methodology is typically utilized to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nNet Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss\nWe measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gain or loss previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gain or loss is realized. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreement). This fee equals 15% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $132,125 based on the performance of our portfolio, $775 of which was payable to MC Advisors as a result of realized gains. The remaining $131,350 was based on unrealized appreciation, none of which was payable to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nOrganization and Offering Costs and Expenses\nOrganization costs refer to the cost of organizing as a Maryland corporation, including, among other things, the cost of legal services, directors' fees and other fees, including travel-related expenses, pertaining to our organization. Offering costs include, among other things, legal fees and other costs pertaining to the preparation of our private placement memorandum and other offering documents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, MC Management has incurred organization and offering costs of approximately $418,925 on our behalf. MC Management has agreed to absorb and pay on our behalf up to $425,000 for organization and offering costs. If the expenses incurred by us are greater than $425,000, we will reimburse MC Management for organization and offering costs incurred on our behalf in excess of $425,000.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nMonroe Capital Income Plus Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2018. On January 14, 2019, we elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019 and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC.\nAs an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe are conducting a best efforts, continuous private offering of our common stock to accredited investors\u201d in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (a Private Offering\u201d). At each closing an investor will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. At each closing, investors will be required to fund their full subscription to purchase shares of our common stock. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial closing of the Private Offering on January 15, 2019.\nOn June 27, 2018, we issued and sold 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000 ($10.00 per share) to MC Management, an affiliate of MC Advisors, our investment adviser. The sale of our common stock was approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) at the time.\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of shares pursuant to the Private Offering during the year ended December 31, 2019:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we also issued 52,032 shares with an aggregate value of $520,321 under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\nWe are a specialty finance company that is focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States and Canada. We seek to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection associated with investing in asset based and secured corporate private credit opportunities in a manner that is decoupled from public markets' volatility. We seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection by investing primarily in secured private credit transactions and assets, targeting investments that have significant downside protection through a focus on asset coverage. We expect to invest primarily in: (i) senior secured and junior secured and unsecured loans, notes, bonds, preferred equity (including preferred partnership equity), convertible debt and other securities; (ii) unitranche secured loans (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a first out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a last out\u201d portion of the loan) and securities; (iii) asset-based loans and securities; (iv) small business loans and leases; (v) structured debt and structured equity; (vi) syndicated loans; (vii) securitized debt and subordinated notes of collateralized loan obligations ( CLO\u201d) facilities, asset-backed securities and other securitized products and warehouse loan facilities; (viii) opportunities to acquire illiquid investments from other third-party funds as a result of liquidity constraints resulting from investor redemptions and market dislocations; and (ix) capital investments in the secondary markets. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 98.5% senior secured debt, 1.0% unitranche secured debt and 0.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWe seek to use Monroe Capital's extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in senior secured, unitranche secured and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We believe that our focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, more comprehensive and restrictive covenants, more expansive events of default, relatively small debt facilities that provide us with enhanced influence over our borrowers, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow.\n 51 \nInvestment income\nWe generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche secured or junior secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company ( LLC\u201d) and limited partnership ( LP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. The frequency and volume of the distributions on common equity securities and LLC and LP investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of base management and incentive fees to MC Advisors under the investment advisory agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d), the payment of fees to MC Management for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the administration agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Administration Agreement\u201d) and other operating costs. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Related Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on indebtedness. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss)\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested $104,418,184 in 39 new portfolio companies and had $4,638,209 in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $99,779,975 for the year.\nThe following table shows portfolio yield by security type:\n\n (1) The weighted average annualized contractual coupon yield at period end is computed by dividing (a) the interest income on debt investments at the period end contractual coupon rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments. (2) The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments at period end is computed by dividing (a) interest income on debt investments at the period end effective rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments. The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments is a metric on the investment portfolio alone and does not represent a return to stockholders. This metric is not inclusive of our fees and expenses, the impact of leverage on the portfolio or sales load that may be paid by investors. \n 52 \nThe following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio:\n\nThe following table shows our portfolio composition by industry:\n\nThere were no investments outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nMC Advisors' portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors, through its internal Portfolio Management Group ( PMG\u201d), will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. The PMG is responsible for oversight and management of any investments rated in grades 3, 4, or 5. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. The investment performance rating system is described as follows:\n 53 \n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full. \nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the PMG, in consultation with the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors and the PMG will form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve our value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. The PMG and the investment committee have extensive experience in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance risk rating scale as of December 31, 2019:\n\nResults of Operations\nWe are a newly-formed entity that commenced our principal operations on January 15, 2019. Since we commenced principal operations on January 15, 2019, we therefore have no prior periods with which to compare our operating results.\nOperating results were as follows:\n\n 54 \nInvestment Income\nThe composition of our investment income was as follows:\n\nOperating Expenses\nThe composition of our operating expenses was as follows:\n\nBase management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $734,918, and MC Advisors elected to voluntarily waive $432,993 of these base management fees. Incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $250,735, and MC Advisors elected to voluntarily waive the part one incentive fees of $118,610 for the year. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d below for additional information.\nMC Management agreed to reimburse us for administrative expenses (not to include management fees or leverage facility expenses) incurred by us of $544,084 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, we have recorded a receivable for the remaining reimbursement from MC Management for $14,448 on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities within due from affiliates and a contra expense for $544,084 on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe composition of our interest and other debt financing expenses and average outstanding balance was as follows:\n\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment available to RICs. To maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of $20,000 for U.S. federal excise tax.\n 55 \nOne of our consolidated subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations of zero for this subsidiary.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had sales of investments of $357,521, resulting in $5,169 of net realized gain (loss) on investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our investments had $875,663 of net change in unrealized gain (loss). The net change in unrealized gain (loss) may include both unrealized gain on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized loss on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $3,162,728 primarily as a result of net investment income earned on our investments and net mark-to-market gains on our investments. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $0.79.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of private offerings, (ii) cash flows from our operations, and (iii) borrowings under our existing credit facility and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. These financings may come in the form of borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary uses of cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying MC Advisors and reimbursements to MC Management), (iii) debt service of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2,222,887 in cash, $1,840,821 in restricted cash at the SPV, and $31,200,000 debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We had $43,800,000 available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility. See Borrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $4,062,708. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $93,703,034, primarily as a result of net purchases of portfolio investments. During the same period we generated $97,765,742 from financing activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $1,000, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nCapital Resources\nAs a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, including our current Private Offering, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders have approved such sales. As of December 31, 2019, we had 6,874,532 shares outstanding.\nIn connection with our organization, the Board and MC Management, our initial stockholder, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result of this approval, we are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio based on aggregate borrowings outstanding was 320% and 0%, respectively.\nBorrowings\nOn March 12, 2019, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association through our wholly owned subsidiary, the SPV. On June 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) to the Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Revolving Security Agreement\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment amended the Revolving Security Agreement to increase the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $50,000,000 from $25,000,000 pursuant to the accordion feature and to expand the definition of eligible loans\u201d to include covenant lite loans. On December 6, 2019, we increased the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $75,000,000 from $50,000,000. Borrowing under the Credit Facility remains subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act, as amended.\n 56 \nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants as well as availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 60% of the principal balance of our portfolio company investments depending on how many portfolio companies are pledged as collateral in the SPV. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV is permitted to reinvest available cash and make new borrowings under the Credit Facility through March 12, 2020. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is March 12, 2021. Distributions from the SPV to us are limited by the terms of the Credit Facility, which generally allows for the distribution of net interest income pursuant to a waterfall quarterly during the reinvestment period. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investments held in the SPV as collateral for the Credit Facility was $91,439,632 and these investments are identified on the accompanying consolidated schedule of investments. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $31,200,000.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (one or three month, at the SPV's option) plus 3.00% until March 12, 2020 and LIBOR plus 3.25% thereafter. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings, the SPV was required to pay an unused commitment fee of 0.35% from the closing date until June 11, 2019, and thereafter (i) 0.75% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are less than or equal to 30% of the facility amount, (ii) 0.55% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 30% of the facility amount but less than or equal to 50% of the facility amount, and (iii) 0.35% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 50% of the facility amount. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred financing costs of $402,389 in conjunction with the Credit Facility, which have been capitalized within unamortized deferred financing costs and are amortized into interest and other debt financing expenses over the estimated average life of the borrowings.\nSee Recent Developments\u201d for information on the March 6, 2020 amendment of our Credit Facility.\nDistributions\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be distributed is determined by our Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually.\nThe determination of the tax attributes for our distributions is made annually, based upon our taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital. Distributions declared to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3,162,728 ($0.77 per share). None of the $1,776,190 in distributions paid to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a return of capital. The tax character of such distributions is determined at the end of the fiscal year.\nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of its stockholders that elect to participate in such plan. As a result, if we declare a dividend or distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will only be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock if a stockholder specifically opts in\u201d to the DRIP at least ten (10) days prior to the record date fixed by the Board. Shares issued under the DRIP will be issued at a price per share equal to the most recent NAV per share as determined by the Board.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u00b7 We have an Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d for additional information. \n \u00b7 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 Theodore L. Koenig, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board is also a manager of MC Advisors and the President and Chief Executive Officer of MC Management. Aaron D. Peck, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, is also a managing director of MC Management. \n \u00b7 We have a license agreement with Monroe Capital LLC, under which Monroe Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Monroe Capital\u201d for specified purposes in our business. \nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of MC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law.\n 57 \nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations for repayment as of December 31, 2019:\n\n (1) Unfunded commitments represent all amounts unfunded as of December 31, 2019. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2019. \nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, capital expenditure loans, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements totaling $14,323,532. We believe that our available cash balances and/or ability to draw on the Credit Facility provide sufficient funds to cover our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have entered into certain contracts with other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, we have not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believe the risk of loss related to such indemnifications to be remote.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there has been a significant amount of capital raised over the past several years dedicated to middle market lending which has increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields and weaker financial covenants for new assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues including changes in bank regulations for middle-market banks has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through March 10, 2020, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were issued.\nOn January 2, 2020, we issued 2,036,841 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for proceeds of $20,368,410 pursuant to the Private Offering.\nOn March 6, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving and Security Agreement to extend the reinvestment period of our Credit Facility through April 10, 2020 as we negotiate a larger amendment to our Credit Facility.\n 58 \nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and then we amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nAs a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America to determine the fair value of the security. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available or whose market prices are not regularly updated are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u00b7 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of MC Advisors responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; \n \u00b7 our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. We will consult with independent valuation firm(s) relative to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year, but the independent appraisals are generally received quarterly; \n \u00b7 to the extent an independent valuation firm is not engaged to conduct an investment appraisal on an investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the investment will be valued by the MC Advisors investment professional responsible for the credit monitoring; \n \u00b7 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; \n \u00b7 the audit committee of our Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and MC Advisors adjusts or further supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and \n \u00b7 our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. \nWe generally use the income approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. This liquidation analysis may also include probability weighting of alternative outcomes. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner, the loan is in covenant compliance and is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, we consider fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the debt instrument.\n 59 \nUnder the income approach, discounted cash flow models are utilized to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the income approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, the enterprise value methodology is typically utilized to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nNet Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss\nWe measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gain or loss previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gain or loss is realized. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreement). This fee equals 15% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $132,125 based on the performance of our portfolio, $775 of which was payable to MC Advisors as a result of realized gains. The remaining $131,350 was based on unrealized appreciation, none of which was payable to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nOrganization and Offering Costs and Expenses\nOrganization costs refer to the cost of organizing as a Maryland corporation, including, among other things, the cost of legal services, directors' fees and other fees, including travel-related expenses, pertaining to our organization. Offering costs include, among other things, legal fees and other costs pertaining to the preparation of our private placement memorandum and other offering documents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, MC Management has incurred organization and offering costs of approximately $418,925 on our behalf. MC Management has agreed to absorb and pay on our behalf up to $425,000 for organization and offering costs. If the expenses incurred by us are greater than $425,000, we will reimburse MC Management for organization and offering costs incurred on our behalf in excess of $425,000. As these costs have not exceeded the amount to be reimbursed by MC Management as of December 31, 2019, we have not recorded any such costs.\n 60 \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d). The primary objective of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements in the notes to the financial statements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, Fast Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, amending certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements and to provide for a consistent set of rules to govern incorporating information by reference and hyperlinking, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. We have adopted the final rule, as applicable, and determined the effect was limited to the modification and removal of certain disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nMonroe Capital Income Plus Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2018. On January 14, 2019, we elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019 and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC.\nAs an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe are conducting a best efforts, continuous private offering of our common stock to accredited investors\u201d in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (a Private Offering\u201d). At each closing an investor will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. At each closing, investors will be required to fund their full subscription to purchase shares of our common stock. We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial closing of the Private Offering on January 15, 2019.\nOn June 27, 2018, we issued and sold 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000 ($10.00 per share) to MC Management, an affiliate of MC Advisors, our investment adviser. The sale of our common stock was approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) at the time.\nThe following table summarizes the issuance of shares pursuant to the Private Offering during the year ended December 31, 2019:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Shares Issued </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NAV Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Proceeds </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>January 15, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,175,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 2, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,966,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 4, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,755,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>April 8, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>July 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,384,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,843,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>October 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,527,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,275,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total proceeds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,224,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we also issued 52,032 shares with an aggregate value of $520,321 under our Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( DRIP\u201d).\nWe are a specialty finance company that is focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States and Canada. We seek to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection associated with investing in asset based and secured corporate private credit opportunities in a manner that is decoupled from public markets' volatility. We seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and downside protection by investing primarily in secured private credit transactions and assets, targeting investments that have significant downside protection through a focus on asset coverage. We expect to invest primarily in: (i) senior secured and junior secured and unsecured loans, notes, bonds, preferred equity (including preferred partnership equity), convertible debt and other securities; (ii) unitranche secured loans (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a first out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a last out\u201d portion of the loan) and securities; (iii) asset-based loans and securities; (iv) small business loans and leases; (v) structured debt and structured equity; (vi) syndicated loans; (vii) securitized debt and subordinated notes of collateralized loan obligations ( CLO\u201d) facilities, asset-backed securities and other securitized products and warehouse loan facilities; (viii) opportunities to acquire illiquid investments from other third-party funds as a result of liquidity constraints resulting from investor redemptions and market dislocations; and (ix) capital investments in the secondary markets. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 98.5% senior secured debt, 1.0% unitranche secured debt and 0.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWe seek to use Monroe Capital's extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in senior secured, unitranche secured and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We believe that our focus on lending to lower middle-market companies offers several advantages as compared to lending to larger companies, including more attractive economics, lower leverage, more comprehensive and restrictive covenants, more expansive events of default, relatively small debt facilities that provide us with enhanced influence over our borrowers, direct access to borrower management and improved information flow.\n 51 \nInvestment income\nWe generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche secured or junior secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company ( LLC\u201d) and limited partnership ( LP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. The frequency and volume of the distributions on common equity securities and LLC and LP investments may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of base management and incentive fees to MC Advisors under the investment advisory agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d), the payment of fees to MC Management for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the administration agreement entered into on December 5, 2018 (the Administration Agreement\u201d) and other operating costs. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Related Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on indebtedness. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss)\nWe recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested $104,418,184 in 39 new portfolio companies and had $4,638,209 in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $99,779,975 for the year.\nThe following table shows portfolio yield by security type:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nAnnualized\nEffective Yield (2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The weighted average annualized contractual coupon yield at period end is computed by dividing (a) the interest income on debt investments at the period end contractual coupon rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments. (2) The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments at period end is computed by dividing (a) interest income on debt investments at the period end effective rate for each investment by (b) the par value of our debt investments. The weighted average annualized effective yield on portfolio investments is a metric on the investment portfolio alone and does not represent a return to stockholders. This metric is not inclusive of our fees and expenses, the impact of leverage on the portfolio or sales load that may be paid by investors. \n 52 \nThe following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fair Value: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,334,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,806,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows our portfolio composition by industry:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fair Value: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Aerospace & Defense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,745,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Automotive </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,791,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Banking, Finance, Insurance & Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,588,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beverage, Food & Tobacco </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,629,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer Goods: Non-Durable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,237,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Containers, Packaging & Glass </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,985,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy: Oil & Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,051,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,453,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>High Tech Industries </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,179,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Media: Advertising, Printing & Publishing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,020,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Media: Broadcasting & Subscription </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,118,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Media: Diversified & Production </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,995,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services: Business </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,199,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services: Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,308,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telecommunications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,501,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,806,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no investments outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nMC Advisors' portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors, through its internal Portfolio Management Group ( PMG\u201d), will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. The PMG is responsible for oversight and management of any investments rated in grades 3, 4, or 5. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. The investment performance rating system is described as follows:\n 53 \n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full. \nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the PMG, in consultation with the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors and the PMG will form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve our value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. The PMG and the investment committee have extensive experience in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance risk rating scale as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>Investment Performance Risk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Investments at\nFair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Investments </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,727,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,079,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,806,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nWe are a newly-formed entity that commenced our principal operations on January 15, 2019.

To maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income may exceed estimated current year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net expense on the consolidated statements of operations of $20,000 for U.S. federal excise tax.\n 55 \nOne of our consolidated subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations of zero for this subsidiary.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had sales of investments of $357,521, resulting in $5,169 of net realized gain (loss) on investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our investments had $875,663 of net change in unrealized gain (loss). The net change in unrealized gain (loss) may include both unrealized gain on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized loss on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $3,162,728 primarily as a result of net investment income earned on our investments and net mark-to-market gains on our investments. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $0.79.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of private offerings, (ii) cash flows from our operations, and (iii) borrowings under our existing credit facility and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. These financings may come in the form of borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary uses of cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying MC Advisors and reimbursements to MC Management), (iii) debt service of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2,222,887 in cash, $1,840,821 in restricted cash at the SPV, and $31,200,000 debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We had $43,800,000 available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility. See Borrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $4,062,708. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $93,703,034, primarily as a result of net purchases of portfolio investments. During the same period we generated $97,765,742 from financing activities, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $1,000, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nCapital Resources\nAs a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, including our current Private Offering, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders have approved such sales. As of December 31, 2019, we had 6,874,532 shares outstanding.\nIn connection with our organization, the Board and MC Management, our initial stockholder, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result of this approval, we are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio based on aggregate borrowings outstanding was 320% and 0%, respectively.\nBorrowings\nOn March 12, 2019, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association through our wholly owned subsidiary, the SPV. On June 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) to the Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Revolving Security Agreement\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment amended the Revolving Security Agreement to increase the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $50,000,000 from $25,000,000 pursuant to the accordion feature and to expand the definition of eligible loans\u201d to include covenant lite loans. On December 6, 2019, we increased the size of the current revolver commitments under the Credit Facility to $75,000,000 from $50,000,000. Borrowing under the Credit Facility remains subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act, as amended.\n 56 \nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants as well as availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 60% of the principal balance of our portfolio company investments depending on how many portfolio companies are pledged as collateral in the SPV. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV is permitted to reinvest available cash and make new borrowings under the Credit Facility through March 12, 2020. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is March 12, 2021. Distributions from the SPV to us are limited by the terms of the Credit Facility, which generally allows for the distribution of net interest income pursuant to a waterfall quarterly during the reinvestment period. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investments held in the SPV as collateral for the Credit Facility was $91,439,632 and these investments are identified on the accompanying consolidated schedule of investments. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $31,200,000.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (one or three month, at the SPV's option) plus 3.00% until March 12, 2020 and LIBOR plus 3.25% thereafter. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings, the SPV was required to pay an unused commitment fee of 0.35% from the closing date until June 11, 2019, and thereafter (i) 0.75% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are less than or equal to 30% of the facility amount, (ii) 0.55% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 30% of the facility amount but less than or equal to 50% of the facility amount, and (iii) 0.35% per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility when the outstanding borrowings are greater than 50% of the facility amount. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred financing costs of $402,389 in conjunction with the Credit Facility, which have been capitalized within unamortized deferred financing costs and are amortized into interest and other debt financing expenses over the estimated average life of the borrowings.\nSee Recent Developments\u201d for information on the March 6, 2020 amendment of our Credit Facility.\nDistributions\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be distributed is determined by our Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually.\nThe determination of the tax attributes for our distributions is made annually, based upon our taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital. Distributions declared to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3,162,728 ($0.77 per share). None of the $1,776,190 in distributions paid to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a return of capital. The tax character of such distributions is determined at the end of the fiscal year.\nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of its stockholders that elect to participate in such plan. As a result, if we declare a dividend or distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will only be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock if a stockholder specifically opts in\u201d to the DRIP at least ten (10) days prior to the record date fixed by the Board. Shares issued under the DRIP will be issued at a price per share equal to the most recent NAV per share as determined by the Board.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u00b7 We have an Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d for additional information. \n \u00b7 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 Theodore L. Koenig, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board is also a manager of MC Advisors and the President and Chief Executive Officer of MC Management. Aaron D. Peck, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, is also a managing director of MC Management. \n \u00b7 We have a license agreement with Monroe Capital LLC, under which Monroe Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Monroe Capital\u201d for specified purposes in our business. \nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of MC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law.\n 57 \nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations for repayment as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unfunded commitments (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,323,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,323,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,523,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,323,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Unfunded commitments represent all amounts unfunded as of December 31, 2019. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2019. \nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments under undrawn revolvers, capital expenditure loans, delayed draw commitments and subscription agreements totaling $14,323,532. We believe that our available cash balances and/or ability to draw on the Credit Facility provide sufficient funds to cover our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, we have entered into certain contracts with other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, we have not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believe the risk of loss related to such indemnifications to be remote.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there has been a significant amount of capital raised over the past several years dedicated to middle market lending which has increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields and weaker financial covenants for new assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues including changes in bank regulations for middle-market banks has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through March 10, 2020, the date on which the consolidated financial statements were issued.\nOn January 2, 2020, we issued 2,036,841 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for proceeds of $20,368,410 pursuant to the Private Offering.\nOn March 6, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving and Security Agreement to extend the reinvestment period of our Credit Facility through April 10, 2020 as we negotiate a larger amendment to our Credit Facility.\n 58 \nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and then we amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. We record fees on loans based on the determination of whether the fee is considered a yield enhancement or payment for a service. If the fee is considered a yield enhancement associated with a funding of cash on a loan, the fee is generally deferred and recognized into interest income using the effective interest method if captured in the cost basis or using the straight-line method if the loan is unfunded and therefore there is no cost basis. If the fee is not considered a yield enhancement because a service was provided, and the fee is payment for that service, the fee is deemed earned and recognized as fee income in the period the service has been completed.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and LP investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nAs a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America to determine the fair value of the security. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available or whose market prices are not regularly updated are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u00b7 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of MC Advisors responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; \n \u00b7 our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. We will consult with independent valuation firm(s) relative to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year, but the independent appraisals are generally received quarterly; \n \u00b7 to the extent an independent valuation firm is not engaged to conduct an investment appraisal on an investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the investment will be valued by the MC Advisors investment professional responsible for the credit monitoring; \n \u00b7 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; \n \u00b7 the audit committee of our Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and MC Advisors adjusts or further supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee; and \n \u00b7 our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. \nWe generally use the income approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. This liquidation analysis may also include probability weighting of alternative outcomes. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner, the loan is in covenant compliance and is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, we consider fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the debt instrument.\n 59 \nUnder the income approach, discounted cash flow models are utilized to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the income approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, the enterprise value methodology is typically utilized to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nNet Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss\nWe measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gain or loss previously recognized. Net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gain or loss is realized. All fluctuations in fair value are included in net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreement). This fee equals 15% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $132,125 based on the performance of our portfolio, $775 of which was payable to MC Advisors as a result of realized gains. The remaining $131,350 was based on unrealized appreciation, none of which was payable to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nOrganization and Offering Costs and Expenses\nOrganization costs refer to the cost of organizing as a Maryland corporation, including, among other things, the cost of legal services, directors' fees and other fees, including travel-related expenses, pertaining to our organization. Offering costs include, among other things, legal fees and other costs pertaining to the preparation of our private placement memorandum and other offering documents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, MC Management has incurred organization and offering costs of approximately $418,925 on our behalf. MC Management has agreed to absorb and pay on our behalf up to $425,000 for organization and offering costs. If the expenses incurred by us are greater than $425,000, we will reimburse MC Management for organization and offering costs incurred on our behalf in excess of $425,000. As these costs have not exceeded the amount to be reimbursed by MC Management as of December 31, 2019, we have not recorded any such costs.\n 60 \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d). The primary objective of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements in the notes to the financial statements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, Fast Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, amending certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements and to provide for a consistent set of rules to govern incorporating information by reference and hyperlinking, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. We have adopted the final rule, as applicable, and determined the effect was limited to the modification and removal of certain disclosures."}
