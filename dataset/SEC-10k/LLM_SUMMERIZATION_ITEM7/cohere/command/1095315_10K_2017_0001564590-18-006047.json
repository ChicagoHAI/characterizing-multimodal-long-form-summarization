Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2015 and 2016 that affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquired the outstanding capital stock of Conexus Limited ( Conexus\u201d) on June 8, 2016.

The results of operations of Moda have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Completed an asset purchase agreement with CrossView, Inc. ( CrossView\u201d) and its shareholders on August 5, 2015. The results of operations of CrossView have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe derive our revenues from providing a broad range of services using three different seller services financial models: 1) the Service Fee model, 2) the Agent (or Flash) model and 3) the Retail model.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We derive our service fee revenues from a broad range of service offerings that include digital agency and marketing, eCommerce technologies, system integration, order management, customer care, logistics and fulfillment, financial management and professional consulting. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete ecommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We support clients in a wide array of industries, including fashion apparel and accessories, fragrance and beauty products, CPG, home furnishings and housewares, coins and collectibles, and technology products.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per-transaction basis, such as a per-labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nThe seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients' business and sales of their products. Accordingly, we must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability. We believe that with our current client\nmix and their current business volumes, our run rate service fee business activity will generally be highest during the quarter ended December 31. We believe our historical revenue pattern makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations. We believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.\nAgent (Flash) Model. As an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our Retail model allows us to purchase inventory from the client. In this model, we place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product upon delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership, although we have one client still utilizing the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nIn general, we provide the Service Fee model through all of our subsidiaries, the Agent (or Flash) model through our PFSweb and Supplies Distributors subsidiaries and the Retail model through our Supplies Distributors subsidiary.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our Service Fee and Agent models is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. We focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion and consumer packaged goods, which, by nature, require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our service offering capabilities and added new client relationships, which we currently expect to enhance our growth opportunities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue (product revenue net of cost of product revenue) in our consolidated statement of operations as opposed to product revenue as generated in the Agent or Flash model above. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nWe continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Supplies Distributors business and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\n2018 Update - Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company continued with its reorganization efforts to migrate from its current operating segments into two new operating segments, Professional Services and PFS Operations. As a result, we expect to report a change in our operating segments during 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented,

Service fee revenue increased $7.4 million, or 3.3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in service fee revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2017.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New service contract relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in existing client relationships and terminated client relationships not included in 2017 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $8.0 million, or 16.5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees increased to 33.6% in 2017 from 31.2% in 2016. In 2016, we incurred incremental facility, labor and other costs to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, in particular, for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. During 2017, we terminated our relationships with certain lower margin clients and were able to increase profit on other clients acquired in 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 16.1%, to $38.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease is directly attributable to the decrease in product revenue. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.2 million, or 5.3% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.8 million, or 5.8% of product revenue, for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $80.0 million, or 24.5% of total revenues in 2017 and $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016. The increase in the SG&A expense and percentage is primarily due to an increase in payroll-related expenses, including increases in incentive-based cash and stock compensation, and an increase in acquisition-related, restructuring and other costs.\nIncome Taxes. During 2017, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.1 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.1 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act\u201d). The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Reform Act; however, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118, Income Tax Account Implications of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB118), we have made reasonable estimates when possible.\nWe remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our income statement related to tax amortization of goodwill. The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that we previously deferred from US income taxes. We have not yet completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. However, based on our estimate we believe there is a net deficit E&P and, therefore, have not recorded any liabilities related to this tax.\nThe preliminary net tax effects recorded may differ in the future due to changes in the interpretations of the Tax Reform Act, legislative action, and changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the tax impact. We expect to finalize the tax analysis related to the Tax Reform Act with the filing of our tax return and record any differences between the final and provisional amounts in the 2018 fourth quarter at that time, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nService fee revenue. Service fee revenue increased $44.0 million, or 24.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in service fee revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, including service fee revenues generated by our acquired subsidiaries Moda beginning in June 2015, CrossView beginning in August 2015 and Conexus beginning in June 2016, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2016.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New service contract relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in existing client service fee relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Terminated client relationships not included in 2016 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year. The growth of existing client relationships in 2016 includes the benefit of a full period of client activity applicable to client relationships acquired in conjunction with the Moda acquisition in June 2015 and CrossView acquisition in August 2015, compared to only a partial period of revenue in 2015. The new service contract relationships include an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million of revenue applicable to Conexus, acquired in June 2016.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 17.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees decreased to 31.2% in 2016 from 32.2% in 2015. During 2016 we implemented three new, large fulfillment solutions in the U.S. along with several other engagements. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to incremental facility, labor and other costs incurred to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, especially for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. The impact of these higher labor and operating costs was partially offset by the benefit of higher margin project activity and higher margin professional services activity, including our agency and technology services, which have been further bolstered by our acquisitions of Moda and Crossview in mid-2015 and Conexus in June 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $9.7 million, or 17.5%, to $45.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.8 million or 5.8% of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.1 million or 5.2% of product revenue for 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016 and $66.3 million, or 23.0% of total revenues in 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 includes $13.1 million of SG&A expenses for our newly consolidated acquisitions, Moda, CrossView and Conexus (including $3.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets), which were either not yet acquired as of December 31, 2015 or not included for the full year 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.2 million of SG&A expenses for Moda and CrossView (including $1.9 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets) and $0.4 million of expense related to the settlement of a claim relating to a discontinued business in 2015. SG&A expenses for 2016 and 2015 include approximately $3.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively of restructuring and acquisition related charges and approximately $4.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively of amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Excluding the restructuring and acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles assets in 2016 and 2015 and the claim settlement in 2015, SG&A expenses were 21.0% and 20.0% of total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining increase in the SG&A percentage is primarily due to increases in personnel to support our professional services business activity related expenses, as well as sales and marketing activities and facility costs to support our growth, partially offset by a reduction in incentive based cash and stock compensation.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and the majority of our international operations. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets. We also recorded a deferred tax provision associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition.\nSupplies Distributors and its Subsidiaries\nWe conduct a portion of our Retail business model operations through Supplies Distributors, which act as a distributor/reseller of various Ricoh and other products. We conduct these services through transaction management services agreements under which PFS provides transaction management and fulfillment services to Supplies Distributors. In addition, we have also provided Supplies Distributors with a subordinated loan that, as of December 31, 2017, had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million.\nSupplies Distributors paid us dividends of $1.7 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which eliminate in consolidation. Supplies Distributors has received lender approval to pay dividends of approximately $1.7 million in 2018, provided that no distribution may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries would be in noncompliance with its financial covenants under its current facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2017 primarily from using cash generated from operations to make capital expenditures, payments for acquisition-related contingencies, and to service debt obligations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash income from operations before working capital changes was $14.7 million, compared to $11.2 million in 2016 and $12.0 in 2015. In addition, we received cash flow benefits due to decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other receivables and other assets, as well as inventories, the latter decrease caused by the reduction of our Ricoh related product revenue business. The above cash proceeds were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.7 million, $8.7 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nIn 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities included initial cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8.4 million in 2016 for Conexus, and $31.6 million in 2015 for Moda and CrossView.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2017, cash used in financing activities was $14.7 million, primarily related to repayments on our debt and capital lease obligations and performance-based contingent payments, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving loan. In each of the years 2016 and 2015, cash flows from financing activities of $7.0 million and $18.6 million, respectively, were primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt, net of debt and capital lease payments and performance-based contingent payments related to our recent acquisitions.\nPayments made in relation to performance-based contingent payments were $2.0 million paid in 2017 for CrossView 2016 performance-based contingent payments, $9.5 million paid in 2016 for REV Solutions, Inc. and REVTECH Solutions India Private Limited (collectively REV\u201d), LiveAreaLabs, Inc. ( LAL\u201d) and CrossView 2015 performance-based contingent payments and $2.0 million paid in 2015 for REV and LAL 2014 performance-based contingent payments.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2017, our working capital decreased to $13.7 million from $18.6 million at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by (i) $11.5 million net reduction of long-term debt, (ii) $3.0 million reduction of capital lease obligations, and (iii) $4.7 million used to purchase property and equipment, offset by income from operations before working capital changes.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $13.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice. The Company has direct vendor credit terms with Ricoh to finance Supplies Distributors European subsidiary's inventory purchases.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $2.5 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nIn January 2018, Supplies Distributors entered into Amendment No. 19 to the IBM Credit Facility. The Amended IBM Credit Facility adjusts the minimum borrowing under the facility from $13.0 million to $11.0 million and lowers the minimum PFS Subordinated Note receivable PFSweb is required to maintain from $2.5 million to $1.0 million.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself, Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under this Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders have agreed to provide a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we have the ability to increase the total loan facilities to $75 million. Availability under the revolving loan facility, which was approximately $19.3 million as of December 31, 2017, may not exceed a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable (as defined). Advances under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and have a five year maturity, with scheduled amortization payments for term loan advances. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon our ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. In June 2016, PFSweb also entered into a Master Agreement with Regions Bank to provide equipment loans financing for certain capital expenditures.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than performance-based contingent payments applicable to our CrossView acquisition, and our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants / Restricted Net Assets\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had restricted net assets of approximately $63.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a schedule of our total contractual cash obligations, which is comprised of debt, performance-based contingent payments, operating leases and capital leases (including interest), as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nTable 104: <table></table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance-based\ncontingent payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, As Amended ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application with disclosure of results under the new and old standards for the first year of adoption.\nThe Company will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the modified retrospective transition method, the Company will calculate and record the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard at January 1, 2018 for all open contracts, in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018.\nBased on its evaluation process, the Company has identified certain potential areas of impact. Application of the new standard requires that incremental costs of obtaining a contract (including sales commissions plus any associated fringe benefits) be recognized as an asset and expensed over the expected life of the arrangement. Currently the Company expenses certain contract acquisition costs as incurred. Under the new standard the Company will defer incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortize those costs over the period of benefit. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a policy election, sales commissions related to contracts less than one year to be expensed as incurred instead of capitalized, as a practical expedient. The Company has elected this practical expedient. Therefore, only commissions related to contracts greater than one year will be capitalized.\nAdditionally, the Company has reviewed the way it manages volume tiered discounts and penalties. Currently, revenue adjustments are recorded as discounts or penalties when incurred. Under ASU 2014-09, these items will be treated as variable consideration and good faith estimates will be made up front, which will have the impact of reducing some of the revenue. Variable consideration will be reassessed quarterly.\nContract modifications under prior guidance were handled as modifications, if the adjustment was for additional hours on time and materials contracts, which were adjusted and charged as work is performed monthly. Under ASU 2014-09, we will continue to account for large scope changes with significant additional distinct services with related price increases that reflect our stand-alone selling price of the scope change as separate contracts. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a transition practical expedient, for contracts modified prior to the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented under the new standard (January 1, 2018 for the Company), an entity can reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented under the new standard when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. We are electing this practical expedient.\nBased on contracts in process at December 31, 2017, the Company expects to record, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, a net cumulative adjustment to shareholders' equity not to exceed $1.0 million. The adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the modification of the amortization of implementation related deferred revenues and costs. Sales commissions were not a material amount for open contracts at December 31, 2017 and, therefore, will not have an impact at adoption.\nThe Company will make certain presentation changes on its consolidated balance sheet to comply with the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently assessing the ASU's impact on our consolidated financial statements, but do expect the adoption to have a material impact to the balance sheet through the addition of an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include - debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2017-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2017-04.\nOn May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,\u201d ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. ASU 2017-09 requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. ASU 2017-09 is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-09 is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as it is not the Company's practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, product\nshipment or delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. We consider several factors to determine whether we are a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the vendor or customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks, if applicable.\nOur service fee revenue relates to our distribution services, order management/customer care services, professional, digital agency and technology services. Distribution services relate primarily to inventory management, product receiving, warehousing and fulfillment (i.e., picking, packing and shipping product on our clients' behalf). Order management/customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients' products via various channels such as telephone call-center, electronic or facsimile. These services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders, as well as cross-selling/up-selling activities. Professional and technology services relate primarily to design, implementation and support of eCommerce platforms, website solutions and quality control for our clients.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we may charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours.\nWe evaluate our contractual arrangements to determine whether or not they include multiple service elements. Revenue recognition is determined for the separate service elements of the contract in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no return rights or other contingencies present for the delivered elements. We allocate revenue to each element based on estimated selling price. Each of our client contracts, and the related services, is unique, with individual needs and criteria customized for each client. Each client engagement is scoped and priced separately and as such we are not able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our services, nor is third-party evidence available to establish stand-alone selling prices. Accordingly we use our best estimate of selling price for the deliverables. We establish our estimates considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls as well as market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies.\nWe perform front-end set-up and integration services to support client eCommerce platforms and websites. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, we defer the start-up fees received and the related costs, and recognize them over the expected performance period. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, for time and material arrangements, we recognize revenue as services are rendered and costs as they are incurred. For fixed-price arrangements, we use the completed contract method to recognize revenues and costs if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made. If reasonable and reliable costs estimates for a project can be made, we recognize revenue over the expected performance period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual effort incurred compared to the estimated total contract effort. We use this method because we consider effort incurred to date to be the best available measure of progress on contract in progress. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts, if any, are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change orders that result from modification of an original contract are taken into consideration for revenue recognition when they result in a change of total contract value and are approved by our clients.\nDepending on the terms of the customer arrangement, product revenue is recognized either upon shipment of the product or when the customer receives the product. Product revenue is reported net of estimated returns and allowances, which are estimated based upon historical return information. Management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates. If actual sales returns, allowances and discounts are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue\nOur cost of service fee revenue represents the cost to provide the services described above, primarily compensation and related expenses and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing the services. These also include certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses. Certain of these costs are allocated from general and administrative expenses. For these allocations, we estimate the amount of direct expenses based on client-specific information, such as the number of transactions processed. We believe our allocation methodology is reasonable, however a change in assumptions would result in a different gross profit in our statement of operations, yet no change to the resulting net income or loss.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our clients and customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate. Inherently, these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers' ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. These provisions may be based on discussions with the client or customer or the age of the amount due.\nIn our Retail model, we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from inventory returns to vendors, vendor rebates, price protections and other promotions. We determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history and vendor communication. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient, an additional allowance may be required.\nWe believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories (merchandise, held for resale, all of which are finished goods) are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries assume responsibility for slow-moving inventory under certain distributor agreements, subject to certain termination rights, but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes, as defined. We review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis, but at a minimum, annually. Recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. If write-downs of inventories are necessary, the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. We believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nStock Compensation\nWe utilize our Employee Stock and Incentive Plan (the Employee Plan\u201d) to help attract, retain and incentivize qualified executives, key employees and non-employee directors to increase our shareholder value and help build and sustain growth. The Employee Plan provides for the granting of incentive awards in a variety of forms, such as the award of an option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, among other stock-based awards.\nCompensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Depending on the conditions associated with the vesting of the award, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line or graded basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of each award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For certain of the awards that have a market condition, we estimate the compensation cost using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The estimated fair value for awards involves assumptions for expected dividend yield, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and the expected life of the award.\nIf, in the future, we determine that another method of estimating an award's fair value is more reasonable, or, if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our stock-based compensation could change significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to their net realizable value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material.\nBecause we operate in multiple countries, we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets and liabilities to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future financial performance the acquired entity. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of an acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Costs associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed in the period incurred.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, intangible assets, goodwill and certain other assets. We make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. Additionally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of year-end. We record impairment losses in the period in which we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This may require us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review.\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- In this

You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to the Risk Factors set forth above or elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include:\n \u2022 our ability to retain and expand relationships with existing clients and attract and implement new clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on the fees generated by the transaction volume, product sales and technology and agency projects and support of our clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on our clients' projections or transaction volume or product sales; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM\u201d) and Ricoh; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with our major clients; \n \u2022 our client mix, their business volumes and the seasonality of their business; \n \u2022 our ability to finalize pending client and customer contracts; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic alliances and acquisitions; \n \u2022 trends in e-commerce, outsourcing, government regulation, both foreign and domestic, and the market for our services; \n \u2022 whether we can continue and manage growth; \n \u2022 increased competition; \n \u2022 our ability to generate more revenue and achieve sustainable profitability; \n \u2022 effects of changes in profit margins; \n \u2022 the customer and supplier concentration of our business; \n \u2022 our reliance on third-party providers and other subcontracted services; \n \u2022 the unknown effects of possible system failures and rapid changes in technology; \n \u2022 foreign currency risks and other risks of operating in foreign countries; \n \u2022 potential litigation; \n \u2022 our dependency upon key personnel; \n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain seasonal and temporary workers; \n \u2022 the impact of new accounting standards and changes in existing accounting rules or the interpretations of those rules; \n \u2022 our ability to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing; \n \u2022 our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to borrow under current financing arrangements and maintain compliance with debt covenants; \n \u2022 our relationship with, and our guarantees of, certain of the liabilities and indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 taxation on the sale of our products and provision of our services. \nWe have based these statements on our current expectations about future events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2015 and 2016 that affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Acquired the outstanding capital stock of Conexus Limited ( Conexus\u201d) on June 8, 2016. The results of operations of Conexus have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \nYear ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 Acquired the outstanding capital stock of Moda Superbe Limited ( Moda\u201d) on June 11, 2015. The results of operations of Moda have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \n \u2022 Completed an asset purchase agreement with CrossView, Inc. ( CrossView\u201d) and its shareholders on August 5, 2015. The results of operations of CrossView have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \nOverview\nWe derive our revenues from providing a broad range of services using three different seller services financial models: 1) the Service Fee model, 2) the Agent (or Flash) model and 3) the Retail model.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We derive our service fee revenues from a broad range of service offerings that include digital agency and marketing, eCommerce technologies, system integration, order management, customer care, logistics and fulfillment, financial management and professional consulting. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete ecommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We support clients in a wide array of industries, including fashion apparel and accessories, fragrance and beauty products, CPG, home furnishings and housewares, coins and collectibles, and technology products.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per-transaction basis, such as a per-labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nThe seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients' business and sales of their products. Accordingly, we must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability. We believe that with our current client\nmix and their current business volumes, our run rate service fee business activity will generally be highest during the quarter ended December 31. We believe our historical revenue pattern makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations. We believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.\nAgent (Flash) Model. As an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our Retail model allows us to purchase inventory from the client. In this model, we place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product upon delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership, although we have one client still utilizing the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nIn general, we provide the Service Fee model through all of our subsidiaries, the Agent (or Flash) model through our PFSweb and Supplies Distributors subsidiaries and the Retail model through our Supplies Distributors subsidiary.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our Service Fee and Agent models is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. We focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion and consumer packaged goods, which, by nature, require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our service offering capabilities and added new client relationships, which we currently expect to enhance our growth opportunities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue (product revenue net of cost of product revenue) in our consolidated statement of operations as opposed to product revenue as generated in the Agent or Flash model above. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nWe continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Supplies Distributors business and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\n2018 Update - Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company continued with its reorganization efforts to migrate from its current operating segments into two new operating segments, Professional Services and PFS Operations. As a result, we expect to report a change in our operating segments during 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented, expressed in terms of dollars, dollar change, percentage change and as a percentage of total revenue (in millions).\n\n (1) Represents the percent of Service fee revenue. \n (2) Represents the percent of Product revenue, net. \n (3) Represents the percent of Pass-through revenue. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nService fee revenue. Service fee revenue increased $7.4 million, or 3.3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in service fee revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2017.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\n\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $8.0 million, or 16.5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees increased to 33.6% in 2017 from 31.2% in 2016. In 2016, we incurred incremental facility, labor and other costs to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, in particular, for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. During 2017, we terminated our relationships with certain lower margin clients and were able to increase profit on other clients acquired in 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 16.1%, to $38.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease is directly attributable to the decrease in product revenue. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.2 million, or 5.3% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.8 million, or 5.8% of product revenue, for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $80.0 million, or 24.5% of total revenues in 2017 and $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016. The increase in the SG&A expense and percentage is primarily due to an increase in payroll-related expenses, including increases in incentive-based cash and stock compensation, and an increase in acquisition-related, restructuring and other costs.\nIncome Taxes. During 2017, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.1 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.1 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act\u201d). The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Reform Act; however, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118, Income Tax Account Implications of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB118), we have made reasonable estimates when possible.\nWe remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our income statement related to tax amortization of goodwill. The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that we previously deferred from US income taxes. We have not yet completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. However, based on our estimate we believe there is a net deficit E&P and, therefore, have not recorded any liabilities related to this tax.\nThe preliminary net tax effects recorded may differ in the future due to changes in the interpretations of the Tax Reform Act, legislative action, and changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the tax impact. We expect to finalize the tax analysis related to the Tax Reform Act with the filing of our tax return and record any differences between the final and provisional amounts in the 2018 fourth quarter at that time, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nService fee revenue. Service fee revenue increased $44.0 million, or 24.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in service fee revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, including service fee revenues generated by our acquired subsidiaries Moda beginning in June 2015, CrossView beginning in August 2015 and Conexus beginning in June 2016, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2016.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\n\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year. The growth of existing client relationships in 2016 includes the benefit of a full period of client activity applicable to client relationships acquired in conjunction with the Moda acquisition in June 2015 and CrossView acquisition in August 2015, compared to only a partial period of revenue in 2015. The new service contract relationships include an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million of revenue applicable to Conexus, acquired in June 2016.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 17.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees decreased to 31.2% in 2016 from 32.2% in 2015. During 2016 we implemented three new, large fulfillment solutions in the U.S. along with several other engagements. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to incremental facility, labor and other costs incurred to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, especially for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. The impact of these higher labor and operating costs was partially offset by the benefit of higher margin project activity and higher margin professional services activity, including our agency and technology services, which have been further bolstered by our acquisitions of Moda and Crossview in mid-2015 and Conexus in June 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $9.7 million, or 17.5%, to $45.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.8 million or 5.8% of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.1 million or 5.2% of product revenue for 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016 and $66.3 million, or 23.0% of total revenues in 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 includes $13.1 million of SG&A expenses for our newly consolidated acquisitions, Moda, CrossView and Conexus (including $3.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets), which were either not yet acquired as of December 31, 2015 or not included for the full year 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.2 million of SG&A expenses for Moda and CrossView (including $1.9 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets) and $0.4 million of expense related to the settlement of a claim relating to a discontinued business in 2015. SG&A expenses for 2016 and 2015 include approximately $3.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively of restructuring and acquisition related charges and approximately $4.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively of amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Excluding the restructuring and acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles assets in 2016 and 2015 and the claim settlement in 2015, SG&A expenses were 21.0% and 20.0% of total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining increase in the SG&A percentage is primarily due to increases in personnel to support our professional services business activity related expenses, as well as sales and marketing activities and facility costs to support our growth, partially offset by a reduction in incentive based cash and stock compensation.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and the majority of our international operations. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets. We also recorded a deferred tax provision associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition.\nSupplies Distributors and its Subsidiaries\nWe conduct a portion of our Retail business model operations through Supplies Distributors, which act as a distributor/reseller of various Ricoh and other products. We conduct these services through transaction management services agreements under which PFS provides transaction management and fulfillment services to Supplies Distributors. In addition, we have also provided Supplies Distributors with a subordinated loan that, as of December 31, 2017, had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million.\nSupplies Distributors paid us dividends of $1.7 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which eliminate in consolidation. Supplies Distributors has received lender approval to pay dividends of approximately $1.7 million in 2018, provided that no distribution may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries would be in noncompliance with its financial covenants under its current facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2017 primarily from using cash generated from operations to make capital expenditures, payments for acquisition-related contingencies, and to service debt obligations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash income from operations before working capital changes was $14.7 million, compared to $11.2 million in 2016 and $12.0 in 2015. In addition, we received cash flow benefits due to decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other receivables and other assets, as well as inventories, the latter decrease caused by the reduction of our Ricoh related product revenue business. The above cash proceeds were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.7 million, $8.7 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nIn 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities included initial cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8.4 million in 2016 for Conexus, and $31.6 million in 2015 for Moda and CrossView.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2017, cash used in financing activities was $14.7 million, primarily related to repayments on our debt and capital lease obligations and performance-based contingent payments, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving loan. In each of the years 2016 and 2015, cash flows from financing activities of $7.0 million and $18.6 million, respectively, were primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt, net of debt and capital lease payments and performance-based contingent payments related to our recent acquisitions.\nPayments made in relation to performance-based contingent payments were $2.0 million paid in 2017 for CrossView 2016 performance-based contingent payments, $9.5 million paid in 2016 for REV Solutions, Inc. and REVTECH Solutions India Private Limited (collectively REV\u201d), LiveAreaLabs, Inc. ( LAL\u201d) and CrossView 2015 performance-based contingent payments and $2.0 million paid in 2015 for REV and LAL 2014 performance-based contingent payments.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2017, our working capital decreased to $13.7 million from $18.6 million at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by (i) $11.5 million net reduction of long-term debt, (ii) $3.0 million reduction of capital lease obligations, and (iii) $4.7 million used to purchase property and equipment, offset by income from operations before working capital changes.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $13.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice. The Company has direct vendor credit terms with Ricoh to finance Supplies Distributors European subsidiary's inventory purchases.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $2.5 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nIn January 2018, Supplies Distributors entered into Amendment No. 19 to the IBM Credit Facility. The Amended IBM Credit Facility adjusts the minimum borrowing under the facility from $13.0 million to $11.0 million and lowers the minimum PFS Subordinated Note receivable PFSweb is required to maintain from $2.5 million to $1.0 million.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself, Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under this Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders have agreed to provide a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we have the ability to increase the total loan facilities to $75 million. Availability under the revolving loan facility, which was approximately $19.3 million as of December 31, 2017, may not exceed a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable (as defined). Advances under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and have a five year maturity, with scheduled amortization payments for term loan advances. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon our ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. In June 2016, PFSweb also entered into a Master Agreement with Regions Bank to provide equipment loans financing for certain capital expenditures.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than performance-based contingent payments applicable to our CrossView acquisition, and our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants / Restricted Net Assets\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had restricted net assets of approximately $63.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a schedule of our total contractual cash obligations, which is comprised of debt, performance-based contingent payments, operating leases and capital leases (including interest), as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\n \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, As Amended ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application with disclosure of results under the new and old standards for the first year of adoption.\nThe Company will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the modified retrospective transition method, the Company will calculate and record the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard at January 1, 2018 for all open contracts, in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018.\nBased on its evaluation process, the Company has identified certain potential areas of impact. Application of the new standard requires that incremental costs of obtaining a contract (including sales commissions plus any associated fringe benefits) be recognized as an asset and expensed over the expected life of the arrangement. Currently the Company expenses certain contract acquisition costs as incurred. Under the new standard the Company will defer incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortize those costs over the period of benefit. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a policy election, sales commissions related to contracts less than one year to be expensed as incurred instead of capitalized, as a practical expedient. The Company has elected this practical expedient. Therefore, only commissions related to contracts greater than one year will be capitalized.\nAdditionally, the Company has reviewed the way it manages volume tiered discounts and penalties. Currently, revenue adjustments are recorded as discounts or penalties when incurred. Under ASU 2014-09, these items will be treated as variable consideration and good faith estimates will be made up front, which will have the impact of reducing some of the revenue. Variable consideration will be reassessed quarterly.\nContract modifications under prior guidance were handled as modifications, if the adjustment was for additional hours on time and materials contracts, which were adjusted and charged as work is performed monthly. Under ASU 2014-09, we will continue to account for large scope changes with significant additional distinct services with related price increases that reflect our stand-alone selling price of the scope change as separate contracts. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a transition practical expedient, for contracts modified prior to the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented under the new standard (January 1, 2018 for the Company), an entity can reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented under the new standard when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. We are electing this practical expedient.\nBased on contracts in process at December 31, 2017, the Company expects to record, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, a net cumulative adjustment to shareholders' equity not to exceed $1.0 million. The adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the modification of the amortization of implementation related deferred revenues and costs. Sales commissions were not a material amount for open contracts at December 31, 2017 and, therefore, will not have an impact at adoption.\nThe Company will make certain presentation changes on its consolidated balance sheet to comply with the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently assessing the ASU's impact on our consolidated financial statements, but do expect the adoption to have a material impact to the balance sheet through the addition of an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include - debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2017-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2017-04.\nOn May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,\u201d ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. ASU 2017-09 requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. ASU 2017-09 is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-09 is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as it is not the Company's practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, product\nshipment or delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. We consider several factors to determine whether we are a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the vendor or customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks, if applicable.\nOur service fee revenue relates to our distribution services, order management/customer care services, professional, digital agency and technology services. Distribution services relate primarily to inventory management, product receiving, warehousing and fulfillment (i.e., picking, packing and shipping product on our clients' behalf). Order management/customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients' products via various channels such as telephone call-center, electronic or facsimile. These services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders, as well as cross-selling/up-selling activities. Professional and technology services relate primarily to design, implementation and support of eCommerce platforms, website solutions and quality control for our clients.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we may charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours.\nWe evaluate our contractual arrangements to determine whether or not they include multiple service elements. Revenue recognition is determined for the separate service elements of the contract in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no return rights or other contingencies present for the delivered elements. We allocate revenue to each element based on estimated selling price. Each of our client contracts, and the related services, is unique, with individual needs and criteria customized for each client. Each client engagement is scoped and priced separately and as such we are not able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our services, nor is third-party evidence available to establish stand-alone selling prices. Accordingly we use our best estimate of selling price for the deliverables. We establish our estimates considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls as well as market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies.\nWe perform front-end set-up and integration services to support client eCommerce platforms and websites. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, we defer the start-up fees received and the related costs, and recognize them over the expected performance period. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, for time and material arrangements, we recognize revenue as services are rendered and costs as they are incurred. For fixed-price arrangements, we use the completed contract method to recognize revenues and costs if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made. If reasonable and reliable costs estimates for a project can be made, we recognize revenue over the expected performance period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual effort incurred compared to the estimated total contract effort. We use this method because we consider effort incurred to date to be the best available measure of progress on contract in progress. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts, if any, are made in the period in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the following discussion and analysis provides information that is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and there can be no guarantee that these statements will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements include assumptions as to how we may perform in the future. When we use words like seek,\u201d strive,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d continue,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d could,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d target,\u201d project\u201d and estimate\u201d or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to the Risk Factors set forth above or elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include:\n \u2022 our ability to retain and expand relationships with existing clients and attract and implement new clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on the fees generated by the transaction volume, product sales and technology and agency projects and support of our clients; \n \u2022 our reliance on our clients' projections or transaction volume or product sales; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM\u201d) and Ricoh; \n \u2022 our dependency upon our agreements with our major clients; \n \u2022 our client mix, their business volumes and the seasonality of their business; \n \u2022 our ability to finalize pending client and customer contracts; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic alliances and acquisitions; \n \u2022 trends in e-commerce, outsourcing, government regulation, both foreign and domestic, and the market for our services; \n \u2022 whether we can continue and manage growth; \n \u2022 increased competition; \n \u2022 our ability to generate more revenue and achieve sustainable profitability; \n \u2022 effects of changes in profit margins; \n \u2022 the customer and supplier concentration of our business; \n \u2022 our reliance on third-party providers and other subcontracted services; \n \u2022 the unknown effects of possible system failures and rapid changes in technology; \n \u2022 foreign currency risks and other risks of operating in foreign countries; \n \u2022 potential litigation; \n \u2022 our dependency upon key personnel; \n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain seasonal and temporary workers; \n \u2022 the impact of new accounting standards and changes in existing accounting rules or the interpretations of those rules; \n \u2022 our ability to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing; \n \u2022 our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to borrow under current financing arrangements and maintain compliance with debt covenants; \n \u2022 our relationship with, and our guarantees of, certain of the liabilities and indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and \n \u2022 taxation on the sale of our products and provision of our services. \nWe have based these statements on our current expectations about future events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these expectations will actually be achieved. In addition, some forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expected or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. There may be additional risks we do not currently view as material or that are not presently known. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Transactions and Events\nWe were impacted by the following key transactions and events in 2015 and 2016 that affect comparability of our results to 2017 and other periods:\nYear ended December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 Acquired the outstanding capital stock of Conexus Limited ( Conexus\u201d) on June 8, 2016. The results of operations of Conexus have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \nYear ended December 31, 2015:\n \u2022 Acquired the outstanding capital stock of Moda Superbe Limited ( Moda\u201d) on June 11, 2015. The results of operations of Moda have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \n \u2022 Completed an asset purchase agreement with CrossView, Inc. ( CrossView\u201d) and its shareholders on August 5, 2015. The results of operations of CrossView have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. \nOverview\nWe derive our revenues from providing a broad range of services using three different seller services financial models: 1) the Service Fee model, 2) the Agent (or Flash) model and 3) the Retail model.\nService Fee Model. We refer to our standard seller services financial model as the Service Fee model. In this model, our clients own the inventory and are the merchants of record and engage us to provide various infrastructure, technology and digital agency services in support of their business operations. We derive our service fee revenues from a broad range of service offerings that include digital agency and marketing, eCommerce technologies, system integration, order management, customer care, logistics and fulfillment, financial management and professional consulting. We offer our services as an integrated solution, which enables our clients to outsource their complete ecommerce needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies, though clients are also able to select individual or groupings of our various service offerings on an \u00e0 la carte basis. We support clients in a wide array of industries, including fashion apparel and accessories, fragrance and beauty products, CPG, home furnishings and housewares, coins and collectibles, and technology products.\nIn the Service Fee model, we typically charge for our services on a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services or a per-transaction basis, such as a per-labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services and a per-item basis for fulfillment services. Additional fees are billed for other services. We price our services based on a variety of factors, including the depth and complexity of the services provided, the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required, the length of contract and other factors.\nMany of our service fee contracts involve third-party vendors who provide additional services, such as package delivery. The costs we are charged by these third-party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients. Our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other \u2018out-of-pocket' expenses include travel, shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass-through revenue.\nThe seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients' business and sales of their products. Accordingly, we must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability. We believe that with our current client\nmix and their current business volumes, our run rate service fee business activity will generally be highest during the quarter ended December 31. We believe our historical revenue pattern makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations. We believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.\nAgent (Flash) Model. As an additional service, we offer the Agent, or Flash, financial model, in which our clients maintain ownership of the product inventory stored at our locations as in the Service Fee model. When a customer orders the product from our clients, a flash\u201d sale transaction passes product ownership to us for each order and we in turn immediately re-sell the product to the customer. The flash\u201d ownership exchange establishes us as the merchant of record, which enables us to use our existing merchant infrastructure to process sales to end customers, removing the need for the clients to establish these business processes internally, but permitting them to control the sales process to end customers. In this model, based on the terms of our current client arrangements, we record product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRetail Model. Our Retail model allows us to purchase inventory from the client. In this model, we place the initial and replenishment purchase orders with the client and take ownership of the product upon delivery to our facility. In this model, depending on the terms of our client arrangements, we may own the inventory and the accounts receivable arising from our product sales. Under the Retail model, depending upon the product category and sales characteristics, we may require the client to provide product price protection as well as product purchase payment terms, right of return, and obsolescence protection appropriate to the product sales profile. Depending on the terms of our client arrangements in the Retail model, we record in our consolidated statement of operations either: 1) product revenue as a component of product revenue, or 2) product revenue net of cost of product revenue as a component of service fee revenue. In general, we seek to structure client relationships in our Retail model under the net revenue approach to more closely align with our service fee revenue financial presentation and mitigate inventory ownership, although we have one client still utilizing the gross revenue approach. Freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue. This business model generally requires significant working capital, for which we have credit available either through credit terms provided by our clients or under senior credit facilities.\nIn general, we provide the Service Fee model through all of our subsidiaries, the Agent (or Flash) model through our PFSweb and Supplies Distributors subsidiaries and the Retail model through our Supplies Distributors subsidiary.\nGrowth is a key element to achieving our future goals, including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability. Growth in our Service Fee and Agent models is driven by two main elements: new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients. We focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand-name companies within four primary target markets, health and beauty, home goods and collectibles, fashion and consumer packaged goods, which, by nature, require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements. Through recent acquisitions, we have expanded our service offering capabilities and added new client relationships, which we currently expect to enhance our growth opportunities.\nCurrently, we are targeting growth within our Retail model to be through relationships with clients under which we can record service fee revenue (product revenue net of cost of product revenue) in our consolidated statement of operations as opposed to product revenue as generated in the Agent or Flash model above. These relationships are often driven by the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners. In addition, as a result of certain operational restructuring of its business, our primary client relationship operating in the Retail model, Ricoh, has implemented, and will continue to implement, certain changes in the sale and distribution of Ricoh products. The changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in reduced product revenues and profitability under our Retail model.\nWe continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability. While we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield incremental gross profit, we also expect to incur incremental investments in technology development, operational and support management and sales and marketing expenses to help generate growth.\nOur expenses comprise primarily four categories: 1) cost of service fee revenue, 2) cost of product revenue, 3) cost of pass-through revenue and 4) selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of service fee revenue - consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web-enabled customer contact center services, international fulfillment and distribution services and professional, digital agency and technology services, and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nCost of product revenue - consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs, which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses. These reimbursable expenses include pass-through customer marketing programs, direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids, the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the distributor agreements.\nCost of pass-through revenue - the related reimbursable costs for pass-through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass-through revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses - consist of expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff, distribution costs (excluding freight) applicable to the Supplies Distributors business and the Retail model, executive, management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs, including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses and acquisition related costs.\nMonitoring and controlling our available cash balances and our expenses continues to be a primary focus. Our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth.\n2018 Update - Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company continued with its reorganization efforts to migrate from its current operating segments into two new operating segments, Professional Services and PFS Operations. As a result, we expect to report a change in our operating segments during 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented,

Product revenue, net. \n (3) Represents the percent of Pass-through revenue. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nService fee revenue. Service fee revenue increased $7.4 million, or 3.3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in service fee revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2017.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New service contract relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in existing client relationships and terminated client relationships not included in 2017 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $8.0 million, or 16.5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees increased to 33.6% in 2017 from 31.2% in 2016. In 2016, we incurred incremental facility, labor and other costs to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, in particular, for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. During 2017, we terminated our relationships with certain lower margin clients and were able to increase profit on other clients acquired in 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 16.1%, to $38.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease is directly attributable to the decrease in product revenue. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.2 million, or 5.3% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.8 million, or 5.8% of product revenue, for 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $80.0 million, or 24.5% of total revenues in 2017 and $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016. The increase in the SG&A expense and percentage is primarily due to an increase in payroll-related expenses, including increases in incentive-based cash and stock compensation, and an increase in acquisition-related, restructuring and other costs.\nIncome Taxes. During 2017, we recorded a tax provision comprised primarily of $1.1 million related to the majority of our international operations, $0.6 million related to state income taxes, and $0.1 million associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act\u201d). The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Reform Act; however, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118, Income Tax Account Implications of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (SAB118), we have made reasonable estimates when possible.\nWe remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $12.1 million that was mostly offset by a change in the valuation allowance except for a $0.6 million benefit that was recorded to our income statement related to tax amortization of goodwill. The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that we previously deferred from US income taxes. We have not yet completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. However, based on our estimate we believe there is a net deficit E&P and, therefore, have not recorded any liabilities related to this tax.\nThe preliminary net tax effects recorded may differ in the future due to changes in the interpretations of the Tax Reform Act, legislative action, and changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the tax impact. We expect to finalize the tax analysis related to the Tax Reform Act with the filing of our tax return and record any differences between the final and provisional amounts in the 2018 fourth quarter at that time, if any.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nService fee revenue. Service fee revenue increased $44.0 million, or 24.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in service fee revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of expanded and new client relationships, including service fee revenues generated by our acquired subsidiaries Moda beginning in June 2015, CrossView beginning in August 2015 and Conexus beginning in June 2016, partially offset by the conclusion or reduction of operations of certain client programs during 2016.\nThe change in service fee revenue, excluding pass-through revenue, is shown below ($ millions):\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New service contract relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in existing client service fee relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Terminated client relationships not included in 2016 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 226.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen considering client relationships, we define an existing client to be a client from whom we earned revenue in both the current and prior year; we define a new client to be a client from whom we only earned revenue in the current year; and we define a terminated client as a client from whom we only earned revenue in the prior year. The growth of existing client relationships in 2016 includes the benefit of a full period of client activity applicable to client relationships acquired in conjunction with the Moda acquisition in June 2015 and CrossView acquisition in August 2015, compared to only a partial period of revenue in 2015. The new service contract relationships include an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million of revenue applicable to Conexus, acquired in June 2016.\nProduct revenue, net. Product revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 17.0%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. This reduction in revenue was primarily due to the operational restructuring by Ricoh of its business, including discontinuance of certain product lines, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in lower product revenue from the sale of Ricoh products.\nCost of Service Fee Revenue. Service fee gross profit as a percentage of service fees decreased to 31.2% in 2016 from 32.2% in 2015. During 2016 we implemented three new, large fulfillment solutions in the U.S. along with several other engagements. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to incremental facility, labor and other costs incurred to support the setup and launch of new client relationships, especially for certain of these new clients whose unique business models led to unanticipated operational requirements requiring remediation to the solutions while also supporting the clients' seasonal peak. The impact of these higher labor and operating costs was partially offset by the benefit of higher margin project activity and higher margin professional services activity, including our agency and technology services, which have been further bolstered by our acquisitions of Moda and Crossview in mid-2015 and Conexus in June 2016.\nCost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue decreased by $9.7 million, or 17.5%, to $45.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The resulting gross profit margin was $2.8 million or 5.8% of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.1 million or 5.2% of product revenue for 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses were $76.3 million, or 22.8% of total revenues in 2016 and $66.3 million, or 23.0% of total revenues in 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 includes $13.1 million of SG&A expenses for our newly consolidated acquisitions, Moda, CrossView and Conexus (including $3.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets), which were either not yet acquired as of December 31, 2015 or not included for the full year 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.2 million of SG&A expenses for Moda and CrossView (including $1.9 million of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets) and $0.4 million of expense related to the settlement of a claim relating to a discontinued business in 2015. SG&A expenses for 2016 and 2015 include approximately $3.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively of restructuring and acquisition related charges and approximately $4.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively of amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Excluding the restructuring and acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles assets in 2016 and 2015 and the claim settlement in 2015, SG&A expenses were 21.0% and 20.0% of total revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining increase in the SG&A percentage is primarily due to increases in personnel to support our professional services business activity related expenses, as well as sales and marketing activities and facility costs to support our growth, partially offset by a reduction in incentive based cash and stock compensation.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and the majority of our international operations. A valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our domestic net deferred tax assets, which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards, and for certain foreign deferred tax assets. We also recorded a deferred tax provision associated with the tax amortization of goodwill relation to our CrossView acquisition.\nSupplies Distributors and its Subsidiaries\nWe conduct a portion of our Retail business model operations through Supplies Distributors, which act as a distributor/reseller of various Ricoh and other products. We conduct these services through transaction management services agreements under which PFS provides transaction management and fulfillment services to Supplies Distributors. In addition, we have also provided Supplies Distributors with a subordinated loan that, as of December 31, 2017, had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million.\nSupplies Distributors paid us dividends of $1.7 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which eliminate in consolidation. Supplies Distributors has received lender approval to pay dividends of approximately $1.7 million in 2018, provided that no distribution may be made if, after giving effect thereto, Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries would be in noncompliance with its financial covenants under its current facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe currently believe our cash position, financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs, our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, our current debt and lease obligations, and additional loans to our subsidiaries, if necessary, for at least the next twelve months.\nTo obtain additional financing in the future, in addition to our current cash position, we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity, utilizing capital or operating leases, borrowing under our credit facilities, expanding our current credit facilities or entering into new debt agreements. No assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof.\nOur cash position decreased in 2017 primarily from using cash generated from operations to make capital expenditures, payments for acquisition-related contingencies, and to service debt obligations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2017, cash income from operations before working capital changes was $14.7 million, compared to $11.2 million in 2016 and $12.0 in 2015. In addition, we received cash flow benefits due to decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other receivables and other assets, as well as inventories, the latter decrease caused by the reduction of our Ricoh related product revenue business. The above cash proceeds were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $4.7 million, $8.7 million and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, exclusive of property and equipment acquired under debt and capital lease financing, which consisted primarily of capitalized software costs and equipment purchases.\nCapital expenditures have historically consisted of additions to upgrade our management information systems, development of customized technology solutions to support and integrate with our service fee clients and general expansion and upgrades to our facilities, both domestic and foreign. We expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities. Based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans, we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology solutions and services for the upcoming twelve months, including costs to implement new clients, will be approximately $7.0 million to $10.0 million, although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients. To maintain our current operating cash position, a portion of these expenditures may be financed through client reimbursements, debt, operating or capital leases or additional equity. We may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not obtain the financing results necessary to support such investments.\nIn 2016 and 2015, cash flows from investing activities included initial cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $8.4 million in 2016 for Conexus, and $31.6 million in 2015 for Moda and CrossView.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2017, cash used in financing activities was $14.7 million, primarily related to repayments on our debt and capital lease obligations and performance-based contingent payments, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving loan. In each of the years 2016 and 2015, cash flows from financing activities of $7.0 million and $18.6 million, respectively, were primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt, net of debt and capital lease payments and performance-based contingent payments related to our recent acquisitions.\nPayments made in relation to performance-based contingent payments were $2.0 million paid in 2017 for CrossView 2016 performance-based contingent payments, $9.5 million paid in 2016 for REV Solutions, Inc. and REVTECH Solutions India Private Limited (collectively REV\u201d), LiveAreaLabs, Inc. ( LAL\u201d) and CrossView 2015 performance-based contingent payments and $2.0 million paid in 2015 for REV and LAL 2014 performance-based contingent payments.\nWorking Capital\nDuring 2017, our working capital decreased to $13.7 million from $18.6 million at December 31, 2016, primarily driven by (i) $11.5 million net reduction of long-term debt, (ii) $3.0 million reduction of capital lease obligations, and (iii) $4.7 million used to purchase property and equipment, offset by income from operations before working capital changes.\nInventory Financing\nTo finance its distribution of Ricoh products in the U.S., Supplies Distributors has a short-term credit facility with IBM Credit LLC ( IBM Credit\u201d) that provides financing for eligible inventory and certain receivables for up to $13.0 million. We have provided a collateralized guarantee to secure the repayment of this credit facility. The IBM Credit facility does not have a stated maturity and both parties have the ability to exit the facility following a 90-day notice. The Company has direct vendor credit terms with Ricoh to finance Supplies Distributors European subsidiary's inventory purchases.\nThis credit facility contains various restrictions upon the ability of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans, investments and payments to related parties (including entities directly or indirectly owned by PFSweb, Inc.), provide guarantees, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure and pay dividends, as well as financial covenants, such as annualized revenue to working capital, net profit after tax to revenue and total liabilities to tangible net worth, as defined, and are secured by all of the assets of Supplies Distributors, as well as a collateralized guaranty of PFSweb. Additionally, we are required to maintain a subordinated loan to Supplies Distributors of no less than $2.5 million, not maintain restricted cash of more than $5.0 million, are restricted with regard to transactions with related parties, indebtedness and changes to capital stock ownership. Furthermore, we are obligated to repay any over-advance made to Supplies Distributors or its subsidiaries under these facilities if they are unable to do so. We have also provided a guarantee of substantially all of the obligations of Supplies Distributors and its subsidiaries to IBM and Ricoh.\nIn January 2018, Supplies Distributors entered into Amendment No. 19 to the IBM Credit Facility. The Amended IBM Credit Facility adjusts the minimum borrowing under the facility from $13.0 million to $11.0 million and lowers the minimum PFS Subordinated Note receivable PFSweb is required to maintain from $2.5 million to $1.0 million.\nDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\nU.S. Credit Agreement. In August 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement ( Credit Agreement\u201d) with Regions Bank, as agent for itself, Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and one or more future lenders (the Lenders\u201d). Under this Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms set forth therein, the Lenders have agreed to provide a revolving loan facility for up to $32.5 million and a term loan facility for up to $30 million. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we have the ability to increase the total loan facilities to $75 million. Availability under the revolving loan facility, which was approximately $19.3 million as of December 31, 2017, may not exceed a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable (as defined). Advances under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and have a five year maturity, with scheduled amortization payments for term loan advances. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains cross default provisions, various restrictions upon our ability to, among other things, merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make loans and payments to subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties, make capital expenditures, make investments and loans, pledge assets, make changes to capital stock ownership structure, as well as financial covenants, as defined, of a minimum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. In June 2016, PFSweb also entered into a Master Agreement with Regions Bank to provide equipment loans financing for certain capital expenditures.\nMaster Lease Agreements. The Company has various agreements that provide for leasing or financing transactions of equipment and other assets and will continue to enter into such arrangements as needed to finance the purchasing or leasing of certain equipment or other assets. Borrowings under these agreements, which generally have terms of three to five years, are generally secured by the related equipment, and in certain cases, by a Company parent guarantee.\nOther than performance-based contingent payments applicable to our CrossView acquisition, and our capital and operating lease commitments, we do not have any other material financial commitments, although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients.\nDebt Covenants / Restricted Net Assets\nCertain of our credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, and place restrictions on the transfer of assets or the payment of dividends between us and our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had restricted net assets of approximately $63.3 million and $71.6 million, respectively.\nTo the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including the financial covenant requirements and we are not able to obtain a waiver, the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of any outstanding credit facility obligations, and exercise all other rights and remedies, including sale of collateral. An acceleration of the repayment of our credit facility obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all such obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Further, non-renewal of any of our credit facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a schedule of our total contractual cash obligations, which is comprised of debt, performance-based contingent payments, operating leases and capital leases (including interest), as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\n \nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance-based\ncontingent payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, As Amended ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. The new standard, as amended, will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application with disclosure of results under the new and old standards for the first year of adoption.\nThe Company will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under the modified retrospective transition method, the Company will calculate and record the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard at January 1, 2018 for all open contracts, in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018.\nBased on its evaluation process, the Company has identified certain potential areas of impact. Application of the new standard requires that incremental costs of obtaining a contract (including sales commissions plus any associated fringe benefits) be recognized as an asset and expensed over the expected life of the arrangement. Currently the Company expenses certain contract acquisition costs as incurred. Under the new standard the Company will defer incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortize those costs over the period of benefit. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a policy election, sales commissions related to contracts less than one year to be expensed as incurred instead of capitalized, as a practical expedient. The Company has elected this practical expedient. Therefore, only commissions related to contracts greater than one year will be capitalized.\nAdditionally, the Company has reviewed the way it manages volume tiered discounts and penalties. Currently, revenue adjustments are recorded as discounts or penalties when incurred. Under ASU 2014-09, these items will be treated as variable consideration and good faith estimates will be made up front, which will have the impact of reducing some of the revenue. Variable consideration will be reassessed quarterly.\nContract modifications under prior guidance were handled as modifications, if the adjustment was for additional hours on time and materials contracts, which were adjusted and charged as work is performed monthly. Under ASU 2014-09, we will continue to account for large scope changes with significant additional distinct services with related price increases that reflect our stand-alone selling price of the scope change as separate contracts. ASU 2014-09 allows, as a transition practical expedient, for contracts modified prior to the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented under the new standard (January 1, 2018 for the Company), an entity can reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented under the new standard when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. We are electing this practical expedient.\nBased on contracts in process at December 31, 2017, the Company expects to record, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, a net cumulative adjustment to shareholders' equity not to exceed $1.0 million. The adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the modification of the amortization of implementation related deferred revenues and costs. Sales commissions were not a material amount for open contracts at December 31, 2017 and, therefore, will not have an impact at adoption.\nThe Company will make certain presentation changes on its consolidated balance sheet to comply with the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently assessing the ASU's impact on our consolidated financial statements, but do expect the adoption to have a material impact to the balance sheet through the addition of an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments - a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force\u201d ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Certain issues addressed in this guidance include - debt payments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions received from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2017-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill impairment\u201d ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2017-04.\nOn May 10, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,\u201d ( ASU 2017-09\u201d) clarifying when a change to the terms or conditions of a stock-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. ASU 2017-09 requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting condition or the classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award. ASU 2017-09 is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-09 is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as it is not the Company's practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business, operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. During the past two years, we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. In addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue primarily from services provided under contractual arrangements with our clients or from the sale of products under our distributor agreements. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, product\nshipment or delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn instances where revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal to the transaction and net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer or client and the vendor. We consider several factors to determine whether we are a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the vendor or customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks, if applicable.\nOur service fee revenue relates to our distribution services, order management/customer care services, professional, digital agency and technology services. Distribution services relate primarily to inventory management, product receiving, warehousing and fulfillment (i.e., picking, packing and shipping product on our clients' behalf). Order management/customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients' products via various channels such as telephone call-center, electronic or facsimile. These services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders, as well as cross-selling/up-selling activities. Professional and technology services relate primarily to design, implementation and support of eCommerce platforms, website solutions and quality control for our clients.\nWe typically charge our service fee revenue on either a cost-plus basis, a percent of shipped revenue basis, a time and materials, project or retainer basis for our professional services, or a per transaction basis, such as a per item basis for fulfillment services or a per labor hour basis for web-enabled customer contact center services. Additional fees are billed for other services. For technology and digital agency services, we may charge on a fixed cost basis based on an estimated maximum number of professional service labor hours.\nWe evaluate our contractual arrangements to determine whether or not they include multiple service elements. Revenue recognition is determined for the separate service elements of the contract in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.\u201d A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no return rights or other contingencies present for the delivered elements. We allocate revenue to each element based on estimated selling price. Each of our client contracts, and the related services, is unique, with individual needs and criteria customized for each client. Each client engagement is scoped and priced separately and as such we are not able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our services, nor is third-party evidence available to establish stand-alone selling prices. Accordingly we use our best estimate of selling price for the deliverables. We establish our estimates considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls as well as market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies.\nWe perform front-end set-up and integration services to support client eCommerce platforms and websites. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, we defer the start-up fees received and the related costs, and recognize them over the expected performance period. When we determine these front-end set-up and integration services do meet the criteria for recognition as a separate unit of accounting, for time and material arrangements, we recognize revenue as services are rendered and costs as they are incurred. For fixed-price arrangements, we use the completed contract method to recognize revenues and costs if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made. If reasonable and reliable costs estimates for a project can be made, we recognize revenue over the expected performance period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual effort incurred compared to the estimated total contract effort. We use this method because we consider effort incurred to date to be the best available measure of progress on contract in progress. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts, if any, are made in the period in"}
