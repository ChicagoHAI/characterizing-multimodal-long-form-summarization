MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion and analysis should be read together with our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Results for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.\nOverview\nLamb Weston, along with its joint venture partners, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We, along with our joint venture partners, are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America. We are also a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We, along with our joint venture partners, offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.\nOn November 9, 2016, we separated from Conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of our outstanding common stock to Conagra stockholders. In connection with the Separation, Conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the Lamb Weston business to us. The fiscal 2017 combined financial statements included in this Form 10-K were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Conagra's consolidated financial statements and accounting records and reflect our results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of Conagra prior to the Separation and includes allocations for a portion of Conagra's shared corporate general and administrative expenses. The fiscal 2017 financial information that includes periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone public company during all of fiscal 2017, nor are they indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition, which we refer to in this filing as MD&A,\u201d is provided as a supplement to the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and certain other financial data (Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS) that is prepared using non-GAAP financial measures. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\u201d below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income or diluted earnings per share.\nExecutive Summary\nWe delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2019, reflecting the favorable operating environment and our focus on delivering our strategic and operational objectives. Specifically, in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales increased $332.8 million, or 10%, to $3,756.5 million.

We expect to address the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity. We began operating a new processing line in Boardman, Oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as a new line in Richland, Washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, our new line in Hermiston, Oregon with a total annual production capacity of approximately 300 million pounds, became operational in May 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture, and acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 50 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. In July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. Lamb-Weston/Meijer, our joint venture in Europe, recently expanded capacity at its facility at Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, and in June 2017, acquired the potato processing business of Oerlemans Foods, which included a potato processing facility located in Broekhuizenvorst, the Netherlands. Lamb-Weston/Meijer is also party to a joint venture that constructed a new production facility in Lipetsk, a special economic zone in south Moscow, the Russian Federation, which began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nMarkets\nWe operate in the global value-added frozen potato products industry, with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in North America, and the remainder sold to customers primarily in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Oceania and the Middle East.\nIn general, demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2019. In North America, volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains ( QSRs\u201d), as well as in retail channels. Outside North America, demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both North America-based QSRs, local QSRs, and other chain and independent restaurants. In emerging markets, demand growth was also driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of Western-style food offerings and diets.\nIn this environment of growing volume demand, there was limited available capacity in North America to produce frozen potato products in fiscal 2019, which led to increased raw potato costs across the industry. In Europe, a poor potato crop resulted in higher manufacturing costs.\nOutlook\nIn fiscal 2020, we expect the overall operating environment will be generally favorable with continued solid demand growth in North America and our key international markets. New industry capacity in North America and Europe may ease near-term capacity constraints and will allow processors to operate their production facilities at more normalized levels. In addition, we expect the rate of inflation for many of our commodity and manufacturing costs will be similar to fiscal 2019. We also expect higher selling, general and administrative costs as a result of investments in our enterprise resource planning infrastructure, as well as for continued improvements in our information systems, sales, marketing, innovation, operations and other functional capabilities, designed to drive operating efficiencies and support future growth.\nResults of Operations\nWe have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. For each period presented, we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment. Net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. We define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses. Product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period.

Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase in volume and 5% increase in price/mix, primarily driven by growth in our Global segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $217.3 million, or 12%, to $1,961.5 million, compared with $1,744.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volumes, driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets, as well as the benefit of limited time product offerings. Price/mix increased 5%, largely reflecting pricing actions and favorable customer mix.\nFoodservice net sales increased $57.0 million, or 5%, to $1,156.1 million, compared with $1,099.1 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase primarily reflecting pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018, as well as improved mix. Sales volume declined nominally, as the loss of some distributor and operator-label product volumes essentially offset growth in branded products.\nRetail net sales increased $49.1 million, or 11%, to $498.3 million, compared with $449.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volume, primarily driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products. Price/mix increased 4%, largely due to improved mix and pricing actions.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $9.4 million, or 7%, to $140.6 million, compared with $131.2 million in fiscal 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher price/mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nLamb Weston's product contribution margin for fiscal 2019 increased $123.2 million, or 15%, to $971.1 million, compared with $847.9 million in fiscal 2018.\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $70.6 million, or 19%, to $446.3 million in fiscal 2019, as a result of favorable price/mix, volume and supply chain efficiency savings which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new production line in Richland, Washington. Global cost of sales was $1,508.4 million, or 11% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume, cost inflation, and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was modestly higher in 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $402.4 million in fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix and supply chain efficiency savings, which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new Richland production line. Cost of sales was $746.0 million, or 3% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely\ndue to cost inflation and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending declined approximately $1 million in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $11.5 million, or 13%, to $98.8 million in fiscal 2019 due to volume growth and favorable price/mix, more than offsetting input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Cost of sales was $381.9 million, or 10% higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume and cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018, primarily in support of Grown in Idaho and other branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $4.6 million to $23.6 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018. These amounts include a $3.3 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a $1.1 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, Other segment product contribution margin increased $9.0 million, largely due to improved price/mix in our vegetable business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $35.7 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs.\nExcluding the Separation costs, fiscal 2019 SG&A expenses increased $44.4 million, or 15%, versus the prior year. The increase in SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, was largely driven by higher expenses related to information technology services and infrastructure, as well as investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. The increase was also driven by approximately $8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange (reflecting an approximate $3 million expense in fiscal 2019 compared to an approximate $5 million benefit in fiscal 2018), an approximate $2 million increase in incentive compensation expense that primarily reflected an increase in stock price and absolute shares outstanding, and an approximate $1 million increase in advertising and promotional support, partially offset by an approximate $4 million benefit from an insurance settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $107.1 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $1.7 million compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was the result of lower average total debt versus the prior year.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was impacted by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017. Notably, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that have not been taxed previously in the U.S., limited the tax deductibility of interest, provided for immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, modified or repealed many business deductions and credits, and created new taxes on certain future foreign-sourced earnings.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense, including the impact of the comparability items recorded in fiscal 2019 and 2018, related to the Tax Act, is as follows (in millions):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes and equity method earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n561.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n471.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity method investment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n620.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n554.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n133.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparability items (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n149.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.8% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate, excluding comparability items (a) (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.9% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIn fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the one-time impacts of the Tax Act and we recorded a $2.4 million benefit for the true-up of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $59.5 million and $83.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts included a $2.6 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a nominal unrealized loss related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments declined $21.6 million, compared to fiscal 2018, largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in Europe. For more information about our joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Remaining 50.01% Interest in Lamb Weston BSW\nOn November 2, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the BSW Agreement\u201d) with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. ( Ochoa\u201d) to acquire the remaining 50.01% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, a potato processing joint venture. We paid Ochoa approximately $65 million in cash attributable to our contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW, plus $13.2 million attributable to Ochoa's interest in expected earnings of the joint venture through our fiscal year ended May 26, 2019.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, Lamb Weston BSW was considered a variable interest entity, and we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW and deducted 50.01% of the operating results of the noncontrolling interests to arrive at Net income\nattributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\u201d on our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings include 100% of Lamb Weston BSW's earnings beginning November 2, 2018, the date we entered into the BSW Agreement.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the value of Ochoa's put option. In connection with the purchase of the remaining 50.01% interest in the joint venture, we recorded $9.4 million of accretion, net of tax benefits, to increase the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the amount we agreed to pay. The purchase created $9.3 million of deferred tax assets related to the step-up in tax basis of the acquired assets. We recorded both the accretion of the noncontrolling interest and the related tax benefits in Additional distributed capital\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and they did not impact net income. While the accretion, net of tax benefits, had no impact on net income in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings, it reduced net income available to common stockholders $9.4 million, net of tax benefits, and both basic and diluted earnings per share $0.06, during fiscal 2019.\nAcquisition\nIn December 2018, we acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of the fair value at the date of acquisition, of which $75.1 million was allocated to goodwill. Operating results of the acquired company subsequent to December 21, 2018 have been included in our Global segment.\nFiscal Year Ended May 27, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2017\nNet Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions)\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct Contribution Margin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInc\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInc\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGlobal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,744.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n375.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n338.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFoodservice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,099.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,030.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n365.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n330.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRetail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n449.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n384.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n131.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,423.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,168.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n847.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n756.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nLamb Weston's net sales for fiscal 2018 increased $255.7 million, or 8%, to $3,423.7 million, compared with $3,168.0 million for fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase in price/mix and 2% increase in volume growth, with growth in each core operating segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $119.4 million, or 7%, to $1,744.2 million, compared with $1,624.8 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 5% increase in price/mix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets, as well as improved customer and product mix. Sales volumes increased 2%, primarily driven by organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains in North America. While net sales in international markets increased nominally, sales volumes declined as we chose to improve customer and product mix, as well as lower shipments to certain export markets.\nFoodservice net sales increased $69.1 million, or 7%, to $1,099.1 million, compared with $1,030.0 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase related to favorable pricing, as well as actions to improve customer and product mix. Sales volume increased 1%, which was primarily related to growth of sales of Lamb Weston-\nbranded and operator label products to small and mid-sized restaurant chains, partially offset by lower sales volume of distributor label products.\nRetail net sales increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $449.2 million, compared with $384.9 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 12% increase in sales volume, driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products, as well as increased shipments of private label products. Price/mix increased 5%, reflecting higher prices across the branded and private label portfolios, as well as improved mix, partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $2.9 million, or 2%, to $131.2 million, compared with $128.3 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to favorable product mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $37.1 million, or 11%, to $375.7 million in fiscal 2018, as a result of favorable price/mix and volume growth. Global cost of sales was $1,361.8 million, or 6% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume, input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $0.9 million higher in 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $35.2 million, or 11%, to $365.9 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix. Cost of sales was $724.7 million, or 5% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $9.7 million, or 13%, to $87.3 million in fiscal 2018 due to favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes. Cost of sales was $346.0 million, or 16% higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume and transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $6.5 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017, as we invested behind the introduction of Grown In Idaho branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $9.7 million to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of approximately $4 million related to our commodity option contracts and an expense in the prior year related to a recall of some vegetable products that were produced by a third party.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $38.9 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) and $26.5 million ($16.7 million after-tax) of expenses for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs. Fiscal 2017 also included a $3.1 million ($2.0 million after-tax) non-cash gain on assets. Excluding these items, fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses increased $53.6 million, or 23%, versus the prior year largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation costs based on operating performance, and a $9.0 million increase in advertising and promotional support. In addition, the increase in SG&A expenses also included approximately $5 million to establish a new Lamb Weston charitable foundation, and approximately $4 million of costs related to transitioning our Foodservice segment go-to-market strategy from a broker-led sales model to a direct sales model.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $108.8 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $47.6 million compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense, net was the result of recognizing interest expense for a full-year for the debt incurred in connection with the Separation, compared with recognizing approximately only seven months of interest expense on this debt during fiscal 2017.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes and equity method earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n471.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n457.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity method investment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n554.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n510.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n170.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExcluding $28.4 million of provisional impacts of the Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.0%. This rate varies from the fiscal 2018 U.S. corporate statutory tax rate of 29.3%, primarily due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, the domestic manufacturers deduction, foreign taxes, and other permanent differences.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, income tax expense decreased $64.7 million; $36.3 million of the decrease related to a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and $28.4 million related to the provisional impacts of the Tax Act that was enacted in December 2017. For further information on the Tax Act and its impact, see Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $83.6 million and $53.3 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts included a nominal unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the current year, and a $3.6 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2017. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $33.9 million, driven by solid operating results in Europe and the U.S., including lower raw potato and production costs in Europe, volume growth, a $5.4 million foreign currency translation benefit, and an approximate $4 million gain related to a divestiture of a non-core business. The increase was partially offset by lower price/mix in Europe. For more information about our joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn fiscal 2019, cash from operations increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million. In addition to using cash for normal operating requirements, we invested in our business and returned cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2019, we spent $334.2 million on capital expenditures, including the construction of a new french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon, that\nadded 300 million pounds of additional annualized production capacity. We also used cash for acquisitions. We expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired, and we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture for $78.2 million. Finally, we returned cash to shareholders, including $113.3 million in dividends and we repurchased 458,749 shares of our common stock for $31.8 million. We ended the year with $12.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $489.4 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. Currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, debt service, income tax payments, and stock repurchases.\nWe believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payment of any dividends declared on our common stock, for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities (dollars in millions):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n680.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n481.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n446.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(423.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(306.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(285.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(299.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(178.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(142.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(41.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(43.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million in fiscal 2019, compared with $481.2 million in fiscal 2018. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $161.5 million primarily due to favorable price/mix and sales volumes, and a decrease in cash taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $38.2 million more cash in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by the timing of payments for accounts payable, timing of receipt of cash for accounts receivable, a smaller year-over-year increase in prepaid expenses and current assets, and inventories. These changes were offset partially by the timing of payments for income taxes and accrued expenses.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $34.3 million to $481.2 million in fiscal 2018, compared with $446.9 million in fiscal 2017. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $91.4 million primarily due to favorable price/mix, and volume. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $57.1 million more cash in fiscal 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 due to increased sales and timing of collections, the timing of payments for\naccrued expenses relating to employee compensation and accrued interest in fiscal 2018, and the timing of payments for accounts payable. These cash outflows were offset partially by lower payments for income taxes, primarily related to the Tax Act.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nInvesting activities used $423.0 million of cash in fiscal 2019, compared with $306.8 million in fiscal 2018. These expenditures include the plant capacity expansions in Hermiston, Oregon in fiscal 2019 and Richland, Washington in fiscal 2018. Additionally, in December 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired.\nWe expect capital investments in fiscal 2020 to be approximately $275 million, which excludes acquisitions. These expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. At May 26, 2019, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $41.5 million.\nIn July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, for approximately $117 million, plus or minus final working capital adjustments. This added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nInvesting activities used $306.8 million of cash in fiscal 2018, compared with $285.3 million in fiscal 2017. These expenditures include plant capacity expansions at our Richland, Washington facility in fiscal 2018 and Boardman, Oregon facility in fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash used for financing activities totaled $299.6 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $178.9 million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $113.3 million in dividends on our common stock, $78.2 million to acquire the noncontrolling interest in Lamb Weston BSW, $66.7 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility and the repayment of the Lamb Weston BSW installment notes, and $6.1 million of distributions paid to noncontrolling interest. Financing activities during 2019 also included the repurchase of 522,260 shares of our common stock, including restricted stock tax withholdings. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $36.4 million, including $31.8 million related to shares repurchased at an average price of $69.40 per share under our share repurchase program. In December 2018, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock. We will continue to repurchase shares, on an opportunistic basis, in open market repurchase transactions. As of July 15, 2019, $218.2 million remained authorized for purchase under the program.\nDuring fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings.\nOn June 28, 2019, we amended our credit agreement to refinance $300.0 million of the $599.1 million term loan facility outstanding at May 26, 2019 ( New Term Loan Agreement\u201d), for a lower overall interest rate, including anticipated patronage dividends. The New Term Loan Agreement bears interest, before anticipated patronage dividends, at LIBOR or\nthe Base Rate (each as defined in the New Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.625% to 2.375% for LIBOR-based loans and from 0.625% to 1.375% for Base Rate-based loans, depending upon our total net leverage ratio. The borrowings under the New Term Loan Agreement mature June 28, 2024, and the covenants, events of default, and guarantees are consistent with the Credit Facilities discussed in Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. The amended credit agreement also provides for the ability, under certain circumstances, to add incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million. Our total term loan indebtedness remains the same before and after the refinancing.\nFor more information about our debt, including among other items, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. At May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our credit agreement.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used for financing activities totaled $178.9 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $142.0 million in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings. We had no net transfers to Conagra in fiscal 2018, compared with $38.8 million of net transfers in fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash used for financing activities primarily related to the Separation. In fiscal 2017, we issued $2,341.0 million of debt in connection with the Separation, of which $1,542.9 million of proceeds were distributed directly to Conagra (including $25.4 million that Conagra used to pay debt issuance costs) and are considered a noncash financing activity for Lamb Weston. We received $798.1 million of cash proceeds from the debt issuance. We used the $798.1 million of proceeds, together with borrowings on our revolving credit facility, to fund an $823.5 million cash payment to Conagra on the Separation Date. We paid $27.4 million of dividends to common stockholders, $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, and $2.8 million of net short-term borrowings. We made cash distributions to noncontrolling interest of $12.2 million and $23.8 million of debt repayments in fiscal 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 26, 2019 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nLamb Weston has interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities. For more information about our investments in joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, potato supply agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum\nprices).

The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance and underlying prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way. These measures are not a substitute for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income (loss) or diluted earnings per share, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our trade promotions, income taxes, and acquisitions, among others. We base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results. These estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.\nSales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances\nWe promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Sales promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, and volume-based incentives. The estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and coupon utilization and redemption rates, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories.\nTrade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. The cost of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates made at the time of shipment or coupon release. The estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators. Estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs, with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following: quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities, current and past trade-promotion spending patterns, the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category, and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs.\nThe determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation, particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products. Final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event. Because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates. As additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. At May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, we had $48.6 million and $45.4 million, respectively, of sales incentives and trade promotions payable recorded in Accrued liabilities\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled.\nInherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Management judgments are required for the following items:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nManagement reviews deferred tax assets for realizability. Valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe establish accruals for unrecognized tax benefits when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believe that an uncertain tax position does not meet the recognition threshold of ASC 740, Income Taxes. These contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return, case law and emerging legislation. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular matter, we believe that the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019, reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies as of such date in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes under ASC 740.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have not recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we believe the judgements and estimates discussed above and made by management are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nFrom time to time, we may enter into business combinations. We allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values (fair value is determined using the income approach, cost approach and or market approach) of inventory, property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, among others. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we expense any acquisition-related costs as incurred in connection with each business combination.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of brands and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to\ndevelop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could increase or decrease.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFor a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion and analysis should be read together with our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Results for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.\nOverview\nLamb Weston, along with its joint venture partners, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We, along with our joint venture partners, are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America. We are also a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We, along with our joint venture partners, offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.\nOn November 9, 2016, we separated from Conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of our outstanding common stock to Conagra stockholders. In connection with the Separation, Conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the Lamb Weston business to us. The fiscal 2017 combined financial statements included in this Form 10-K were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Conagra's consolidated financial statements and accounting records and reflect our results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of Conagra prior to the Separation and includes allocations for a portion of Conagra's shared corporate general and administrative expenses. The fiscal 2017 financial information that includes periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone public company during all of fiscal 2017, nor are they indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition, which we refer to in this filing as MD&A,\u201d is provided as a supplement to the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and certain other financial data (Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS) that is prepared using non-GAAP financial measures. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\u201d below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income or diluted earnings per share.\nExecutive Summary\nWe delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2019, reflecting the favorable operating environment and our focus on delivering our strategic and operational objectives. Specifically, in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018:\n \u00b7 Net sales increased $332.8 million, or 10%, to $3,756.5 million. Volume increased 5%, primarily driven by growth in our Global segment. Price/mix increased 5% due to pricing actions and favorable product and customer mix. \n \u00b7 Net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased $61.8 million, or 15%, to $478.6 million. The increase largely reflects growth in income from operations, a lower tax rate attributable to the Tax Act, and an \n approximate $6 million incremental benefit from acquiring the remaining 50.01% equity interest in our joint venture, Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (the BSW Acquisition\u201d), partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Excluding a $2.4 million decrease in income tax expense related to the true-up of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings under the Tax Act in fiscal 2019, $28.4 million of income tax benefits from the Tax Act, and $8.7 million ($5.7 million after taxes) of costs related to the Separation in fiscal year 2018, net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased $82.1 million to $476.2 million. The increase primarily reflects growth in income from operations, a $24.8 million benefit from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, and an approximate $6 million incremental benefit from the BSW Acquisition, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per share increased $0.36, or 13%, to $3.18. The increase largely reflects growth in income from operations, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings and an approximate $0.02 net decrease related to the BSW Acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included a $0.17 incremental tax benefit related to a lower tax rate that was offset by a $0.17 decrease in tax benefit comparability items related to the Tax Act. \n \u00b7 Adjusted Diluted EPS increased $0.56, or 21%, to $3.22. The increase was driven by growth in income from operations, a $0.17 incremental benefit related to a lower tax rate, and an approximate $0.05 benefit from the BSW Acquisition, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased $83.9 million, or 10%, to $904.3 million, reflecting growth in income from operations, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Gross profit increased $124.0 million, or 14%, to $1,003.5 million, due to favorable price/mix, volume and supply chain efficiency savings. The increase was partially offset by transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with our french fry production line in Richland, Washington, that became operational in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit included a $10.8 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in the current year, compared with a nominal gain related to these items in the prior year. \n \u00b7 Equity method investment earnings decreased $24.1 million to $59.5 million, and included a $2.6 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019 and a nominal unrealized loss related to these items in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments declined $21.6 million compared to fiscal 2018, largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in Europe. \n \u00b7 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 increased $199.7 million, or 42%, to $680.9 million, primarily driven by earnings growth. During fiscal 2019, we added $334.2 million of capital assets, paid $166.8 million for the acquisition of a business and the remaining interest in Lamb Weston BSW, and returned $145.1 million of cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. \n \u00b7 The Global segment's net sales increased $217.3 million, or 12%, to $1,961.5 million, with volume up 7% and price/mix up 5%, compared with fiscal 2018. Global segment product contribution margin increased $70.6 million, or 19%, to $446.3 million. \n \u00b7 The Foodservice segment's net sales increased $57.0 million, or 5%, to $1,156.1 million, with price/mix up 5% and volume declining nominally. Foodservice segment product contribution margin increased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $402.4 million. \n \u00b7 The Retail segment's net sales increased $49.1 million, or 11%, to $498.3 million, with volume up 7% and price/mix up 4%. Retail segment product contribution margin increased $11.5 million, or 13%, to $98.8 million. \n \u00b7 The Other segment's net sales increased $9.4 million, or 7%, to $140.6 million, with price/mix up 5% and volume up 2%. Other segment product contribution margin increased $4.6 million, or 24%, to $23.6 million. \nDemand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world. We expect to address the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity. We began operating a new processing line in Boardman, Oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as a new line in Richland, Washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, our new line in Hermiston, Oregon with a total annual production capacity of approximately 300 million pounds, became operational in May 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture, and acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 50 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. In July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. Lamb-Weston/Meijer, our joint venture in Europe, recently expanded capacity at its facility at Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, and in June 2017, acquired the potato processing business of Oerlemans Foods, which included a potato processing facility located in Broekhuizenvorst, the Netherlands. Lamb-Weston/Meijer is also party to a joint venture that constructed a new production facility in Lipetsk, a special economic zone in south Moscow, the Russian Federation, which began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nMarkets\nWe operate in the global value-added frozen potato products industry, with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in North America, and the remainder sold to customers primarily in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Oceania and the Middle East.\nIn general, demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2019. In North America, volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains ( QSRs\u201d), as well as in retail channels. Outside North America, demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both North America-based QSRs, local QSRs, and other chain and independent restaurants. In emerging markets, demand growth was also driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of Western-style food offerings and diets.\nIn this environment of growing volume demand, there was limited available capacity in North America to produce frozen potato products in fiscal 2019, which led to increased raw potato costs across the industry. In Europe, a poor potato crop resulted in higher manufacturing costs.\nOutlook\nIn fiscal 2020, we expect the overall operating environment will be generally favorable with continued solid demand growth in North America and our key international markets. New industry capacity in North America and Europe may ease near-term capacity constraints and will allow processors to operate their production facilities at more normalized levels. In addition, we expect the rate of inflation for many of our commodity and manufacturing costs will be similar to fiscal 2019. We also expect higher selling, general and administrative costs as a result of investments in our enterprise resource planning infrastructure, as well as for continued improvements in our information systems, sales, marketing, innovation, operations and other functional capabilities, designed to drive operating efficiencies and support future growth.\nResults of Operations\nWe have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. For each period presented, we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment. Net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. We define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses. Product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period. For additional information on our reportable segments, see Note 15, Segments, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nFiscal Year Ended May 26, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 27, 2018\nNet Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions)\n\nNet Sales\nLamb Weston's net sales for fiscal 2019 increased $332.8 million, or 10%, to $3,756.5 million, compared with $3,423.7 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase in volume and 5% increase in price/mix, primarily driven by growth in our Global segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $217.3 million, or 12%, to $1,961.5 million, compared with $1,744.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volumes, driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets, as well as the benefit of limited time product offerings. Price/mix increased 5%, largely reflecting pricing actions and favorable customer mix.\nFoodservice net sales increased $57.0 million, or 5%, to $1,156.1 million, compared with $1,099.1 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase primarily reflecting pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018, as well as improved mix. Sales volume declined nominally, as the loss of some distributor and operator-label product volumes essentially offset growth in branded products.\nRetail net sales increased $49.1 million, or 11%, to $498.3 million, compared with $449.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volume, primarily driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products. Price/mix increased 4%, largely due to improved mix and pricing actions.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $9.4 million, or 7%, to $140.6 million, compared with $131.2 million in fiscal 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher price/mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nLamb Weston's product contribution margin for fiscal 2019 increased $123.2 million, or 15%, to $971.1 million, compared with $847.9 million in fiscal 2018.\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $70.6 million, or 19%, to $446.3 million in fiscal 2019, as a result of favorable price/mix, volume and supply chain efficiency savings which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new production line in Richland, Washington. Global cost of sales was $1,508.4 million, or 11% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume, cost inflation, and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was modestly higher in 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $402.4 million in fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix and supply chain efficiency savings, which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new Richland production line. Cost of sales was $746.0 million, or 3% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely\ndue to cost inflation and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending declined approximately $1 million in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $11.5 million, or 13%, to $98.8 million in fiscal 2019 due to volume growth and favorable price/mix, more than offsetting input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Cost of sales was $381.9 million, or 10% higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume and cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018, primarily in support of Grown in Idaho and other branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $4.6 million to $23.6 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018. These amounts include a $3.3 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a $1.1 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, Other segment product contribution margin increased $9.0 million, largely due to improved price/mix in our vegetable business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $35.7 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs.\nExcluding the Separation costs, fiscal 2019 SG&A expenses increased $44.4 million, or 15%, versus the prior year. The increase in SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, was largely driven by higher expenses related to information technology services and infrastructure, as well as investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. The increase was also driven by approximately $8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange (reflecting an approximate $3 million expense in fiscal 2019 compared to an approximate $5 million benefit in fiscal 2018), an approximate $2 million increase in incentive compensation expense that primarily reflected an increase in stock price and absolute shares outstanding, and an approximate $1 million increase in advertising and promotional support, partially offset by an approximate $4 million benefit from an insurance settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $107.1 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $1.7 million compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was the result of lower average total debt versus the prior year.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was impacted by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017. Notably, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that have not been taxed previously in the U.S., limited the tax deductibility of interest, provided for immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, modified or repealed many business deductions and credits, and created new taxes on certain future foreign-sourced earnings.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense, including the impact of the comparability items recorded in fiscal 2019 and 2018, related to the Tax Act, is as follows (in millions):\n\n (a) In fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the one-time impacts of the Tax Act and we recorded a $2.4 million benefit for the true-up of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings. In connection with our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, we decreased income tax expense and increased net income $28.4 million, including a $39.9 million net provisional tax benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities with the new lower federal tax rate, partially offset by an $11.5 million transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings. \n (b) Since our fiscal year end is the last Sunday of May, in fiscal 2018, we phased in the impact of the lower tax rate, which after excluding comparability items, resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.0%. In fiscal 2019, the rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the impact of U.S. state and foreign taxes. \nFor further information on the Tax Act and its impact, see Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $59.5 million and $83.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts included a $2.6 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a nominal unrealized loss related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments declined $21.6 million, compared to fiscal 2018, largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in Europe. For more information about our joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Remaining 50.01% Interest in Lamb Weston BSW\nOn November 2, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the BSW Agreement\u201d) with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. ( Ochoa\u201d) to acquire the remaining 50.01% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, a potato processing joint venture. We paid Ochoa approximately $65 million in cash attributable to our contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW, plus $13.2 million attributable to Ochoa's interest in expected earnings of the joint venture through our fiscal year ended May 26, 2019.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, Lamb Weston BSW was considered a variable interest entity, and we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW and deducted 50.01% of the operating results of the noncontrolling interests to arrive at Net income\nattributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\u201d on our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings include 100% of Lamb Weston BSW's earnings beginning November 2, 2018, the date we entered into the BSW Agreement.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the value of Ochoa's put option. In connection with the purchase of the remaining 50.01% interest in the joint venture, we recorded $9.4 million of accretion, net of tax benefits, to increase the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the amount we agreed to pay. The purchase created $9.3 million of deferred tax assets related to the step-up in tax basis of the acquired assets. We recorded both the accretion of the noncontrolling interest and the related tax benefits in Additional distributed capital\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and they did not impact net income. While the accretion, net of tax benefits, had no impact on net income in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings, it reduced net income available to common stockholders $9.4 million, net of tax benefits, and both basic and diluted earnings per share $0.06, during fiscal 2019.\nAcquisition\nIn December 2018, we acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of the fair value at the date of acquisition, of which $75.1 million was allocated to goodwill. Operating results of the acquired company subsequent to December 21, 2018 have been included in our Global segment.\nFiscal Year Ended May 27, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2017\nNet Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions)\n\nNet Sales\nLamb Weston's net sales for fiscal 2018 increased $255.7 million, or 8%, to $3,423.7 million, compared with $3,168.0 million for fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase in price/mix and 2% increase in volume growth, with growth in each core operating segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $119.4 million, or 7%, to $1,744.2 million, compared with $1,624.8 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 5% increase in price/mix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets, as well as improved customer and product mix. Sales volumes increased 2%, primarily driven by organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains in North America. While net sales in international markets increased nominally, sales volumes declined as we chose to improve customer and product mix, as well as lower shipments to certain export markets.\nFoodservice net sales increased $69.1 million, or 7%, to $1,099.1 million, compared with $1,030.0 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase related to favorable pricing, as well as actions to improve customer and product mix. Sales volume increased 1%, which was primarily related to growth of sales of Lamb Weston-\nbranded and operator label products to small and mid-sized restaurant chains, partially offset by lower sales volume of distributor label products.\nRetail net sales increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $449.2 million, compared with $384.9 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 12% increase in sales volume, driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products, as well as increased shipments of private label products. Price/mix increased 5%, reflecting higher prices across the branded and private label portfolios, as well as improved mix, partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $2.9 million, or 2%, to $131.2 million, compared with $128.3 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to favorable product mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $37.1 million, or 11%, to $375.7 million in fiscal 2018, as a result of favorable price/mix and volume growth. Global cost of sales was $1,361.8 million, or 6% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume, input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $0.9 million higher in 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $35.2 million, or 11%, to $365.9 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix. Cost of sales was $724.7 million, or 5% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $9.7 million, or 13%, to $87.3 million in fiscal 2018 due to favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes. Cost of sales was $346.0 million, or 16% higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume and transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $6.5 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017, as we invested behind the introduction of Grown In Idaho branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $9.7 million to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of approximately $4 million related to our commodity option contracts and an expense in the prior year related to a recall of some vegetable products that were produced by a third party.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $38.9 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) and $26.5 million ($16.7 million after-tax) of expenses for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs. Fiscal 2017 also included a $3.1 million ($2.0 million after-tax) non-cash gain on assets. Excluding these items, fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses increased $53.6 million, or 23%, versus the prior year largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation costs based on operating performance, and a $9.0 million increase in advertising and promotional support. In addition, the increase in SG&A expenses also included approximately $5 million to establish a new Lamb Weston charitable foundation, and approximately $4 million of costs related to transitioning our Foodservice segment go-to-market strategy from a broker-led sales model to a direct sales model.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $108.8 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $47.6 million compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense, net was the result of recognizing interest expense for a full-year for the debt incurred in connection with the Separation, compared with recognizing approximately only seven months of interest expense on this debt during fiscal 2017.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\n\n (a) Excluding $28.4 million of provisional impacts of the Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.0%. This rate varies from the fiscal 2018 U.S. corporate statutory tax rate of 29.3%, primarily due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, the domestic manufacturers deduction, foreign taxes, and other permanent differences. \nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, income tax expense decreased $64.7 million; $36.3 million of the decrease related to a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and $28.4 million related to the provisional impacts of the Tax Act that was enacted in December 2017. For further information on the Tax Act and its impact, see Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $83.6 million and $53.3 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts included a nominal unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the current year, and a $3.6 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2017. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $33.9 million, driven by solid operating results in Europe and the U.S., including lower raw potato and production costs in Europe, volume growth, a $5.4 million foreign currency translation benefit, and an approximate $4 million gain related to a divestiture of a non-core business. The increase was partially offset by lower price/mix in Europe. For more information about our joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn fiscal 2019, cash from operations increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million. In addition to using cash for normal operating requirements, we invested in our business and returned cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2019, we spent $334.2 million on capital expenditures, including the construction of a new french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon, that\nadded 300 million pounds of additional annualized production capacity. We also used cash for acquisitions. We expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired, and we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture for $78.2 million. Finally, we returned cash to shareholders, including $113.3 million in dividends and we repurchased 458,749 shares of our common stock for $31.8 million. We ended the year with $12.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $489.4 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. Currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, debt service, income tax payments, and stock repurchases.\nWe believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payment of any dividends declared on our common stock, for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities (dollars in millions):\n\nOperating Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million in fiscal 2019, compared with $481.2 million in fiscal 2018. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $161.5 million primarily due to favorable price/mix and sales volumes, and a decrease in cash taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $38.2 million more cash in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by the timing of payments for accounts payable, timing of receipt of cash for accounts receivable, a smaller year-over-year increase in prepaid expenses and current assets, and inventories. These changes were offset partially by the timing of payments for income taxes and accrued expenses.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $34.3 million to $481.2 million in fiscal 2018, compared with $446.9 million in fiscal 2017. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $91.4 million primarily due to favorable price/mix, and volume. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $57.1 million more cash in fiscal 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 due to increased sales and timing of collections, the timing of payments for\naccrued expenses relating to employee compensation and accrued interest in fiscal 2018, and the timing of payments for accounts payable. These cash outflows were offset partially by lower payments for income taxes, primarily related to the Tax Act.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nInvesting activities used $423.0 million of cash in fiscal 2019, compared with $306.8 million in fiscal 2018. These expenditures include the plant capacity expansions in Hermiston, Oregon in fiscal 2019 and Richland, Washington in fiscal 2018. Additionally, in December 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired.\nWe expect capital investments in fiscal 2020 to be approximately $275 million, which excludes acquisitions. These expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. At May 26, 2019, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $41.5 million.\nIn July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, for approximately $117 million, plus or minus final working capital adjustments. This added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nInvesting activities used $306.8 million of cash in fiscal 2018, compared with $285.3 million in fiscal 2017. These expenditures include plant capacity expansions at our Richland, Washington facility in fiscal 2018 and Boardman, Oregon facility in fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash used for financing activities totaled $299.6 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $178.9 million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $113.3 million in dividends on our common stock, $78.2 million to acquire the noncontrolling interest in Lamb Weston BSW, $66.7 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility and the repayment of the Lamb Weston BSW installment notes, and $6.1 million of distributions paid to noncontrolling interest. Financing activities during 2019 also included the repurchase of 522,260 shares of our common stock, including restricted stock tax withholdings. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $36.4 million, including $31.8 million related to shares repurchased at an average price of $69.40 per share under our share repurchase program. In December 2018, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock. We will continue to repurchase shares, on an opportunistic basis, in open market repurchase transactions. As of July 15, 2019, $218.2 million remained authorized for purchase under the program.\nDuring fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings.\nOn June 28, 2019, we amended our credit agreement to refinance $300.0 million of the $599.1 million term loan facility outstanding at May 26, 2019 ( New Term Loan Agreement\u201d), for a lower overall interest rate, including anticipated patronage dividends. The New Term Loan Agreement bears interest, before anticipated patronage dividends, at LIBOR or\nthe Base Rate (each as defined in the New Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.625% to 2.375% for LIBOR-based loans and from 0.625% to 1.375% for Base Rate-based loans, depending upon our total net leverage ratio. The borrowings under the New Term Loan Agreement mature June 28, 2024, and the covenants, events of default, and guarantees are consistent with the Credit Facilities discussed in Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. The amended credit agreement also provides for the ability, under certain circumstances, to add incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million. Our total term loan indebtedness remains the same before and after the refinancing.\nFor more information about our debt, including among other items, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. At May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our credit agreement.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used for financing activities totaled $178.9 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $142.0 million in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings. We had no net transfers to Conagra in fiscal 2018, compared with $38.8 million of net transfers in fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash used for financing activities primarily related to the Separation. In fiscal 2017, we issued $2,341.0 million of debt in connection with the Separation, of which $1,542.9 million of proceeds were distributed directly to Conagra (including $25.4 million that Conagra used to pay debt issuance costs) and are considered a noncash financing activity for Lamb Weston. We received $798.1 million of cash proceeds from the debt issuance. We used the $798.1 million of proceeds, together with borrowings on our revolving credit facility, to fund an $823.5 million cash payment to Conagra on the Separation Date. We paid $27.4 million of dividends to common stockholders, $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, and $2.8 million of net short-term borrowings. We made cash distributions to noncontrolling interest of $12.2 million and $23.8 million of debt repayments in fiscal 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 26, 2019 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nLamb Weston has interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities. For more information about our investments in joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, potato supply agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum\nprices). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available.\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, are as follows. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table are estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n (a) The table assumes amounts included in the Less than 1 Year\u201d column represent obligations for our fiscal year 2020. The remaining columns correspond to our fiscal years as follows: 1-3 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2021 and 2022, 3-5 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2023 and 2024, and After 5 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2025 and thereafter. \n (b) The table is based on our long-term debt maturities at May 26, 2019, and includes the current portion of long-term debt. Amounts are reported gross. Balances have not been reduced by the $25.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs at May 26, 2019. \n (c) Amounts represent estimated future interest payments as of May 26, 2019, assuming our long-term debt and financing obligations are held to maturity and using interest rates in effect at May 26, 2019. \n (d) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. We lease some of our warehouses and operating facilities, as well as other property and equipment, under operating leases. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and/or if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. \n (e) The table is based on our financing obligation maturities at May 26, 2019, assumes our financing obligations are held to maturity, includes the current portion of financing obligations, and excludes interest payments associated with financing obligations. Amounts are reported gross. \n (f) Amount excludes purchase commitments under potato supply agreements due to uncertainty of pricing and quantity. Potato supply agreements have maximum contracted pricing with deductions for certain quality attributes, and quantities purchased are determined by the yields produced on contracted acres. Total purchases under all our potato supply agreements were $592.3 million, $595.8 million, and $596.1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \n (g) Capital commitments represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 26, 2019, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property. \n (h) Deferred income taxes of $125.7 million are excluded from this table, because the timing of their future cash outflows are uncertain. \n (i) Amounts consist of our pension, post-retirement obligations, cash-settled restricted stock unit obligations, and deferred compensation liabilities. Actuarially determined liabilities related to pension benefits are recorded based on estimates and assumptions. Key factors used in developing estimates of these liabilities include assumptions related to discount rates, expected rate of compensation increases, retirement and mortality rates, and other factors. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the measurement of funded status will impact the amounts reported. In the table above, we allocated our pension obligations by year based on the future required minimum pension contributions, as determined by our actuaries. See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits, and Note 11, Stock-based Compensation, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. \n (j) Long-term workers compensation of $8.5 million and uncertain tax positions of $22.3 million are excluded from this table because the timing of their future cash outflows are uncertain. Amount also excludes $12.0 million of a deferred gain as the amount is non-cash. \n (k) At the beginning of fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), and in June 2019, we amended our credit agreement and entered into a New Term Loan Agreement. In connection with these events, our total contractual obligations increased (decreased) as follows: \n\n (1) See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. \n (2) See Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. \nFor the majority of restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\nTo supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\nLamb Weston's management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS to evaluate the Company's performance excluding the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods. The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance and underlying prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way. These measures are not a substitute for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income (loss) or diluted earnings per share, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\n (a) Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 include $8.7 million, $26.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of expenses related to the Separation. In fiscal 2018, the expenses related primarily to professional fees and other employee-related costs. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, the expenses related primarily to professional fees. \nFiscal 2017 includes a $3.1 million non-cash gain on assets.\nFiscal 2016 includes $59.5 million of charges reflecting Lamb Weston's portion of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of Conagra's pension liability for Conagra sponsored plans.\nFiscal 2016 and 2015 include $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to costs incurred in connection with Conagra's initiative to improve selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies, which is referred to as the Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan ( SCAE Plan\u201d).\n (b) Adjusted EBITDA includes EBITDA from consolidated joint ventures. \n (c) Fiscal 2016 includes a $17.7 million non-cash gain related to the settlement of a pension plan at our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture. \nThe following table reconciles diluted earnings per share to Adjusted Diluted EPS:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion and analysis should be read together with our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Results for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.\nOverview\nLamb Weston, along with its joint venture partners, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We, along with our joint venture partners, are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America. We are also a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We, along with our joint venture partners, offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.\nOn November 9, 2016, we separated from Conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of our outstanding common stock to Conagra stockholders. In connection with the Separation, Conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the Lamb Weston business to us. The fiscal 2017 combined financial statements included in this Form 10-K were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Conagra's consolidated financial statements and accounting records and reflect our results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of Conagra prior to the Separation and includes allocations for a portion of Conagra's shared corporate general and administrative expenses. The fiscal 2017 financial information that includes periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone public company during all of fiscal 2017, nor are they indicative of what our results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition, which we refer to in this filing as MD&A,\u201d is provided as a supplement to the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and certain other financial data (Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS) that is prepared using non-GAAP financial measures. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\u201d below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income or diluted earnings per share.\nExecutive Summary\nWe delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2019, reflecting the favorable operating environment and our focus on delivering our strategic and operational objectives. Specifically, in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018:\n \u00b7 Net sales increased $332.8 million, or 10%, to $3,756.5 million. Volume increased 5%, primarily driven by growth in our Global segment. Price/mix increased 5% due to pricing actions and favorable product and customer mix. \n \u00b7 Net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased $61.8 million, or 15%, to $478.6 million. The increase largely reflects growth in income from operations, a lower tax rate attributable to the Tax Act, and an \n approximate $6 million incremental benefit from acquiring the remaining 50.01% equity interest in our joint venture, Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (the BSW Acquisition\u201d), partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Excluding a $2.4 million decrease in income tax expense related to the true-up of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings under the Tax Act in fiscal 2019, $28.4 million of income tax benefits from the Tax Act, and $8.7 million ($5.7 million after taxes) of costs related to the Separation in fiscal year 2018, net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased $82.1 million to $476.2 million. The increase primarily reflects growth in income from operations, a $24.8 million benefit from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, and an approximate $6 million incremental benefit from the BSW Acquisition, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per share increased $0.36, or 13%, to $3.18. The increase largely reflects growth in income from operations, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings and an approximate $0.02 net decrease related to the BSW Acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included a $0.17 incremental tax benefit related to a lower tax rate that was offset by a $0.17 decrease in tax benefit comparability items related to the Tax Act. \n \u00b7 Adjusted Diluted EPS increased $0.56, or 21%, to $3.22. The increase was driven by growth in income from operations, a $0.17 incremental benefit related to a lower tax rate, and an approximate $0.05 benefit from the BSW Acquisition, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased $83.9 million, or 10%, to $904.3 million, reflecting growth in income from operations, partially offset by lower equity method investment earnings. \n \u00b7 Gross profit increased $124.0 million, or 14%, to $1,003.5 million, due to favorable price/mix, volume and supply chain efficiency savings. The increase was partially offset by transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with our french fry production line in Richland, Washington, that became operational in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit included a $10.8 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in the current year, compared with a nominal gain related to these items in the prior year. \n \u00b7 Equity method investment earnings decreased $24.1 million to $59.5 million, and included a $2.6 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019 and a nominal unrealized loss related to these items in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments declined $21.6 million compared to fiscal 2018, largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in Europe. \n \u00b7 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 increased $199.7 million, or 42%, to $680.9 million, primarily driven by earnings growth. During fiscal 2019, we added $334.2 million of capital assets, paid $166.8 million for the acquisition of a business and the remaining interest in Lamb Weston BSW, and returned $145.1 million of cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. \n \u00b7 The Global segment's net sales increased $217.3 million, or 12%, to $1,961.5 million, with volume up 7% and price/mix up 5%, compared with fiscal 2018. Global segment product contribution margin increased $70.6 million, or 19%, to $446.3 million. \n \u00b7 The Foodservice segment's net sales increased $57.0 million, or 5%, to $1,156.1 million, with price/mix up 5% and volume declining nominally. Foodservice segment product contribution margin increased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $402.4 million. \n \u00b7 The Retail segment's net sales increased $49.1 million, or 11%, to $498.3 million, with volume up 7% and price/mix up 4%. Retail segment product contribution margin increased $11.5 million, or 13%, to $98.8 million. \n \u00b7 The Other segment's net sales increased $9.4 million, or 7%, to $140.6 million, with price/mix up 5% and volume up 2%. Other segment product contribution margin increased $4.6 million, or 24%, to $23.6 million. \nDemand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world. We expect to address the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity. We began operating a new processing line in Boardman, Oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as a new line in Richland, Washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, our new line in Hermiston, Oregon with a total annual production capacity of approximately 300 million pounds, became operational in May 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture, and acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 50 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. In July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, which added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network. Lamb-Weston/Meijer, our joint venture in Europe, recently expanded capacity at its facility at Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, and in June 2017, acquired the potato processing business of Oerlemans Foods, which included a potato processing facility located in Broekhuizenvorst, the Netherlands. Lamb-Weston/Meijer is also party to a joint venture that constructed a new production facility in Lipetsk, a special economic zone in south Moscow, the Russian Federation, which began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nMarkets\nWe operate in the global value-added frozen potato products industry, with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in North America, and the remainder sold to customers primarily in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Oceania and the Middle East.\nIn general, demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2019. In North America, volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains ( QSRs\u201d), as well as in retail channels. Outside North America, demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both North America-based QSRs, local QSRs, and other chain and independent restaurants. In emerging markets, demand growth was also driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of Western-style food offerings and diets.\nIn this environment of growing volume demand, there was limited available capacity in North America to produce frozen potato products in fiscal 2019, which led to increased raw potato costs across the industry. In Europe, a poor potato crop resulted in higher manufacturing costs.\nOutlook\nIn fiscal 2020, we expect the overall operating environment will be generally favorable with continued solid demand growth in North America and our key international markets. New industry capacity in North America and Europe may ease near-term capacity constraints and will allow processors to operate their production facilities at more normalized levels. In addition, we expect the rate of inflation for many of our commodity and manufacturing costs will be similar to fiscal 2019. We also expect higher selling, general and administrative costs as a result of investments in our enterprise resource planning infrastructure, as well as for continued improvements in our information systems, sales, marketing, innovation, operations and other functional capabilities, designed to drive operating efficiencies and support future growth.\nResults of Operations\nWe have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. For each period presented, we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment. Net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. We define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses. Product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period.

Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase in volume and 5% increase in price/mix, primarily driven by growth in our Global segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $217.3 million, or 12%, to $1,961.5 million, compared with $1,744.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volumes, driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets, as well as the benefit of limited time product offerings. Price/mix increased 5%, largely reflecting pricing actions and favorable customer mix.\nFoodservice net sales increased $57.0 million, or 5%, to $1,156.1 million, compared with $1,099.1 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5% increase primarily reflecting pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018, as well as improved mix. Sales volume declined nominally, as the loss of some distributor and operator-label product volumes essentially offset growth in branded products.\nRetail net sales increased $49.1 million, or 11%, to $498.3 million, compared with $449.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7% increase in sales volume, primarily driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products. Price/mix increased 4%, largely due to improved mix and pricing actions.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $9.4 million, or 7%, to $140.6 million, compared with $131.2 million in fiscal 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher price/mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nLamb Weston's product contribution margin for fiscal 2019 increased $123.2 million, or 15%, to $971.1 million, compared with $847.9 million in fiscal 2018.\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $70.6 million, or 19%, to $446.3 million in fiscal 2019, as a result of favorable price/mix, volume and supply chain efficiency savings which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new production line in Richland, Washington. Global cost of sales was $1,508.4 million, or 11% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume, cost inflation, and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was modestly higher in 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $402.4 million in fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix and supply chain efficiency savings, which more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new Richland production line. Cost of sales was $746.0 million, or 3% higher in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, largely\ndue to cost inflation and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending declined approximately $1 million in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $11.5 million, or 13%, to $98.8 million in fiscal 2019 due to volume growth and favorable price/mix, more than offsetting input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Cost of sales was $381.9 million, or 10% higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, largely due to higher sales volume and cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018, primarily in support of Grown in Idaho and other branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $4.6 million to $23.6 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018. These amounts include a $3.3 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a $1.1 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, Other segment product contribution margin increased $9.0 million, largely due to improved price/mix in our vegetable business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses increased $35.7 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs.\nExcluding the Separation costs, fiscal 2019 SG&A expenses increased $44.4 million, or 15%, versus the prior year. The increase in SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, was largely driven by higher expenses related to information technology services and infrastructure, as well as investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. The increase was also driven by approximately $8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange (reflecting an approximate $3 million expense in fiscal 2019 compared to an approximate $5 million benefit in fiscal 2018), an approximate $2 million increase in incentive compensation expense that primarily reflected an increase in stock price and absolute shares outstanding, and an approximate $1 million increase in advertising and promotional support, partially offset by an approximate $4 million benefit from an insurance settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $107.1 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of $1.7 million compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in interest expense, net was the result of lower average total debt versus the prior year.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was impacted by the Tax Act enacted in December 2017. Notably, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that have not been taxed previously in the U.S., limited the tax deductibility of interest, provided for immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, modified or repealed many business deductions and credits, and created new taxes on certain future foreign-sourced earnings.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense, including the impact of the comparability items recorded in fiscal 2019 and 2018, related to the Tax Act, is as follows (in millions):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes and equity method earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n561.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n471.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity method investment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n620.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n554.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n133.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComparability items (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n149.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.5% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.8% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate, excluding comparability items (a) (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.9% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.0% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) In fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the one-time impacts of the Tax Act and we recorded a $2.4 million benefit for the true-up of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings. In connection with our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, we decreased income tax expense and increased net income $28.4 million, including a $39.9 million net provisional tax benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities with the new lower federal tax rate, partially offset by an $11.5 million transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings. \n (b) Since our fiscal year end is the last Sunday of May, in fiscal 2018, we phased in the impact of the lower tax rate, which after excluding comparability items, resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.0%. In fiscal 2019, the rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the impact of U.S. state and foreign taxes. \nFor further information on the Tax Act and its impact, see Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $59.5 million and $83.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts included a $2.6 million unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019, and a nominal unrealized loss related to the contracts in fiscal 2018. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments declined $21.6 million, compared to fiscal 2018, largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in Europe. For more information about our joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of Remaining 50.01% Interest in Lamb Weston BSW\nOn November 2, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the BSW Agreement\u201d) with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. ( Ochoa\u201d) to acquire the remaining 50.01% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, a potato processing joint venture. We paid Ochoa approximately $65 million in cash attributable to our contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW, plus $13.2 million attributable to Ochoa's interest in expected earnings of the joint venture through our fiscal year ended May 26, 2019.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, Lamb Weston BSW was considered a variable interest entity, and we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW and deducted 50.01% of the operating results of the noncontrolling interests to arrive at Net income\nattributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\u201d on our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings include 100% of Lamb Weston BSW's earnings beginning November 2, 2018, the date we entered into the BSW Agreement.\nPrior to entering into the BSW Agreement, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the value of Ochoa's put option. In connection with the purchase of the remaining 50.01% interest in the joint venture, we recorded $9.4 million of accretion, net of tax benefits, to increase the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the amount we agreed to pay. The purchase created $9.3 million of deferred tax assets related to the step-up in tax basis of the acquired assets. We recorded both the accretion of the noncontrolling interest and the related tax benefits in Additional distributed capital\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and they did not impact net income. While the accretion, net of tax benefits, had no impact on net income in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings, it reduced net income available to common stockholders $9.4 million, net of tax benefits, and both basic and diluted earnings per share $0.06, during fiscal 2019.\nAcquisition\nIn December 2018, we acquired a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of the fair value at the date of acquisition, of which $75.1 million was allocated to goodwill. Operating results of the acquired company subsequent to December 21, 2018 have been included in our Global segment.\nFiscal Year Ended May 27, 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2017\nNet Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions)\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct Contribution Margin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInc\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInc\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGlobal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,744.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,624.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n375.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n338.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFoodservice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,099.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,030.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n365.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n330.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRetail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n449.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n384.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n131.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,423.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,168.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n847.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n756.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nLamb Weston's net sales for fiscal 2018 increased $255.7 million, or 8%, to $3,423.7 million, compared with $3,168.0 million for fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase in price/mix and 2% increase in volume growth, with growth in each core operating segment.\nGlobal net sales increased $119.4 million, or 7%, to $1,744.2 million, compared with $1,624.8 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 5% increase in price/mix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets, as well as improved customer and product mix. Sales volumes increased 2%, primarily driven by organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains in North America. While net sales in international markets increased nominally, sales volumes declined as we chose to improve customer and product mix, as well as lower shipments to certain export markets.\nFoodservice net sales increased $69.1 million, or 7%, to $1,099.1 million, compared with $1,030.0 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6% increase related to favorable pricing, as well as actions to improve customer and product mix. Sales volume increased 1%, which was primarily related to growth of sales of Lamb Weston-\nbranded and operator label products to small and mid-sized restaurant chains, partially offset by lower sales volume of distributor label products.\nRetail net sales increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $449.2 million, compared with $384.9 million in fiscal 2017. Net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 12% increase in sales volume, driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products, as well as increased shipments of private label products. Price/mix increased 5%, reflecting higher prices across the branded and private label portfolios, as well as improved mix, partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products.\nNet sales in our Other segment increased $2.9 million, or 2%, to $131.2 million, compared with $128.3 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to favorable product mix in our vegetable business.\nProduct Contribution Margin\nGlobal product contribution margin increased $37.1 million, or 11%, to $375.7 million in fiscal 2018, as a result of favorable price/mix and volume growth. Global cost of sales was $1,361.8 million, or 6% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume, input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $0.9 million higher in 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased $35.2 million, or 11%, to $365.9 million in fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of favorable price/mix. Cost of sales was $724.7 million, or 5% higher in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in Richland, Washington, and higher compensation costs, partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.6 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017.\nRetail product contribution margin increased $9.7 million, or 13%, to $87.3 million in fiscal 2018 due to favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes. Cost of sales was $346.0 million, or 16% higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to higher volume and transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation. Advertising and promotion spending was $6.5 million higher in fiscal 2018, compared with fiscal 2017, as we invested behind the introduction of Grown In Idaho branded products.\nOther product contribution margin increased $9.7 million to $19.0 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of approximately $4 million related to our commodity option contracts and an expense in the prior year related to a recall of some vegetable products that were produced by a third party.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $38.9 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 included $8.7 million ($5.7 million after-tax) and $26.5 million ($16.7 million after-tax) of expenses for costs related to the Separation, primarily related to professional fees and other employee-related costs. Fiscal 2017 also included a $3.1 million ($2.0 million after-tax) non-cash gain on assets. Excluding these items, fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses increased $53.6 million, or 23%, versus the prior year largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation costs based on operating performance, and a $9.0 million increase in advertising and promotional support. In addition, the increase in SG&A expenses also included approximately $5 million to establish a new Lamb Weston charitable foundation, and approximately $4 million of costs related to transitioning our Foodservice segment go-to-market strategy from a broker-led sales model to a direct sales model.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $108.8 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $47.6 million compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense, net was the result of recognizing interest expense for a full-year for the debt incurred in connection with the Separation, compared with recognizing approximately only seven months of interest expense on this debt during fiscal 2017.\nFor more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. For the period prior to the Separation, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the Lamb Weston business, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome before income taxes and equity method earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n471.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n457.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity method investment earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n554.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n510.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n170.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Excluding $28.4 million of provisional impacts of the Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.0%. This rate varies from the fiscal 2018 U.S. corporate statutory tax rate of 29.3%, primarily due to the impact of U.S. state taxes, the domestic manufacturers deduction, foreign taxes, and other permanent differences. \nIn connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, income tax expense decreased $64.7 million; $36.3 million of the decrease related to a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and $28.4 million related to the provisional impacts of the Tax Act that was enacted in December 2017. For further information on the Tax Act and its impact, see Note 5, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $83.6 million and $53.3 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts included a nominal unrealized loss related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the current year, and a $3.6 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2017. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $33.9 million, driven by solid operating results in Europe and the U.S., including lower raw potato and production costs in Europe, volume growth, a $5.4 million foreign currency translation benefit, and an approximate $4 million gain related to a divestiture of a non-core business. The increase was partially offset by lower price/mix in Europe.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn fiscal 2019, cash from operations increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million. In addition to using cash for normal operating requirements, we invested in our business and returned cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2019, we spent $334.2 million on capital expenditures, including the construction of a new french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon, that\nadded 300 million pounds of additional annualized production capacity. We also used cash for acquisitions. We expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired, and we purchased the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston BSW joint venture for $78.2 million. Finally, we returned cash to shareholders, including $113.3 million in dividends and we repurchased 458,749 shares of our common stock for $31.8 million. We ended the year with $12.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $489.4 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. Currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, debt service, income tax payments, and stock repurchases.\nWe believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payment of any dividends declared on our common stock, for at least the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities (dollars in millions):\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended May\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n680.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n481.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n446.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(423.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(306.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(285.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(299.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(178.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(142.0)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(41.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(43.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $199.7 million to $680.9 million in fiscal 2019, compared with $481.2 million in fiscal 2018. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $161.5 million primarily due to favorable price/mix and sales volumes, and a decrease in cash taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $38.2 million more cash in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by the timing of payments for accounts payable, timing of receipt of cash for accounts receivable, a smaller year-over-year increase in prepaid expenses and current assets, and inventories. These changes were offset partially by the timing of payments for income taxes and accrued expenses.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nThe major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for non-cash income and expense items and changes in working capital. Cash generated from operating activities increased $34.3 million to $481.2 million in fiscal 2018, compared with $446.9 million in fiscal 2017. Earnings from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expense and other items, increased $91.4 million primarily due to favorable price/mix, and volume. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $57.1 million more cash in fiscal 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 due to increased sales and timing of collections, the timing of payments for\naccrued expenses relating to employee compensation and accrued interest in fiscal 2018, and the timing of payments for accounts payable. These cash outflows were offset partially by lower payments for income taxes, primarily related to the Tax Act.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nInvesting activities used $423.0 million of cash in fiscal 2019, compared with $306.8 million in fiscal 2018. These expenditures include the plant capacity expansions in Hermiston, Oregon in fiscal 2019 and Richland, Washington in fiscal 2018. Additionally, in December 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of a frozen potato processor in Australia for $88.6 million, net of cash acquired.\nWe expect capital investments in fiscal 2020 to be approximately $275 million, which excludes acquisitions. These expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. At May 26, 2019, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $41.5 million.\nIn July 2019, we acquired another frozen potato processor in Australia, for approximately $117 million, plus or minus final working capital adjustments. This added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nInvesting activities used $306.8 million of cash in fiscal 2018, compared with $285.3 million in fiscal 2017. These expenditures include plant capacity expansions at our Richland, Washington facility in fiscal 2018 and Boardman, Oregon facility in fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nDuring fiscal 2019, cash used for financing activities totaled $299.6 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $178.9 million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $113.3 million in dividends on our common stock, $78.2 million to acquire the noncontrolling interest in Lamb Weston BSW, $66.7 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility and the repayment of the Lamb Weston BSW installment notes, and $6.1 million of distributions paid to noncontrolling interest. Financing activities during 2019 also included the repurchase of 522,260 shares of our common stock, including restricted stock tax withholdings. Repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $36.4 million, including $31.8 million related to shares repurchased at an average price of $69.40 per share under our share repurchase program. In December 2018, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock. We will continue to repurchase shares, on an opportunistic basis, in open market repurchase transactions. As of July 15, 2019, $218.2 million remained authorized for purchase under the program.\nDuring fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings.\nOn June 28, 2019, we amended our credit agreement to refinance $300.0 million of the $599.1 million term loan facility outstanding at May 26, 2019 ( New Term Loan Agreement\u201d), for a lower overall interest rate, including anticipated patronage dividends. The New Term Loan Agreement bears interest, before anticipated patronage dividends, at LIBOR or\nthe Base Rate (each as defined in the New Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.625% to 2.375% for LIBOR-based loans and from 0.625% to 1.375% for Base Rate-based loans, depending upon our total net leverage ratio. The borrowings under the New Term Loan Agreement mature June 28, 2024, and the covenants, events of default, and guarantees are consistent with the Credit Facilities discussed in Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K. The amended credit agreement also provides for the ability, under certain circumstances, to add incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million. Our total term loan indebtedness remains the same before and after the refinancing.\nFor more information about our debt, including among other items, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. At May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our credit agreement.\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash used for financing activities totaled $178.9 million, compared with cash used for financing activities of $142.0 million in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, financing activities primarily related to the payment of $110.2 million in dividends on our common stock, $39.2 million of debt payments, primarily scheduled payments under our term loan facility, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest of $14.6 million, and $14.4 million of payments related to short-term borrowings. We had no net transfers to Conagra in fiscal 2018, compared with $38.8 million of net transfers in fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash used for financing activities primarily related to the Separation. In fiscal 2017, we issued $2,341.0 million of debt in connection with the Separation, of which $1,542.9 million of proceeds were distributed directly to Conagra (including $25.4 million that Conagra used to pay debt issuance costs) and are considered a noncash financing activity for Lamb Weston. We received $798.1 million of cash proceeds from the debt issuance. We used the $798.1 million of proceeds, together with borrowings on our revolving credit facility, to fund an $823.5 million cash payment to Conagra on the Separation Date. We paid $27.4 million of dividends to common stockholders, $12.3 million of debt issuance costs, and $2.8 million of net short-term borrowings. We made cash distributions to noncontrolling interest of $12.2 million and $23.8 million of debt repayments in fiscal 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 26, 2019 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nLamb Weston has interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities. For more information about our investments in joint ventures, see Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, potato supply agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum\nprices). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available.\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, are as follows. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table are estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt, including current portion, excluding financing obligations (b) (k)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,265.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n565.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,666.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt and financing obligations (c) (k)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n599.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n105.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n195.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n163.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n134.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases (d) (k)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n96.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing obligations, including current portion (e) (k)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n786.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n95.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n547.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital commitments (g)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther long-term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (h):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompensation and benefits (i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (j)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (k)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,927.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n285.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n906.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n272.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,463.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) The table assumes amounts included in the Less than 1 Year\u201d column represent obligations for our fiscal year 2020. The remaining columns correspond to our fiscal years as follows: 1-3 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2021 and 2022, 3-5 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2023 and 2024, and After 5 Years\u201d represents fiscal 2025 and thereafter. \n (b) The table is based on our long-term debt maturities at May 26, 2019, and includes the current portion of long-term debt. Amounts are reported gross. Balances have not been reduced by the $25.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs at May 26, 2019. \n (c) Amounts represent estimated future interest payments as of May 26, 2019, assuming our long-term debt and financing obligations are held to maturity and using interest rates in effect at May 26, 2019. \n (d) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. We lease some of our warehouses and operating facilities, as well as other property and equipment, under operating leases. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and/or if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. \n (e) The table is based on our financing obligation maturities at May 26, 2019, assumes our financing obligations are held to maturity, includes the current portion of financing obligations, and excludes interest payments associated with financing obligations. Amounts are reported gross. \n (f) Amount excludes purchase commitments under potato supply agreements due to uncertainty of pricing and quantity. Potato supply agreements have maximum contracted pricing with deductions for certain quality attributes, and quantities purchased are determined by the yields produced on contracted acres. Total purchases under all our potato supply agreements were $592.3 million, $595.8 million, and $596.1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \n (g) Capital commitments represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 26, 2019, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property. \n (h) Deferred income taxes of $125.7 million are excluded from this table, because the timing of their future cash outflows are uncertain. \n (i) Amounts consist of our pension, post-retirement obligations, cash-settled restricted stock unit obligations, and deferred compensation liabilities. Actuarially determined liabilities related to pension benefits are recorded based on estimates and assumptions. Key factors used in developing estimates of these liabilities include assumptions related to discount rates, expected rate of compensation increases, retirement and mortality rates, and other factors. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the measurement of funded status will impact the amounts reported. In the table above, we allocated our pension obligations by year based on the future required minimum pension contributions, as determined by our actuaries. See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits, and Note 11, Stock-based Compensation, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. \n (j) Long-term workers compensation of $8.5 million and uncertain tax positions of $22.3 million are excluded from this table because the timing of their future cash outflows are uncertain. Amount also excludes $12.0 million of a deferred gain as the amount is non-cash. \n (k) At the beginning of fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), and in June 2019, we amended our credit agreement and entered into a New Term Loan Agreement. In connection with these events, our total contractual obligations increased (decreased) as follows: \nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange in Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nASC 842 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n93.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(65.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(54.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt and financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) from ASC 842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew Term Loan Agreement (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt, including current portion, excluding financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(258.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n228.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt and financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) from New Term Loan Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(261.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n228.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) from ASC 842 and New Term Loan Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(258.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n220.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.

In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\nTo supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\nLamb Weston's management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures and Adjusted Diluted EPS to evaluate the Company's performance excluding the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods. The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the Company's operating performance and underlying prospects. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way. These measures are not a substitute for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income (loss) or diluted earnings per share, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
