Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d; the sections in Part I entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d; the selected financial data in Part II entitled Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nGeneral\nReal Estate Investment Trust\nWe are a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in the ownership, leasing and financing of convenience store and gasoline station properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 859 properties and leased 74 properties from third-party landlords. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal corporate income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our stockholders. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders each year.\nOur Triple-Net Leases\nSubstantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis primarily to petroleum distributors, convenience store retailers and, to a lesser extent, individual operators. Generally, our tenants supply fuel and either operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to operators who operate their convenience stores, gasoline stations, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses at our properties. Our triple-net tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases and in certain cases also for environmental contamination that existed before their leases commenced.\nSubstantially all of our tenants' financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products, convenience store sales or rental income from their subtenants. As a result, our tenants' financial results are highly dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry, which is highly competitive and subject to volatility. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our triple-net tenants by reviewing their published credit rating, if available, reviewing publicly available financial statements, or reviewing financial or other operating statements which are delivered to us pursuant to applicable lease agreements, monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and monitoring the timeliness of lease payments and the performance of other financial covenants under their leases. For additional information regarding our real estate business, our properties and environmental matters, see Item 1. Business - Company Operations\u201d, Item 2. Properties\u201d and Environmental Matters\u201d below.\nOur Properties\nNet Lease. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 918 of our properties to tenants under triple-net leases.\nOur net lease properties include 814 properties leased under 26 separate unitary or master triple-net leases and 104 properties leased under single unit triple-net leases. These leases generally provide for an initial term of 15 or 20 years with options for successive renewal terms of up to 20 years and periodic rent escalations. Several of our leases provide for additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold. In addition, certain of our leases require the tenants to invest capital in our properties.\nRedevelopment. As of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses.\nVacancies. As of December 31, 2018, nine of our properties were vacant. We expect that we will either sell or enter into new leases on these properties over time.\nInvestment Strategy and Activity\nAs part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related, properties, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. In addition to sale/leaseback and other real estate acquisitions, our investment activities include purchase money financing with respect to properties we sell, and real property loans relating to our leasehold portfolios. Our investment strategy seeks to generate current income and benefit from long-term appreciation in the underlying value of our real estate. To achieve that goal, we seek to invest in high quality individual properties and real estate portfolios that are in strong primary markets that serve high density population centers. A key element of our investment strategy is to invest in properties that will promote our geographic and tenant diversity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our April 17, 2018, acquisition of fee simple interests in 30 convenience store and gasoline station properties from GPM Investments, LLC ( GPM\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to GPM, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-\nterm triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $52.6 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. On August 1, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in six convenience store and gasoline station properties from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen PLC ( Applegreen\u201d), the largest convenience store and gasoline station operator in the Republic of Ireland. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $17.4 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the GPM and Applegreen transactions, in 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in five convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our September 6, 2017, acquisition of fee simple interests in 49 convenience store and gasoline station properties from Empire Petroleum Partners LLC ( Empire\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to Empire, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located primarily within metropolitan markets in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $123.1 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. On October 3, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 33 convenience store and gasoline station properties and five stand-alone Burger King quick service restaurants from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $68.7 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the Empire and Applegreen transactions, in 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 16 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $22.2 million.\nRedevelopment Strategy and Activity\nWe believe that certain of our properties are located in geographic areas which, together with other factors, may make them well-suited for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses, such as quick service restaurants, automotive parts and service stores, specialty retail stores and bank branch locations. We believe that the redeveloped properties can be leased or sold at higher values than their current use.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, rent commenced on six completed redevelopment projects that were placed back into service in our net lease portfolio. Since the inception of our redevelopment program in 2015, we have completed nine redevelopment projects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred $2.2 million of construction-in-progress to buildings and improvements on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. In addition, to the six properties currently classified as redevelopment, we are in various stages of feasibility and planning for the recapture of select properties from our net lease portfolio that are suitable for redevelopment to either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of December 31, 2018, we have signed leases on seven properties, that are currently part of our net lease portfolio, which will be recaptured and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.\nAsset Impairment\nWe perform an impairment analysis for the carrying amounts of our properties in accordance with GAAP when indicators of impairment exist. We reduced the carrying amounts to fair value, and recorded in continuing and discontinued operations, impairment charges aggregating $6.2 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, where the carrying amounts of the properties exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period which includes the estimated sales value expected to be received at disposition. The impairment charges were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties. The evaluation of and estimates of anticipated cash flows used to conduct our impairment analysis are highly subjective and actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Measures\nWe manage our business to enhance the value of our real estate portfolio and, as a REIT, place particular emphasis on minimizing risk, to the extent feasible, and generating cash sufficient to make required distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income each year. In addition to measurements defined by GAAP, we also focus on Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) to measure our performance. FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate our performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment charges and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Our definition of AFFO is defined as FFO less (i) Revenue Recognition Adjustments (net of allowances), (ii) changes in environmental estimates, (iii) accretion expense, (iv) environmental litigation accruals, (v) insurance reimbursements, (vi) legal settlements and judgments, (vii) acquisition costs expensed and (viii) other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different from ours and, accordingly, may not be comparable.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised our definition of AFFO to exclude three additional items - environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments - because we believe that these items are not indicative of our core operating performance. While we do not label excluded items as non-recurring, management believes that excluding items from our definition of AFFO that are either non-cash or not reflective of our core operating performance provides analysts and investors the ability to compare our core operating performance between periods. AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, has been restated to conform to our revised definition.\nWe believe that FFO and AFFO are helpful to analysts and investors in measuring our performance because both FFO and AFFO exclude various items included in GAAP net earnings that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, our core operating performance. FFO excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges. In our case, however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, adjustments recorded for recognition of rental income recognized from direct financing leases on revenues from rental properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenues from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The amortization of deferred lease incentives represents our funding commitment in certain leases, which deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue. GAAP net earnings and FFO include non-cash changes in environmental estimates and environmental accretion expense, which do not impact our recurring cash flow. GAAP net earnings and FFO also include environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments, which items are not indicative of our core operating performance. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include property acquisition costs expensed and other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired and are not reflective of our core operating performance.\nWe pay particular attention to AFFO, as we believe it best represents our core operating performance. In our view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of our core operating performance. By providing AFFO, we believe that we are presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess our core operating performance. Further, we believe that AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies. For a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to GAAP net earnings, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $15.0 million to $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $13.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in 2018 and the second half of 2017. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other\nmunicipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $16.7 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, professional fees, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to an increase in real estate taxes and property related professional fees.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.7 million increase in environmental legal fees and expenses, and a $1.9 million increase in net environmental remediation costs, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.2 million increase in employee related expenses and a $0.2 million increase in public company expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of properties acquired offset by a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gains were the result of the sale of nine and 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther income was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, other income was primarily attributable to $2.6 million received from insurance reimbursements. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and an increase in average interest rates on borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss from discontinued operations was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to earnings of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations were $0.6 million, as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations were $1.3 million, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of discontinued properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, FFO was $73.6 million, as compared to $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, AFFO was $69.7 million, as compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, was impacted by changes in net earnings, but excludes a $3.1 million decrease in impairment charges, a $4.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.9 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, also excludes a $6.3 million decrease in legal settlements and judgments, a $4.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.8 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals, and a $0.2 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.17 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.81 and $1.80 per share, respectively, as compared to $2.00 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.71 per share, as compared to $1.66 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017, compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $4.6 million to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $3.2 million and $1.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in the Empire and Applegreen transactions, respectively. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $15.8 million and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a decrease in rent, maintenance and state and local taxes.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were primarily attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, and reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $3.1 million, as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.8 million increase in environmental litigation accruals and legal fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in net environmental remediation costs. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.4 million decline in legal and professional fees and a $0.4 million decrease of non-recurring employee related expenses predominantly due to reductions in severance and retirement costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in employee related expenses.\nRecoveries and allowances for uncollectible accounts included in continuing operations increased by $0.6 million to a $0.2 million allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a recovery of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate offset by depreciation and amortization of properties acquired.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains were the result of the sale of 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which did not previously meet the criteria to be held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gains were primarily the result of the full recognition of the remaining deferred gain of $3.9 million resulting from the repayment of the entire seller financing mortgage by affiliates of Hanuman Business, Inc. (d/b/a Ramoco\u201d).\nOther income was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other income was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to $1.1 million received from insurance reimbursements and $0.5 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and the incurrence of new indebtedness required to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nWe report as discontinued operations properties which met the criteria to be accounted for as held for sale in accordance with GAAP as of June 30, 2014, and certain properties disposed of during the periods presented that were previously classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2014. Earnings from discontinued operations were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loss on dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there were two property dispositions recorded in discontinued operations. Impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, of $1.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of certain properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the directions of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO increased by $10.4 million to $74.6 million, as compared to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and AFFO increased by $4.9 million to $62.0 million, as compared to $57.1 million for the prior year. The increase in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to changes in net earnings but excludes a $3.5 million decrease in impairment charges, a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and a $5.2 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, also excludes a $5.9 million increase in legal settlements and judgments, a $0.7 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $0.2 million increase in environmental litigation accruals, a $0.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.1 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $1.4 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $2.00 per share, as compared to $1.87 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.66 per share, as compared to $1.67 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Revolving Facility which is scheduled to mature in March 2022, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents. Our business operations and liquidity are dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from our properties. We believe that our operating cash needs for the next twelve months can be met by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents.\nOur cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow (used in)/provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,931\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (206,217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow provided by/(used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow from operating activities increased by $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $63.3 million, as compared to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental and interest income less cash used for property costs, environmental expense, general and administrative expense and interest expense. The change in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations\u201d above.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities are primarily real estate-related transactions. Because we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to investments in real estate and our redevelopment activities. Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to a use of $75.9 million, as compared to a use of $206.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease of $136.0 million of property acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $3.4 million and an increase of $1.4 million in additions to construction in progress.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased by $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $40.5 million, as compared to a use of $157.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from issuances of common stock of $87.7 million, an increase in dividends paid of $11.2 million, an increase of $3.2 million in debt issuance costs and a decrease in net borrowings of $15.0 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into a $225.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate\u201d). The Credit Agreement consisted of a $175.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $50.0 million unsecured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d).\nOn March 23, 2018, we entered in to an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, as described below, the Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement, we (a) increased the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility from $175.0 million to $250.0 million, (b) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from June 2018 to March 2022, (c) extended the maturity date of the Term Loan from June 2020 to March 2023 and (d) amended certain financial covenants and provisions.\nSubject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or Term Loan to $600.0 million in the aggregate.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement incurs interest and fees at various rates based on our total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The Revolving Facility permits borrowings at an interest rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.30% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.30%. The annual commitment fee on the undrawn funds under the Revolving Facility is 0.15% to 0.25%. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.45% to 1.25% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.45% to 2.25%. The Term Loan does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance prior to its maturity.\nOn September 19, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) of our Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment modifies the Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reflect that we had previously entered into (a) an amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) and certain of its affiliates and (b) a note purchase and guarantee agreement with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d) and certain of its affiliates; and (ii) permit borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan at three different interest rates, including\na rate based on the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the Amendment) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amendment) for such facility.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a third amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement (the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our existing senior note purchase agreement with Prudential and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed that our (a) 6.0% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2021, in the original aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the Series A Notes\u201d), (b) 5.35% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023, in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (c) 4.75% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series C Notes\u201d) that were outstanding under the existing senior note purchase agreement would continue to remain outstanding under the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series D Notes\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, Series B Notes and Series C Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Notes prior to their respective maturities.\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MetLife and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series E Notes\u201d). The MetLife Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Series E Notes prior to its maturity.\nDebt Maturities\nThe amounts outstanding under our Restated Credit Agreement, Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, exclusive of extension options, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.95\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series C Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series D Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series E Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 380,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,364\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (842\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with all of the material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement.\nEquity Offering\nOn July 10, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters (the Underwriters\u201d), pursuant to which we sold to the Underwriters 4.1 million shares of common stock (the Equity Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds from the Equity Offering, including the full exercise by the Underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, of $104.3 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The net proceeds of the Equity Offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Facility and subsequently were used to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nATM Program\nIn June 2016, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. The 2016 ATM Program was terminated in January 2018.\nIn March 2018, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting\nas agents. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, as needed, from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 1.1 million and 0.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, and received net proceeds of $30.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us.\nProperty Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly review opportunities to acquire additional properties and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. We accounted for the acquisitions of fee simple interests as asset acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. For additional information regarding our property acquisitions, see Note 13 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe are reviewing select opportunities for capital expenditures, redevelopment and alternative uses for certain of our properties. We are also seeking to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio to redevelop such properties either for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nBecause we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to acquisitions. However, our tenants frequently make improvements to the properties leased from us at their expense. As of December 31, 2018, we have a remaining commitment to fund up to $7.6 million in the aggregate in capital improvements in certain properties previously leased to Marketing and now subject to unitary triple-net leases with other tenants.\nDividends\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws with the year beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends.\nIt is also possible that instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. Payment of dividends is subject to market conditions, our financial condition, including but not limited to, our continued compliance with the provisions of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and other factors, and therefore is not assured. In particular, the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the payment of dividends during certain events of default.\nCash dividends paid to our stockholders aggregated $50.5 million, $39.3 million and $36.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $4.4 million in stock dividends as part of a special dividend. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.\nContractual Obligations\nOur significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, were comprised of borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement (excluding extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs), operating and capital lease payments due to landlords, estimated environmental remediation expenditures and our funding commitments for capital improvements at certain properties which were previously leased to Marketing.\nIn addition, as a REIT, we are required to pay dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, exclusive of extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs, are summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less\nThan\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to\nThree\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three\nto\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More\nThan\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated environmental remediation expenditures (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital improvements (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 650,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> For our Restated Credit Agreement, which bears interest at variable rates, future interest expense was calculated using the cost of borrowing as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Estimated environmental remediation expenditures have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> The actual timing of funding of capital improvements is dependent on the timing of such capital improvement projects and the terms of our leases.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Exchange Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Although we have made estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding future uncertainties relating to the information included in our consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to the accounting policies selected and materiality, actual results could differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions and such differences could be material.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, real estate, receivables, deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The information included in our consolidated financial statements that is based on estimates, judgments and assumptions is subject to significant change and is adjusted as circumstances change and as the uncertainties become more clearly defined.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. The SEC's Financial Reporting Release ( FRR\u201d) No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies ( FRR 60\u201d), suggests that companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, income taxes, and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn revenue primarily from operating leases with our tenants. We recognize income under leases with our tenants, on the straight-line method, which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments evenly over the current term of the leases. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. A critical assumption in applying the straight-line accounting method is that the tenant will make all contractual lease payments during the current lease term and that the net deferred rent receivable balance will be collected when the payment is due, in accordance with the annual rent escalations provided for\nin the leases. We may be required to reserve, or provide reserves for a portion of, the recorded deferred rent receivable if it becomes apparent that the tenant may not make all of its contractual lease payments when due during the current term of the lease.\nDirect Financing Leases\nIncome under direct financing leases is included in revenues from rental properties and is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The investments in direct financing leases represents the investments in leased assets accounted for as direct financing leases. The investments in direct financing leases are increased for interest income earned and amortized over the life of the leases and reduced by the receipt of lease payments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nReal estate assets represent long-lived\u201d assets for accounting purposes. We review the recorded value of long-lived assets for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We may become aware of indicators of potentially impaired assets upon tenant or landlord lease renewals, upon receipt of notices of potential governmental takings and zoning issues, or upon other events that occur in the normal course of business that would cause us to review the operating results of the property. We believe our real estate assets are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated net realizable fair value amounts.\nEnvironmental Remediation Obligations\nWe provide for the estimated fair value of future environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. See Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information. Environmental liabilities net of related recoveries are measured based on their expected future cash flows which have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. Since environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate and knowledge about these liabilities is not known upon the occurrence of a single event, but rather is gained over a continuum of events, we believe that it is appropriate that our accrual estimates are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. A critical assumption in accruing for these liabilities is that the state environmental laws and regulations will be administered and enforced in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices. Environmental liabilities are estimated net of recoveries of environmental costs from state UST remediation funds, with respect to past and future spending based on estimated recovery rates developed from our experience with the funds when such recoveries are considered probable. A critical assumption in accruing for these recoveries is that the state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and that future environmental spending will be eligible for reimbursement at historical rates under these programs. We accrue environmental liabilities based on our share of responsibility as defined in our lease contracts with our tenants and under various other agreements with others or if circumstances indicate that our counterparty may not have the financial resources to pay its share of the costs. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenants or other counterparties fail to pay them. In certain environmental matters the effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. The ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims, if any, may be material to our results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.\nLitigation\nLegal fees related to litigation are expensed as legal services are performed. We provide for litigation accruals, including certain litigation related to environmental matters (see Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information), when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. If the estimate of the liability can only be identified as a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum of the range is accrued for the liability.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred federal income taxes because we elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws effective January 1, 2001. Our intention is to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be treated as a REIT and, as a result, we do not expect to pay substantial corporate-level federal income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. Certain states do not follow the federal REIT rules and we have included provisions for these taxes in property costs.\nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Properties Acquired\nUpon acquisition of real estate and leasehold interests, we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements) as if vacant\u201d and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of leasehold interests, above-market and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt. Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nGeneral\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment such as the remediation of known contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Environmental costs are principally attributable to remediation costs which are incurred for, among other things, removing USTs, excavation of contaminated soil and water, installing, operating, maintaining and decommissioning remediation systems, monitoring contamination and governmental agency compliance reporting required in connection with contaminated properties. We seek reimbursement from state UST remediation funds related to these environmental costs where available. The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The accrued liability is the aggregate of our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds.\nIn July 2012, we purchased a 10-year pollution legal liability insurance policy covering substantially all of our properties at that time for preexisting unknown environmental liabilities and new environmental events. The policy has a $50.0 million aggregate limit and is subject to various self-insured retentions and other conditions and limitations. Our intention in purchasing this policy was to obtain protection predominantly for significant events. No assurances can be given that we will obtain a net financial benefit from this investment. In addition to the environmental insurance policy purchased by the Company, we also took assignment of certain environmental insurance policies, and rights to reimbursement for claims made thereunder, from Marketing, by order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court during Marketing's bankruptcy proceedings. Under these assigned polices, we have received and expect to continue to receive reimbursement of certain remediation expenses for covered claims.\nWe enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant or other counterparty does not satisfy them. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases and other agreements if we determine that it is probable that our tenant or other counterparty will not meet its environmental obligations. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant or other counterparty fails to pay them. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants' histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nFor substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.\nWe anticipate that a majority of the USTs at properties previously leased to Marketing will be replaced over the next several years because these USTs are either at or near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such\ncontamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties. For properties that are vacant, we are responsible for costs associated with UST removals and for the cost of remediation of contamination found during the removal of USTs.\nIn the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed a reasonable estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a lease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.\nWe measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation (using a range of 2.0% to 2.75%), and then discount them to present value (using a range of 4.0% to 7.0%). We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2018, we had accrued a total of $59.8 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $14.5 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.3 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. As of December 31, 2017, we had accrued a total of $63.6 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $18.6 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $45.0 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.\nEnvironmental liabilities are accreted for the change in present value due to the passage of time and, accordingly, $2.4 million, $3.4 million and $4.1 million of net accretion expense was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in environmental expenses. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded credits to environmental expenses, included in continuing and discontinued operations, aggregating $1.3 million, $6.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively, where decreases in estimated remediation costs exceeded the depreciated carrying value of previously capitalized asset retirement costs. Environmental expenses also include project management fees, legal fees and environmental litigation accruals.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we increased the carrying values of certain of our properties by $5.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, due to changes in estimated environmental remediation costs. The recognition and subsequent changes in estimates in environmental liabilities and the increase or decrease in carrying values of the properties are non-cash transactions which do not appear on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCapitalized asset retirement costs are being depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the UST, a 10-year period if the increase in carrying value is related to environmental remediation obligations or such shorter period if circumstances warrant, such as the remaining lease term for properties we lease from others. Depreciation and amortization expense related to capitalized asset retirement costs in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were $4.3 million, $4.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Capitalized asset retirement costs were $45.7 million (consisting of $20.4 million of known environmental liabilities and $25.3 million of reserves for future environmental liabilities) as of December 31, 2018 and $45.4 million (consisting of $18.7 million of known environmental liabilities and $26.7 million of reserves for future environmental liabilities) as of December 31, 2017. We recorded impairment charges aggregating $3.9 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in continuing and discontinued operations for capitalized asset retirement costs.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates which are subject to significant change, and are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.\nOur estimates are based upon facts that are known to us at this time and an assessment of the possible ultimate remedial action outcomes. It is possible that our assumptions, which form the basis of our estimates, regarding our ultimate environmental liabilities\nmay change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Among the many uncertainties that impact the estimates are our assumptions, the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modifications of remediation plans, the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims, and possible changes in the environmental rules and regulations, enforcement policies, and reimbursement programs of various states.\nIn light of the uncertainties associated with environmental expenditure contingencies, we are unable to estimate ranges in excess of the amount accrued with any certainty; however, we believe that it is possible that the fair value of future actual net expenditures could be substantially higher than amounts currently recorded by us. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nEnvironmental Litigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had accrued $12.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively, for certain of these matters which we believe were appropriate based on information then currently available. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental litigation accruals. Matters related to our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal and the Lower Passaic River, our MTBE litigations in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, and our lawsuit with the State of New York pertaining to a property formerly owned by us in Uniondale, New York, in particular, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d; the sections in Part I entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d; the selected financial data in Part II entitled Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nGeneral\nReal Estate Investment Trust\nWe are a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in the ownership, leasing and financing of convenience store and gasoline station properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 859 properties and leased 74 properties from third-party landlords. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal corporate income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our stockholders. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders each year.\nOur Triple-Net Leases\nSubstantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis primarily to petroleum distributors, convenience store retailers and, to a lesser extent, individual operators. Generally, our tenants supply fuel and either operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to operators who operate their convenience stores, gasoline stations, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses at our properties. Our triple-net tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases and in certain cases also for environmental contamination that existed before their leases commenced.\nSubstantially all of our tenants' financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products, convenience store sales or rental income from their subtenants. As a result, our tenants' financial results are highly dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry, which is highly competitive and subject to volatility. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our triple-net tenants by reviewing their published credit rating, if available, reviewing publicly available financial statements, or reviewing financial or other operating statements which are delivered to us pursuant to applicable lease agreements, monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and monitoring the timeliness of lease payments and the performance of other financial covenants under their leases. For additional information regarding our real estate business, our properties and environmental matters, see Item 1. Business - Company Operations\u201d, Item 2. Properties\u201d and Environmental Matters\u201d below.\nOur Properties\nNet Lease. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 918 of our properties to tenants under triple-net leases.\nOur net lease properties include 814 properties leased under 26 separate unitary or master triple-net leases and 104 properties leased under single unit triple-net leases. These leases generally provide for an initial term of 15 or 20 years with options for successive renewal terms of up to 20 years and periodic rent escalations. Several of our leases provide for additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold. In addition, certain of our leases require the tenants to invest capital in our properties.\nRedevelopment. As of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses.\nVacancies. As of December 31, 2018, nine of our properties were vacant. We expect that we will either sell or enter into new leases on these properties over time.\nInvestment Strategy and Activity\nAs part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related, properties, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. In addition to sale/leaseback and other real estate acquisitions, our investment activities include purchase money financing with respect to properties we sell, and real property loans relating to our leasehold portfolios. Our investment strategy seeks to generate current income and benefit from long-term appreciation in the underlying value of our real estate. To achieve that goal, we seek to invest in high quality individual properties and real estate portfolios that are in strong primary markets that serve high density population centers. A key element of our investment strategy is to invest in properties that will promote our geographic and tenant diversity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our April 17, 2018, acquisition of fee simple interests in 30 convenience store and gasoline station properties from GPM Investments, LLC ( GPM\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to GPM, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-\nterm triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $52.6 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. On August 1, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in six convenience store and gasoline station properties from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen PLC ( Applegreen\u201d), the largest convenience store and gasoline station operator in the Republic of Ireland. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $17.4 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the GPM and Applegreen transactions, in 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in five convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our September 6, 2017, acquisition of fee simple interests in 49 convenience store and gasoline station properties from Empire Petroleum Partners LLC ( Empire\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to Empire, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located primarily within metropolitan markets in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $123.1 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. On October 3, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 33 convenience store and gasoline station properties and five stand-alone Burger King quick service restaurants from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $68.7 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the Empire and Applegreen transactions, in 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 16 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $22.2 million.\nRedevelopment Strategy and Activity\nWe believe that certain of our properties are located in geographic areas which, together with other factors, may make them well-suited for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses, such as quick service restaurants, automotive parts and service stores, specialty retail stores and bank branch locations. We believe that the redeveloped properties can be leased or sold at higher values than their current use.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, rent commenced on six completed redevelopment projects that were placed back into service in our net lease portfolio. Since the inception of our redevelopment program in 2015, we have completed nine redevelopment projects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred $2.2 million of construction-in-progress to buildings and improvements on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. In addition, to the six properties currently classified as redevelopment, we are in various stages of feasibility and planning for the recapture of select properties from our net lease portfolio that are suitable for redevelopment to either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of December 31, 2018, we have signed leases on seven properties, that are currently part of our net lease portfolio, which will be recaptured and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.\nAsset Impairment\nWe perform an impairment analysis for the carrying amounts of our properties in accordance with GAAP when indicators of impairment exist. We reduced the carrying amounts to fair value, and recorded in continuing and discontinued operations, impairment charges aggregating $6.2 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, where the carrying amounts of the properties exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period which includes the estimated sales value expected to be received at disposition. The impairment charges were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties. The evaluation of and estimates of anticipated cash flows used to conduct our impairment analysis are highly subjective and actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Measures\nWe manage our business to enhance the value of our real estate portfolio and, as a REIT, place particular emphasis on minimizing risk, to the extent feasible, and generating cash sufficient to make required distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income each year. In addition to measurements defined by GAAP, we also focus on Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) to measure our performance. FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate our performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment charges and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Our definition of AFFO is defined as FFO less (i) Revenue Recognition Adjustments (net of allowances), (ii) changes in environmental estimates, (iii) accretion expense, (iv) environmental litigation accruals, (v) insurance reimbursements, (vi) legal settlements and judgments, (vii) acquisition costs expensed and (viii) other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different from ours and, accordingly, may not be comparable.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised our definition of AFFO to exclude three additional items - environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments - because we believe that these items are not indicative of our core operating performance. While we do not label excluded items as non-recurring, management believes that excluding items from our definition of AFFO that are either non-cash or not reflective of our core operating performance provides analysts and investors the ability to compare our core operating performance between periods. AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, has been restated to conform to our revised definition.\nWe believe that FFO and AFFO are helpful to analysts and investors in measuring our performance because both FFO and AFFO exclude various items included in GAAP net earnings that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, our core operating performance. FFO excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges. In our case, however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, adjustments recorded for recognition of rental income recognized from direct financing leases on revenues from rental properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenues from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The amortization of deferred lease incentives represents our funding commitment in certain leases, which deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue. GAAP net earnings and FFO include non-cash changes in environmental estimates and environmental accretion expense, which do not impact our recurring cash flow. GAAP net earnings and FFO also include environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments, which items are not indicative of our core operating performance. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include property acquisition costs expensed and other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired and are not reflective of our core operating performance.\nWe pay particular attention to AFFO, as we believe it best represents our core operating performance. In our view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of our core operating performance. By providing AFFO, we believe that we are presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess our core operating performance. Further, we believe that AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies. For a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to GAAP net earnings, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $15.0 million to $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $13.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in 2018 and the second half of 2017. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other\nmunicipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $16.7 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, professional fees, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to an increase in real estate taxes and property related professional fees.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.7 million increase in environmental legal fees and expenses, and a $1.9 million increase in net environmental remediation costs, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.2 million increase in employee related expenses and a $0.2 million increase in public company expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of properties acquired offset by a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gains were the result of the sale of nine and 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther income was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, other income was primarily attributable to $2.6 million received from insurance reimbursements. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and an increase in average interest rates on borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss from discontinued operations was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to earnings of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations were $0.6 million, as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations were $1.3 million, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of discontinued properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, FFO was $73.6 million, as compared to $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, AFFO was $69.7 million, as compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, was impacted by changes in net earnings, but excludes a $3.1 million decrease in impairment charges, a $4.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.9 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, also excludes a $6.3 million decrease in legal settlements and judgments, a $4.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.8 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals, and a $0.2 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.17 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.81 and $1.80 per share, respectively, as compared to $2.00 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.71 per share, as compared to $1.66 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017, compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $4.6 million to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $3.2 million and $1.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in the Empire and Applegreen transactions, respectively. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $15.8 million and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a decrease in rent, maintenance and state and local taxes.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were primarily attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, and reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $3.1 million, as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.8 million increase in environmental litigation accruals and legal fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in net environmental remediation costs. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.4 million decline in legal and professional fees and a $0.4 million decrease of non-recurring employee related expenses predominantly due to reductions in severance and retirement costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in employee related expenses.\nRecoveries and allowances for uncollectible accounts included in continuing operations increased by $0.6 million to a $0.2 million allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a recovery of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate offset by depreciation and amortization of properties acquired.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains were the result of the sale of 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which did not previously meet the criteria to be held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gains were primarily the result of the full recognition of the remaining deferred gain of $3.9 million resulting from the repayment of the entire seller financing mortgage by affiliates of Hanuman Business, Inc. (d/b/a Ramoco\u201d).\nOther income was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other income was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to $1.1 million received from insurance reimbursements and $0.5 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and the incurrence of new indebtedness required to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nWe report as discontinued operations properties which met the criteria to be accounted for as held for sale in accordance with GAAP as of June 30, 2014, and certain properties disposed of during the periods presented that were previously classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2014. Earnings from discontinued operations were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loss on dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there were two property dispositions recorded in discontinued operations. Impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, of $1.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of certain properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the directions of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO increased by $10.4 million to $74.6 million, as compared to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and AFFO increased by $4.9 million to $62.0 million, as compared to $57.1 million for the prior year. The increase in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to changes in net earnings but excludes a $3.5 million decrease in impairment charges, a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and a $5.2 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, also excludes a $5.9 million increase in legal settlements and judgments, a $0.7 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $0.2 million increase in environmental litigation accruals, a $0.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.1 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $1.4 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $2.00 per share, as compared to $1.87 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.66 per share, as compared to $1.67 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Revolving Facility which is scheduled to mature in March 2022, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents. Our business operations and liquidity are dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from our properties. We believe that our operating cash needs for the next twelve months can be met by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents.\nOur cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow from operating activities increased by $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $63.3 million, as compared to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental and interest income less cash used for property costs, environmental expense, general and administrative expense and interest expense. The change in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations\u201d above.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities are primarily real estate-related transactions. Because we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to investments in real estate and our redevelopment activities. Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to a use of $75.9 million, as compared to a use of $206.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease of $136.0 million of property acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $3.4 million and an increase of $1.4 million in additions to construction in progress.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased by $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $40.5 million, as compared to a use of $157.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from issuances of common stock of $87.7 million, an increase in dividends paid of $11.2 million, an increase of $3.2 million in debt issuance costs and a decrease in net borrowings of $15.0 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into a $225.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate\u201d). The Credit Agreement consisted of a $175.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $50.0 million unsecured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d).\nOn March 23, 2018, we entered in to an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, as described below, the Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement, we (a) increased the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility from $175.0 million to $250.0 million, (b) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from June 2018 to March 2022, (c) extended the maturity date of the Term Loan from June 2020 to March 2023 and (d) amended certain financial covenants and provisions.\nSubject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or Term Loan to $600.0 million in the aggregate.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement incurs interest and fees at various rates based on our total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The Revolving Facility permits borrowings at an interest rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.30% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.30%. The annual commitment fee on the undrawn funds under the Revolving Facility is 0.15% to 0.25%. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.45% to 1.25% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.45% to 2.25%. The Term Loan does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance prior to its maturity.\nOn September 19, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) of our Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment modifies the Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reflect that we had previously entered into (a) an amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) and certain of its affiliates and (b) a note purchase and guarantee agreement with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d) and certain of its affiliates; and (ii) permit borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan at three different interest rates, including\na rate based on the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the Amendment) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amendment) for such facility.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a third amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement (the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our existing senior note purchase agreement with Prudential and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed that our (a) 6.0% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2021, in the original aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the Series A Notes\u201d), (b) 5.35% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023, in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (c) 4.75% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series C Notes\u201d) that were outstanding under the existing senior note purchase agreement would continue to remain outstanding under the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series D Notes\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, Series B Notes and Series C Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Notes prior to their respective maturities.\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MetLife and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series E Notes\u201d). The MetLife Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Series E Notes prior to its maturity.\nDebt Maturities\nThe amounts outstanding under our Restated Credit Agreement, Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, exclusive of extension options, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with all of the material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement.\nEquity Offering\nOn July 10, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters (the Underwriters\u201d), pursuant to which we sold to the Underwriters 4.1 million shares of common stock (the Equity Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds from the Equity Offering, including the full exercise by the Underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, of $104.3 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The net proceeds of the Equity Offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Facility and subsequently were used to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nATM Program\nIn June 2016, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. The 2016 ATM Program was terminated in January 2018.\nIn March 2018, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting\nas agents. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, as needed, from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 1.1 million and 0.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, and received net proceeds of $30.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us.\nProperty Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly review opportunities to acquire additional properties and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. We accounted for the acquisitions of fee simple interests as asset acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. For additional information regarding our property acquisitions, see Note 13 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe are reviewing select opportunities for capital expenditures, redevelopment and alternative uses for certain of our properties. We are also seeking to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio to redevelop such properties either for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nBecause we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to acquisitions. However, our tenants frequently make improvements to the properties leased from us at their expense. As of December 31, 2018, we have a remaining commitment to fund up to $7.6 million in the aggregate in capital improvements in certain properties previously leased to Marketing and now subject to unitary triple-net leases with other tenants.\nDividends\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws with the year beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends.\nIt is also possible that instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. Payment of dividends is subject to market conditions, our financial condition, including but not limited to, our continued compliance with the provisions of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and other factors, and therefore is not assured. In particular, the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the payment of dividends during certain events of default.\nCash dividends paid to our stockholders aggregated $50.5 million, $39.3 million and $36.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $4.4 million in stock dividends as part of a special dividend. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.\nContractual Obligations\nOur significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, were comprised of borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement (excluding extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs), operating and capital lease payments due to landlords, estimated environmental remediation expenditures and our funding commitments for capital improvements at certain properties which were previously leased to Marketing.\nIn addition, as a REIT, we are required to pay dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, exclusive of extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs, are summarized below (in thousands):\n\n (a) For our Restated Credit Agreement, which bears interest at variable rates, future interest expense was calculated using the cost of borrowing as of December 31, 2018. \n (b) Estimated environmental remediation expenditures have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. \n (c) The actual timing of funding of capital improvements is dependent on the timing of such capital improvement projects and the terms of our leases. Our commitments provide us with the option to either reimburse our tenants, or to offset rent when these capital expenditures are made. \nGenerally, leases with our tenants are triple-net leases with the tenant responsible for the operations conducted at our properties and for the payment of taxes, maintenance, repair, insurance, environmental remediation and other operating expenses.\nWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Exchange Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Although we have made estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding future uncertainties relating to the information included in our consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to the accounting policies selected and materiality, actual results could differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions and such differences could be material.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, real estate, receivables, deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The information included in our consolidated financial statements that is based on estimates, judgments and assumptions is subject to significant change and is adjusted as circumstances change and as the uncertainties become more clearly defined.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. The SEC's Financial Reporting Release ( FRR\u201d) No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies ( FRR 60\u201d), suggests that companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, income taxes, and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn revenue primarily from operating leases with our tenants. We recognize income under leases with our tenants, on the straight-line method, which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments evenly over the current term of the leases. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. A critical assumption in applying the straight-line accounting method is that the tenant will make all contractual lease payments during the current lease term and that the net deferred rent receivable balance will be collected when the payment is due, in accordance with the annual rent escalations provided for\nin the leases. We may be required to reserve, or provide reserves for a portion of, the recorded deferred rent receivable if it becomes apparent that the tenant may not make all of its contractual lease payments when due during the current term of the lease.\nDirect Financing Leases\nIncome under direct financing leases is included in revenues from rental properties and is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The investments in direct financing leases represents the investments in leased assets accounted for as direct financing leases. The investments in direct financing leases are increased for interest income earned and amortized over the life of the leases and reduced by the receipt of lease payments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nReal estate assets represent long-lived\u201d assets for accounting purposes. We review the recorded value of long-lived assets for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We may become aware of indicators of potentially impaired assets upon tenant or landlord lease renewals, upon receipt of notices of potential governmental takings and zoning issues, or upon other events that occur in the normal course of business that would cause us to review the operating results of the property. We believe our real estate assets are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated net realizable fair value amounts.\nEnvironmental Remediation Obligations\nWe provide for the estimated fair value of future environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. See Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information. Environmental liabilities net of related recoveries are measured based on their expected future cash flows which have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. Since environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate and knowledge about these liabilities is not known upon the occurrence of a single event, but rather is gained over a continuum of events, we believe that it is appropriate that our accrual estimates are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. A critical assumption in accruing for these liabilities is that the state environmental laws and regulations will be administered and enforced in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices. Environmental liabilities are estimated net of recoveries of environmental costs from state UST remediation funds, with respect to past and future spending based on estimated recovery rates developed from our experience with the funds when such recoveries are considered probable. A critical assumption in accruing for these recoveries is that the state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and that future environmental spending will be eligible for reimbursement at historical rates under these programs. We accrue environmental liabilities based on our share of responsibility as defined in our lease contracts with our tenants and under various other agreements with others or if circumstances indicate that our counterparty may not have the financial resources to pay its share of the costs. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenants or other counterparties fail to pay them. In certain environmental matters the effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. The ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims, if any, may be material to our results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.\nLitigation\nLegal fees related to litigation are expensed as legal services are performed. We provide for litigation accruals, including certain litigation related to environmental matters (see Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information), when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. If the estimate of the liability can only be identified as a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum of the range is accrued for the liability.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred federal income taxes because we elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws effective January 1, 2001. Our intention is to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be treated as a REIT and, as a result, we do not expect to pay substantial corporate-level federal income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. Certain states do not follow the federal REIT rules and we have included provisions for these taxes in property costs.\nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Properties Acquired\nUpon acquisition of real estate and leasehold interests, we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements) as if vacant\u201d and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of leasehold interests, above-market and below-market leases,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d; the sections in Part I entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d; the selected financial data in Part II entitled Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nGeneral\nReal Estate Investment Trust\nWe are a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) specializing in the ownership, leasing and financing of convenience store and gasoline station properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 859 properties and leased 74 properties from third-party landlords. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal corporate income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our stockholders. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders each year.\nOur Triple-Net Leases\nSubstantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis primarily to petroleum distributors, convenience store retailers and, to a lesser extent, individual operators. Generally, our tenants supply fuel and either operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to operators who operate their convenience stores, gasoline stations, automotive repair service facilities or other businesses at our properties. Our triple-net tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases and in certain cases also for environmental contamination that existed before their leases commenced.\nSubstantially all of our tenants' financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products, convenience store sales or rental income from their subtenants. As a result, our tenants' financial results are highly dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry, which is highly competitive and subject to volatility. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our triple-net tenants by reviewing their published credit rating, if available, reviewing publicly available financial statements, or reviewing financial or other operating statements which are delivered to us pursuant to applicable lease agreements, monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and monitoring the timeliness of lease payments and the performance of other financial covenants under their leases. For additional information regarding our real estate business, our properties and environmental matters, see Item 1. Business - Company Operations\u201d, Item 2. Properties\u201d and Environmental Matters\u201d below.\nOur Properties\nNet Lease. As of December 31, 2018, we leased 918 of our properties to tenants under triple-net leases.\nOur net lease properties include 814 properties leased under 26 separate unitary or master triple-net leases and 104 properties leased under single unit triple-net leases. These leases generally provide for an initial term of 15 or 20 years with options for successive renewal terms of up to 20 years and periodic rent escalations. Several of our leases provide for additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold. In addition, certain of our leases require the tenants to invest capital in our properties.\nRedevelopment. As of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses.\nVacancies. As of December 31, 2018, nine of our properties were vacant. We expect that we will either sell or enter into new leases on these properties over time.\nInvestment Strategy and Activity\nAs part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related, properties, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. In addition to sale/leaseback and other real estate acquisitions, our investment activities include purchase money financing with respect to properties we sell, and real property loans relating to our leasehold portfolios. Our investment strategy seeks to generate current income and benefit from long-term appreciation in the underlying value of our real estate. To achieve that goal, we seek to invest in high quality individual properties and real estate portfolios that are in strong primary markets that serve high density population centers. A key element of our investment strategy is to invest in properties that will promote our geographic and tenant diversity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our April 17, 2018, acquisition of fee simple interests in 30 convenience store and gasoline station properties from GPM Investments, LLC ( GPM\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to GPM, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-\nterm triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $52.6 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. On August 1, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in six convenience store and gasoline station properties from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen PLC ( Applegreen\u201d), the largest convenience store and gasoline station operator in the Republic of Ireland. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $17.4 million, which was funded with funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the GPM and Applegreen transactions, in 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in five convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. Included in these acquisitions was our September 6, 2017, acquisition of fee simple interests in 49 convenience store and gasoline station properties from Empire Petroleum Partners LLC ( Empire\u201d). These properties were simultaneously leased to Empire, a leading regional convenience store and gasoline station operator, under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located primarily within metropolitan markets in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas. The total purchase price for the transaction was $123.1 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. On October 3, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 33 convenience store and gasoline station properties and five stand-alone Burger King quick service restaurants from a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen. These properties were simultaneously leased to a U.S. subsidiary of Applegreen under a long-term triple-net unitary lease. The properties are located within the metropolitan market of Columbia, SC. The total purchase price for the transaction was $68.7 million, which was funded with a combination of funds from our Equity Offering and funds available under our Revolving Facility. In addition to the Empire and Applegreen transactions, in 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 16 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive properties in various transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $22.2 million.\nRedevelopment Strategy and Activity\nWe believe that certain of our properties are located in geographic areas which, together with other factors, may make them well-suited for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses, such as quick service restaurants, automotive parts and service stores, specialty retail stores and bank branch locations. We believe that the redeveloped properties can be leased or sold at higher values than their current use.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, rent commenced on six completed redevelopment projects that were placed back into service in our net lease portfolio. Since the inception of our redevelopment program in 2015, we have completed nine redevelopment projects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred $2.2 million of construction-in-progress to buildings and improvements on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were actively redeveloping six of our properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. In addition, to the six properties currently classified as redevelopment, we are in various stages of feasibility and planning for the recapture of select properties from our net lease portfolio that are suitable for redevelopment to either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of December 31, 2018, we have signed leases on seven properties, that are currently part of our net lease portfolio, which will be recaptured and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.\nAsset Impairment\nWe perform an impairment analysis for the carrying amounts of our properties in accordance with GAAP when indicators of impairment exist. We reduced the carrying amounts to fair value, and recorded in continuing and discontinued operations, impairment charges aggregating $6.2 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, where the carrying amounts of the properties exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period which includes the estimated sales value expected to be received at disposition. The impairment charges were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties. The evaluation of and estimates of anticipated cash flows used to conduct our impairment analysis are highly subjective and actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Measures\nWe manage our business to enhance the value of our real estate portfolio and, as a REIT, place particular emphasis on minimizing risk, to the extent feasible, and generating cash sufficient to make required distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income each year. In addition to measurements defined by GAAP, we also focus on Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) to measure our performance. FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate our performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment charges and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Our definition of AFFO is defined as FFO less (i) Revenue Recognition Adjustments (net of allowances), (ii) changes in environmental estimates, (iii) accretion expense, (iv) environmental litigation accruals, (v) insurance reimbursements, (vi) legal settlements and judgments, (vii) acquisition costs expensed and (viii) other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different from ours and, accordingly, may not be comparable.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, we revised our definition of AFFO to exclude three additional items - environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments - because we believe that these items are not indicative of our core operating performance. While we do not label excluded items as non-recurring, management believes that excluding items from our definition of AFFO that are either non-cash or not reflective of our core operating performance provides analysts and investors the ability to compare our core operating performance between periods. AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, has been restated to conform to our revised definition.\nWe believe that FFO and AFFO are helpful to analysts and investors in measuring our performance because both FFO and AFFO exclude various items included in GAAP net earnings that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, our core operating performance. FFO excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges. In our case, however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, adjustments recorded for recognition of rental income recognized from direct financing leases on revenues from rental properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenues from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The amortization of deferred lease incentives represents our funding commitment in certain leases, which deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue. GAAP net earnings and FFO include non-cash changes in environmental estimates and environmental accretion expense, which do not impact our recurring cash flow. GAAP net earnings and FFO also include environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments, which items are not indicative of our core operating performance. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include property acquisition costs expensed and other unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. Acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired and are not reflective of our core operating performance.\nWe pay particular attention to AFFO, as we believe it best represents our core operating performance. In our view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of our core operating performance. By providing AFFO, we believe that we are presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess our core operating performance. Further, we believe that AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies. For a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to GAAP net earnings, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $15.0 million to $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $13.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in 2018 and the second half of 2017. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $114.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other\nmunicipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $16.7 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, professional fees, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to an increase in real estate taxes and property related professional fees.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.7 million increase in environmental legal fees and expenses, and a $1.9 million increase in net environmental remediation costs, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was principally due to a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.2 million increase in employee related expenses and a $0.2 million increase in public company expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of properties acquired offset by a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The gains were the result of the sale of nine and 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther income was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, other income was primarily attributable to $2.6 million received from insurance reimbursements. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and an increase in average interest rates on borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLoss from discontinued operations was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to earnings of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations were $0.6 million, as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations were $1.3 million, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of discontinued properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, FFO was $73.6 million, as compared to $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, AFFO was $69.7 million, as compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, was impacted by changes in net earnings, but excludes a $3.1 million decrease in impairment charges, a $4.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.9 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2018, also excludes a $6.3 million decrease in legal settlements and judgments, a $4.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.8 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $1.1 million decrease in environmental litigation accruals, and a $0.2 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.17 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.81 and $1.80 per share, respectively, as compared to $2.00 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.71 per share, as compared to $1.66 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2017, compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues from rental properties increased by $4.6 million to $101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues from rental properties was primarily due to $3.2 million and $1.4 million of revenue from the properties acquired in the Empire and Applegreen transactions, respectively. Rental income contractually due from our tenants included in revenues from rental properties in continuing operations was $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements were $15.8 million and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income on notes and mortgages receivable was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include Revenue Recognition Adjustments comprised of non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Revenues from rental properties includes Revenue Recognition Adjustments which increased rental revenue by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProperty costs, which are primarily comprised of rent expense, real estate taxes, state and local taxes, municipal charges, maintenance expense and reimbursable tenant expenses, were $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in property costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a decrease in rent, maintenance and state and local taxes.\nImpairment charges included in continuing operations were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were primarily attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values, and reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties.\nEnvironmental expenses included in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $3.1 million, as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in environmental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.8 million increase in environmental litigation accruals and legal fees, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in net environmental remediation costs. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of changes in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was principally due to a $0.4 million decline in legal and professional fees and a $0.4 million decrease of non-recurring employee related expenses predominantly due to reductions in severance and retirement costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in employee related expenses.\nRecoveries and allowances for uncollectible accounts included in continuing operations increased by $0.6 million to a $0.2 million allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a recovery of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations and dispositions of real estate offset by depreciation and amortization of properties acquired.\nGains on dispositions of real estate were $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains were the result of the sale of 12 properties during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, which did not previously meet the criteria to be held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gains were primarily the result of the full recognition of the remaining deferred gain of $3.9 million resulting from the repayment of the entire seller financing mortgage by affiliates of Hanuman Business, Inc. (d/b/a Ramoco\u201d).\nOther income was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other income was primarily attributable to $1.8 million received from insurance reimbursements and $6.4 million received from legal settlements and judgments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to $1.1 million received from insurance reimbursements and $0.5 million received from legal settlements and judgments.\nInterest expense was $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and the incurrence of new indebtedness required to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nWe report as discontinued operations properties which met the criteria to be accounted for as held for sale in accordance with GAAP as of June 30, 2014, and certain properties disposed of during the periods presented that were previously classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2014. Earnings from discontinued operations were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Environmental credits recorded in discontinued operations was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loss on dispositions of real estate included in discontinued operations was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there were two property dispositions recorded in discontinued operations. Impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, of $1.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, were attributable to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of increases in estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of certain properties above their fair values. Environmental expenses and impairment charges vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the directions of changes for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO increased by $10.4 million to $74.6 million, as compared to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and AFFO increased by $4.9 million to $62.0 million, as compared to $57.1 million for the prior year. The increase in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to changes in net earnings but excludes a $3.5 million decrease in impairment charges, a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and a $5.2 million decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate. The increase in AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, also excludes a $5.9 million increase in legal settlements and judgments, a $0.7 million increase in insurance reimbursements, a $0.2 million increase in environmental litigation accruals, a $0.5 million increase in environmental estimates and accretion expense, a $0.1 million decrease in acquisition costs and a $1.4 million decrease in Revenue Recognition Adjustments.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $2.00 per share, as compared to $1.87 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.66 per share, as compared to $1.67 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our Revolving Facility which is scheduled to mature in March 2022, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents. Our business operations and liquidity are dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from our properties. We believe that our operating cash needs for the next twelve months can be met by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Restated Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program and available cash and cash equivalents.\nOur cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow (used in)/provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,931\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (206,217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flow provided by/(used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow from operating activities increased by $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $63.3 million, as compared to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental and interest income less cash used for property costs, environmental expense, general and administrative expense and interest expense. The change in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations\u201d above.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities are primarily real estate-related transactions. Because we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to investments in real estate and our redevelopment activities. Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to a use of $75.9 million, as compared to a use of $206.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease of $136.0 million of property acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $3.4 million and an increase of $1.4 million in additions to construction in progress.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased by $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $40.5 million, as compared to a use of $157.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from issuances of common stock of $87.7 million, an increase in dividends paid of $11.2 million, an increase of $3.2 million in debt issuance costs and a decrease in net borrowings of $15.0 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 2, 2015, we entered into a $225.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. (the Bank Syndicate\u201d). The Credit Agreement consisted of a $175.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and a $50.0 million unsecured term loan (the Term Loan\u201d).\nOn March 23, 2018, we entered in to an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, as described below, the Restated Credit Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement, we (a) increased the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility from $175.0 million to $250.0 million, (b) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from June 2018 to March 2022, (c) extended the maturity date of the Term Loan from June 2020 to March 2023 and (d) amended certain financial covenants and provisions.\nSubject to the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement and our continued compliance with its provisions, we have the option to (a) extend the term of the Revolving Facility for one additional year to March 2023 and (b) request that the lenders approve an increase of up to $300.0 million in the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or Term Loan to $600.0 million in the aggregate.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement incurs interest and fees at various rates based on our total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The Revolving Facility permits borrowings at an interest rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.50% to 1.30% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.30%. The annual commitment fee on the undrawn funds under the Revolving Facility is 0.15% to 0.25%. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.45% to 1.25% or a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.45% to 2.25%. The Term Loan does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance prior to its maturity.\nOn September 19, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) of our Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment modifies the Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) reflect that we had previously entered into (a) an amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential\u201d) and certain of its affiliates and (b) a note purchase and guarantee agreement with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ( MetLife\u201d) and certain of its affiliates; and (ii) permit borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan at three different interest rates, including\na rate based on the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the Amendment) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amendment) for such facility.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a third amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement (the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) amending and restating our existing senior note purchase agreement with Prudential and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed that our (a) 6.0% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2021, in the original aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the Series A Notes\u201d), (b) 5.35% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023, in the original aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (c) 4.75% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series C Notes\u201d) that were outstanding under the existing senior note purchase agreement would continue to remain outstanding under the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series D Notes\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, Series B Notes and Series C Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Notes prior to their respective maturities.\nOn June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with MetLife and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, we authorized and issued our 5.47% Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028, in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Series E Notes\u201d). The MetLife Note Purchase Agreement does not provide for scheduled reductions in the principal balance of the Series E Notes prior to its maturity.\nDebt Maturities\nThe amounts outstanding under our Restated Credit Agreement, Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and MetLife Note Purchase Agreement, exclusive of extension options, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.95\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series C Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series D Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series E Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 2028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 380,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized debt issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,364\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (842\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with all of the material terms of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement.\nEquity Offering\nOn July 10, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters (the Underwriters\u201d), pursuant to which we sold to the Underwriters 4.1 million shares of common stock (the Equity Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds from the Equity Offering, including the full exercise by the Underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, of $104.3 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The net proceeds of the Equity Offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Facility and subsequently were used to fund the Empire and Applegreen transactions.\nATM Program\nIn June 2016, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. The 2016 ATM Program was terminated in January 2018.\nIn March 2018, we established a new at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program\u201d), pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting\nas agents. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, as needed, from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 1.1 million and 0.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, and received net proceeds of $30.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us.\nProperty Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly review opportunities to acquire additional properties and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. We accounted for the acquisitions of fee simple interests as asset acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired fee simple interests in 103 convenience store and gasoline station, and other automotive related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $214.0 million. For additional information regarding our property acquisitions, see Note 13 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe are reviewing select opportunities for capital expenditures, redevelopment and alternative uses for certain of our properties. We are also seeking to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio to redevelop such properties either for a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $2.7 million of construction-in-progress costs related to our redevelopment activities. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $4.4 million to reimburse tenants for capital expenditures related to our redevelopment activities.\nBecause we generally lease our properties on a triple-net basis, we have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to acquisitions. However, our tenants frequently make improvements to the properties leased from us at their expense. As of December 31, 2018, we have a remaining commitment to fund up to $7.6 million in the aggregate in capital improvements in certain properties previously leased to Marketing and now subject to unitary triple-net leases with other tenants.\nDividends\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws with the year beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends.\nIt is also possible that instead of distributing 100% of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. Payment of dividends is subject to market conditions, our financial condition, including but not limited to, our continued compliance with the provisions of the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement and other factors, and therefore is not assured. In particular, the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement prohibit the payment of dividends during certain events of default.\nCash dividends paid to our stockholders aggregated $50.5 million, $39.3 million and $36.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $4.4 million in stock dividends as part of a special dividend. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.\nContractual Obligations\nOur significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, were comprised of borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement, the Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement, the MetLife Note Purchase Agreement (excluding extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs), operating and capital lease payments due to landlords, estimated environmental remediation expenditures and our funding commitments for capital improvements at certain properties which were previously leased to Marketing.\nIn addition, as a REIT, we are required to pay dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018, exclusive of extension options and unamortized debt issuance costs, are summarized below (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less\nThan\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One to\nThree\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three\nto\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More\nThan\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated environmental remediation expenditures (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital improvements (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 650,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) For our Restated Credit Agreement, which bears interest at variable rates, future interest expense was calculated using the cost of borrowing as of December 31, 2018. \n (b) Estimated environmental remediation expenditures have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. \n (c) The actual timing of funding of capital improvements is dependent on the timing of such capital improvement projects and the terms of our leases. Our commitments provide us with the option to either reimburse our tenants, or to offset rent when these capital expenditures are made. \nGenerally, leases with our tenants are triple-net leases with the tenant responsible for the operations conducted at our properties and for the payment of taxes, maintenance, repair, insurance, environmental remediation and other operating expenses.\nWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Exchange Act.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Although we have made estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding future uncertainties relating to the information included in our consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to the accounting policies selected and materiality, actual results could differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions and such differences could be material.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, real estate, receivables, deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The information included in our consolidated financial statements that is based on estimates, judgments and assumptions is subject to significant change and is adjusted as circumstances change and as the uncertainties become more clearly defined.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. The SEC's Financial Reporting Release ( FRR\u201d) No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies ( FRR 60\u201d), suggests that companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, income taxes, and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn revenue primarily from operating leases with our tenants. We recognize income under leases with our tenants, on the straight-line method, which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments evenly over the current term of the leases. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. A critical assumption in applying the straight-line accounting method is that the tenant will make all contractual lease payments during the current lease term and that the net deferred rent receivable balance will be collected when the payment is due, in accordance with the annual rent escalations provided for\nin the leases. We may be required to reserve, or provide reserves for a portion of, the recorded deferred rent receivable if it becomes apparent that the tenant may not make all of its contractual lease payments when due during the current term of the lease.\nDirect Financing Leases\nIncome under direct financing leases is included in revenues from rental properties and is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The investments in direct financing leases represents the investments in leased assets accounted for as direct financing leases. The investments in direct financing leases are increased for interest income earned and amortized over the life of the leases and reduced by the receipt of lease payments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nReal estate assets represent long-lived\u201d assets for accounting purposes. We review the recorded value of long-lived assets for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We may become aware of indicators of potentially impaired assets upon tenant or landlord lease renewals, upon receipt of notices of potential governmental takings and zoning issues, or upon other events that occur in the normal course of business that would cause us to review the operating results of the property. We believe our real estate assets are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated net realizable fair value amounts.\nEnvironmental Remediation Obligations\nWe provide for the estimated fair value of future environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. See Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information. Environmental liabilities net of related recoveries are measured based on their expected future cash flows which have been adjusted for inflation and discounted to present value. Since environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate and knowledge about these liabilities is not known upon the occurrence of a single event, but rather is gained over a continuum of events, we believe that it is appropriate that our accrual estimates are adjusted as the remediation treatment progresses, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. A critical assumption in accruing for these liabilities is that the state environmental laws and regulations will be administered and enforced in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices. Environmental liabilities are estimated net of recoveries of environmental costs from state UST remediation funds, with respect to past and future spending based on estimated recovery rates developed from our experience with the funds when such recoveries are considered probable. A critical assumption in accruing for these recoveries is that the state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and that future environmental spending will be eligible for reimbursement at historical rates under these programs. We accrue environmental liabilities based on our share of responsibility as defined in our lease contracts with our tenants and under various other agreements with others or if circumstances indicate that our counterparty may not have the financial resources to pay its share of the costs. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenants or other counterparties fail to pay them. In certain environmental matters the effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. The ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims, if any, may be material to our results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.\nLitigation\nLegal fees related to litigation are expensed as legal services are performed. We provide for litigation accruals, including certain litigation related to environmental matters (see Environmental Matters\u201d below for additional information), when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. If the estimate of the liability can only be identified as a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum of the range is accrued for the liability.\nIncome Taxes\nOur financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred federal income taxes because we elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws effective January 1, 2001. Our intention is to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be treated as a REIT and, as a result, we do not expect to pay substantial corporate-level federal income taxes. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend to eliminate any earnings and profits that were not distributed. Certain states do not follow the federal REIT rules and we have included provisions for these taxes in property costs.\nAllocation of the Purchase Price of Properties Acquired\nUpon acquisition of real estate and leasehold interests, we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements) as if vacant\u201d and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of leasehold interests, above-market and below-market leases,"}
