Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. Full House Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, may be referred to as Full House,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d or us\u201d.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary business is the ownership and/or operation of casino and related hospitality and entertainment facilities, which includes offering casino gambling, hotel accommodations, dining, golfing, RV camping, sports betting, entertainment and retail outlets, among other amenities. We own or operate five casino properties in four states - Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana and Nevada. We view our Mississippi, Colorado and Indiana properties as distinct operating segments and both of our Nevada properties as one operating segment.\nOur portfolio consists of the following:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hancock County, MS\n(near New Orleans)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cripple Creek, CO\n(near Colorado Springs)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rising Sun, IN\n(near Cincinnati)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockman's Casino\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fallon, NV\n(one hour east of Reno)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grand Lodge Casino (leased and part of the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incline Village, NV\n(North Shore of Lake Tahoe)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. While we provide credit at some of our casinos where we are permitted to by gaming regulations, most of our revenues are cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our revenues are primarily derived from slot machines, but also include other gaming activities, along with table games, keno and sports betting. In addition, we derive a significant amount of revenue from our hotels and our food and beverage outlets. We also derive revenues from our golf course and ferry boat service at Rising Star, our RV parks as owned at Rising Star and managed at Silver Slipper, and retail outlets and entertainment.\nWe often provide hotel rooms and food and beverages to customers on a complimentary basis. Prior to 2018, the retail value of such services was included in the respective revenue classifications and then deducted as promotional allowances to calculate net revenues. With the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard discussed below, amounts historically included in the promotional allowances line have been eliminated as they are now included as a contra-revenue, primarily reducing our casino revenues. Hence, beginning in 2018, our hotel, food and beverage revenues reflect the retail value of such services, including such services provided on a complimentary basis, while our casino revenues are net of the retail value of services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of results in future periods.\nOur market environment is highly competitive and capital-intensive. We rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. We also assess growth and development opportunities, which include capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nBronco Billy's Expansion. In 2018, we began our expansion of Bronco Billy's, which we anticipate completing in two phases. Phase One of the Bronco Billy's expansion project includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building, the purchase of the Imperial Hotel (which we acquired in June 2018) and certain other nearby parcels of land, and the reopening and rebranding of the Imperial Casino and Hotel as the Christmas Casino & Inn (which occurred in November 2018). Phase Two of the Bronco Billy's expansion project, which is expected to include a new luxury hotel tower, spa, convention and entertainment space, and two new restaurants, is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nDebt Refinancing. In February 2018, we issued $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds were used to fund the repayment of our outstanding First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities, the associated refinancing costs, and to provide for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes.\nRacetrack Proposal. The New Mexico Racing Commission (the Commission\u201d) recently announced a competitive process regarding the issuance of the state's sixth racing license. In accordance with that process, we formally presented our racetrack casino proposal ( La Posada del Llano\u201d) to the Commission in October 2018 and answered additional questions regarding our project in November 2018. If selected by the Commission, La Posada del Llano is expected to include a racetrack featuring a unique Moving Grandstand,\u201d an 18-hole championship golf course, a casino with up to 750 slot machines, and a 300-guestroom hotel, among other amenities. Due to litigation filed against the Commission by one of the other applicants, it is uncertain when the Commission will make a decision regarding the issuance of the racetrack license.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use several key performance indicators to evaluate the operations of our properties. These key performance indicators include the following:\nGaming revenue indicators:\nSlot coin-in is the gross dollar amount wagered in slot machines and table game drop is the total amount of cash or credit exchanged into chips at table games for use by our customers. Slot coin-in and table game drop are indicators of volume.\nSlot win is the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines. Table game hold is the difference between the amount of money or markers exchanged into chips at the tables and customer winnings paid. Slot win and table game hold percentages represent the relationship between slot win and coin-in and table game win and drop.\nRoom revenue indicators:\nHotel occupancy rate is an indicator of the utilization of our available rooms. Complimentary room sales, or the retail value of accommodations furnished to customers free of charge, are included in the calculation of the hotel occupancy rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin:\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our performance. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA see Non-GAAP Measure.\u201d We utilize Adjusted Property EBITDA as the measure of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Additionally, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted Property EBITDA by the property's net revenues.\nResults of Operations - 2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated operating results\nThe following summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606 for Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d or Note 2,\u201d for more information regarding this new revenue recognition standard, as well as a summary of its effects on our revenues and expenses. We do not expect that this new revenue recognition standard will have an aggregate material impact on operating income, net income, or cash flows on an ongoing basis. However, due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly between years due to reclassifications between the various departments, in addition to other changes discussed in Note 2.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Difference\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>156,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>7,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other non-operating expenses, net\n</td> <td>11,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(417.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,371\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which are comprised of casino and non-casino operations. Non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 are shown below as net of promotional allowances. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect the new accounting standard, where the retail value of complimentary services is a reduction to casino revenues, while non-casino revenues reflect the retail value of both complimentary and non-complimentary services. The table shows that most of the differences between the periods in each of these categories is related to the implementation of ASC 606.

For further discussions, refer to Operating results - reportable segments\u201d below.\nRevenues. As indicated in the above table, net revenues increased 1.6%, despite the $0.9 million impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The accounting change had the greatest impact on net revenues for Grand Lodge Casino, a part of our Northern Nevada segment, as third-party payments for hotel guestrooms, food, and beverages are now classified as offsets to casino revenue; whereas in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under legacy revenue recognition standards. Rising Star was the least affected by ASC 606 during the year, but had declines in net revenues due to significant weather issues particularly in the first quarter, which reduced gaming volumes for the local casino market in southeastern Indiana as a whole.\nOur other properties achieved gains from improved marketing and a full year's worth of new amenities and other improvements, as well as significantly improved weather in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net revenues at Bronco Billy's increased due to the acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018 and Imperial Casino in August 2018 (collectively rebranded in November 2018 as the Christmas Casino & Inn), a full year of the Crippled Cow restaurant (which opened in mid-2017), and increased covers at other venues. At Silver Slipper, new marketing initiatives helped increase net revenues in both gaming and non-gaming operations, as did a full year of operations at the property's new Beach Club and Oyster Bar.\nOperating expenses. Expenses for individual departments varied significantly due to the new revenue recognition standard, which no longer requires us to reclassify the estimated cost of providing complimentaries to a gaming customer from other expense categories to casino expenses. See Note 2 for more details regarding the new revenue recognition standard, which impacted reporting for casino expenses by $(30.2) million, food and beverage expenses by $26.3 million, hotel expenses by $9.0 million, and other operations by $1.4 million. Additionally, operating expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes, through both additional guests and a full-year of additional amenities, as described in further detail in the segment section below. Marketing expenses also increased, primarily at Bronco Billy's due to improvements in the loyalty program.\nApart from the new revenue recognition standard, project development and acquisition costs increased by $0.6 million during 2018, reflecting our participation in the competitive process to develop a racetrack casino in New Mexico, our development efforts in Terre Haute, and elsewhere. Preopening costs increased by $0.3 million and were related to our new ferry boat operations at Rising Star and the Christmas Casino & Inn launch at Bronco Billy's.\nInterest and other non-operating expense, net.\nInterest Expense\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost (excluding loan fee amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs and discount\n</td> <td>790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of interest rate cap agreement\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>(346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in February 2018, which resulted in a lower effective interest rate than our prior credit facilities, and increased capitalization of interest expense during 2018 from our growth projects.\nOther non-operating expense, net\nDuring 2018, we incurred $1.0 million of other non-operating expense due primarily to the February 2018 refinancing of our prior credit facilities, which resulted in a $2.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt. This expense was partly offset by a $1.7 million gain from the non-cash fair value adjustment of our common stock warrant liability. The common stock warrant liability is adjusted to fair value each quarter. During 2017, other non-operating expense was $1.4 million, due to the fair value adjustments to our warrants. The decrease in fair value during 2018 primarily related to the decrease in our share price during that period.\nIncome taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was (12.2)% and 2.9%, respectively. Our tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the effects of changes in tax law, changes in valuation allowance, and items that are permanently treated differently for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and tax purposes. During 2018, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of any available deferred tax liabilities. In future years, if it is determined that we meet the more likely than not\u201d threshold of utilizing our deferred tax assets, we may reverse some or all of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted which, beginning in 2018, reduced the maximum corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. As of the date of enactment, we reduced our federal deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the new statutory rate, resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.9 million in 2017.\nAdditionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Tax Act currently available. This resulted in no additional SAB 118 tax benefit or cost for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe do not expect to pay any federal income taxes or receive any federal tax refunds related to our 2018 results of operations. Tax losses incurred in 2018 may shelter taxable income in future years, but because of the level of uncertainty regarding sufficient prospective taxable income, we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as mentioned above.\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, for a more detailed discussion.\nOperating results - reportable segments\nWe manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States. Accordingly, Stockman's and Grand Lodge Casino comprise our Northern Nevada business segment, while Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy's and Rising Star are currently distinct segments. With the addition of ferry boat operations in September 2018, our Rising Star segment now includes ferry boat operations between Indiana and Kentucky. In November 2018, we opened the Christmas Casino & Inn in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is included in the Bronco Billy's segment.\nThe following table presents detail by segment of our consolidated net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as its measure of segment profit. The comparability of the information for the periods presented was not materially affected by the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>47,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>26,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Nevada Casinos\n</td> <td>19,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>3,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Nevada Casinos\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Property EBITDA\n</td> <td>22,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(4,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSilver Slipper Casino and Hotel\nNet revenues increased during 2018 due to successful marketing initiatives, the addition of sports book operations in August 2018, the ramp-up of new amenities that opened in mid-2017, and improved weather versus the prior year, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nUnder the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly due to reclassifications between the various departments, as well as other changes discussed in Note 2. Apart from this accounting change, slot revenues, which accounted for approximately 88% of our casino revenue, increased by 6.3%. Meanwhile, table games revenue increased by 5.8%.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues grew 7.4% during the year. Hotel occupancy was 91.7% compared to 88.3% in the prior year. In addition to the sports book operations mentioned above, 2018 also reflects a full year of new amenities at the property, including the Beach Club and the Oyster Bar, which both opened in mid-2017.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA increased by 13.0% to $12.1 million in 2018, primarily from the growth in net revenue described above. Of note, Adjusted Property EBITDA in September 2017 included settlement proceeds of $675,000 related to the conclusion of litigation for construction defects at our parking garage, of which there was no comparable non-recurring credit or charge in 2018. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 17.5% in 2018 compared to 16.8% in 2017.\nRising Star Casino Resort\nNet revenues decreased during 2018 due to adverse weather conditions, most notably during the first quarter from approximately 21 days of heavy snowfall, as well as two days when the casino was closed due to the flooding of nearby access roads. This affected guest volumes, as reflected in a 3.6% decrease of slot coin-in during the year.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues decreased by 2.7% and table games revenues decreased by 10.3% due to lower volumes, while promotional allowances decreased by 7.9%. Non-gaming net revenues decreased by 2.0% during 2018, in part reflecting a temporary reduction in the number of available room-nights due to hotel improvements during the year. Average daily room rate remained flat.\nThough our net revenues decreased compared to prior year, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased to $2.8 million from $2.7 million due to improved efficiencies driven by new management, a focus on cost controls, and savings from streamlining labor.\nDuring the second half of 2018, we completed certain maintenance and growth-related capital expenditure projects, which were designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation, revenue and income growth. In July 2018, we completed improvements made to the entry pavilion and the adjoining hotel's lobby and hallways. In September 2018, we completed the new access roads to the ferry landing sites and commenced implementation of a 10-vehicle ferry boat service to Kentucky as mentioned above, which significantly shortened the distance for customers traveling from the more populous Boone County, Kentucky to Rising Star. We invested a total of approximately $4.9 million with respect to the foregoing improvements at Rising Star in 2018.\nBronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\nHigher gaming volumes, new restaurant outlets, and the opening of the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn resulted in increases to both our casino revenues and non-gaming revenues in 2018, as discussed in more detail below.\nAbsent the accounting change noted above, slot revenues increased slightly by 0.3% due to higher volumes brought on by the opening of our Christmas Casino in November 2018. However, table games revenue decreased by 1.6% due to lower volumes.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues increased by 5.7% during 2018, reflecting a full year of revenue generated from the Crippled Cow outlet, which opened in mid-2017, as well as Rudy's Diner and an additional bar at the Christmas Casino, which opened in November 2018. Hotel revenues increased by 18.4% resulting from our acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, which increased the total number of hotel rooms at Bronco Billy's from 24 to 36 guestrooms. In November 2018, we rebranded the Imperial Hotel and reopened the Imperial Casino, together as the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA decreased by 17.6% due to rising operational costs. These costs included higher promotional expenses related to changes in the accruals for the property's loyalty marketing program. Operational costs were also affected by an increase in the state's minimum wage, as well as the additional labor needed for the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAs discussed in the Executive Overview\u201d and Liquidity & Capital Resources\u201d sections, progress continues on our planned expansion of Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel.\nNorthern Nevada\nOur Northern Nevada operations have historically been seasonal, with the summer months accounting for a disproportionate share of its annual revenues. Additionally, snowfall levels during the winter months also frequently have a positive or negative effect. Grand Lodge Casino is located near several ski resorts, including Alpine Meadows, Northstar and Squaw Valley. Normally, we benefit from a good\u201d snow year, resulting in extended periods of operation at the nearby ski areas.\nNet revenues decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. The impact is different here than at our other properties, as many of the complimentary services we provide to our customers are paid for by us, but are actually provided by our landlord, Hyatt. During 2018, promotional allowances provided by third-parties (principally Hyatt) were directly netted against casino revenues at Grand Lodge Casino, while in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under the prior revenue recognition standards. A similar reclassification was related to the use of hotel rooms at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe, which we provided to gaming customers on a complimentary basis.\nAt Stockman's Casino, construction at the nearby Navy base adversely affected business, as fewer air training groups were in town, which led to a decline in gaming volume.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues in our Northern Nevada division increased, with both slot coin-in and win increasing and slot hold percentage remaining relatively flat. Though table games revenue decreased slightly, our overall casino revenue increased during the year by 1.6%.\nRegarding non-gaming net revenues, which within the division are primarily at Stockman's, food and beverage revenue increased by 9.7%, reflecting the completion of construction at the property and improved products.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA in Northern Nevada increased by 21.0%, reflecting the completion of a significant renovation of Grand Lodge Casino in mid-2017, as well as exterior improvements, improved parking access at Stockman's Casino, and a focus on controlling costs. Additionally, an improved ski season at Grand Lodge Casino in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited results.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses increased slightly by 1.9% in 2018 due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, and salaries and benefits.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as supplemental disclosure to measures reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) because management believes this measure is (i) a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industries and (ii) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. In addition, a version of Adjusted EBITDA (known as Consolidated EBITDA) is utilized in the covenants within our indenture, although not necessarily defined in the same way as above. Adjusted EBITDA is not, however, a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, this measure should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flows as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

rents related to: (i) Silver Slipper of $1.6 million in 2018 and $1.5 million in 2017, (ii) Northern Nevada segment of $1.9 million in both 2018 and 2017, and (iii) Bronco Billy's of $0.4 million in 2018 and $0.3 million in 2017. Capital lease payments of $0.7 million during both 2018 and 2017 related to Rising Star's smaller hotel are not deducted, as such payments are accounted for as interest expense and amortization of debt related to the capitalized lease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $20.6 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents. Management currently estimates that approximately $10 million of cash and equivalents is currently required for our day-to-day operations.\nOur casinos are our primary sources of income and operating cash flows. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. Subject to the effects of the economic uncertainties discussed herein, we believe that adequate financial resources (including from operating cash flows and external debt and equity financing) will be available to fund ongoing operating requirements over the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurances of our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth efforts.\nCash flows - operating activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operations during 2018 was $9.8 million compared to $7.1 million in 2017. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but are also affected by changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, prepaid expenses, and payables. The increase in our operating cash flows during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the increase in our operating income and working capital timing differences.\nCash flows - investing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash used in investing activities during 2018 was $17.4 million, which primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including our new ferry boat service at Rising Star, the refurbishment and rebranding of the Christmas Casino & Inn, and development work for the Bronco Billy's expansion, as well as the purchase of the Imperial Hotel and other land adjacent to Bronco Billy's. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was $11.2 million and primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including the Silver Slipper Beach Club, the Oyster Bar at Silver Slipper, and the refurbishment of Grand Lodge Casino.\nCash flows - financing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was $8.3 million, which primarily related to the proceeds from the registered direct equity offering that we completed in March 2018 and offset by payments related to the refinancing of our credit facilities, loan and lease principal payments, and purchase of an interest rate cap. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was $3.1 million, primarily related to $2.2 million of First Lien Term Loan payments.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWe have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our interest requirements and maintain our properties. Our debt matures in February 2024 and we anticipate needing to refinance our debt prior to its maturity, as we are unlikely to generate sufficient cash flow in the interim and be debt-free by such date. Our planned capital expenditures designed to grow the Company will require additional financing, including perhaps, the issuance of additional debt and potentially some form of equity financing. Our operations are subject to financial, economic, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow and/or access the capital markets, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying, or eliminating certain planned capital expenditures, selling assets, obtaining additional equity financing, or borrowing at higher costs of capital.\nLong-Term Debt. At December 31, 2018, we had $99.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding from the original $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the Notes offering were used to pay off all of our outstanding First and Second Lien Credit Facilities, pay for costs associated with the refinancing, provide ongoing working capital, provide funds for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. We currently estimate, based on current LIBOR rates, that our cash interest expense in 2019 will be approximately $10 million, including the interest component of our capital lease. This estimate is based on our total outstanding debt and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months.\nInterest Rate Cap Agreement. In connection with the refinancing, we purchased an interest rate cap ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) for $238,000 on April 6, 2018. We entered into this interest rate derivative with Capital One, N.A. to minimize the effect of interest rate increases on approximately half of our outstanding borrowings with a notional amount of $50 million and strike rate of 3.00%, which resets every three months at the end of March, June, September, and December. The Interest Rate Cap expires on March 31, 2021 and is presented accordingly on our consolidated balance sheet under Deposits and other\u201d as a non-current asset. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCommon Stock Warrants. In 2016, we granted the lenders under the former Second Lien Credit Facility (the Second Lien Lenders\u201d) warrants representing rights to purchase approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at $1.67 per share, the average trading price of our common stock during a 60-day period bracketing the date of issuance. The warrants include redemption rights which allow the warrant-holders, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the warrants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The refinancing of the Second Lien Credit Facility in February 2018 qualified as a triggering event. As of the date of this filing, the Second Lien Lenders have not exercised these redemption rights, though they may do so on any six-month anniversary of the refinancing date prior to warrant expiration in May 2026. If they do exercise their redemption rights, we have the option of paying them in cash or with a four-year note on terms stipulated in the warrant agreement. Alternatively, the warrant-holders may choose to have us register and sell the shares related to the warrants through a public offering. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information associated with these warrants which could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nHyatt Option to Purchase our Leasehold Interest and Related Assets. Our lease with Hyatt to operate the Grand Lodge Casino contains an option for Hyatt, as of January 1, 2019, to purchase our leasehold interest and related casino operating assets. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information about this option and related rental commitments that could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nCapital Investments. We have made significant investments through 2018 and expect to make additional capital investments during 2019 and beyond. These investments are designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation at our properties, revenue and income growth.\nBronco Billy's - As discussed above in the Executive Overview,\u201d we began Phase One of the two-phase expansion of our Bronco Billy's property with our purchase of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, along with other nearby parcels of land, and our lease of the Imperial Casino in August 2018. In November 2018, we reopened the Imperial Hotel and Casino as the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn. The remainder of Phase One includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building. We estimate that the total cost for Phase One of the expansion is approximately $20 million, which is expected to be funded from cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations. We have invested approximately $5 million in total for Phase One, and expect to invest the balance of $15 million in 2019. We expect to commence construction of the parking garage in the first half of 2019 and to complete such construction by the end of 2019. For Phase Two, we continue to discuss amenities, fixtures, and other related topics with our architects and general contractor in our efforts to execute a guaranteed maximum price contract and finalize an overall budget for the project. We currently expect to begin Phase Two upon the conclusion of Phase One, with completion of the entire expansion project expected in 2021. However, construction of Phase Two is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nSilver Slipper - We are planning to remodel the Silver Slipper casino in the second quarter of 2019, which will be the property's first significant renovation since it opened in 2006. We do not expect renovations to disrupt operations, as our upgrades to the carpeting, wallpaper, and seating within the buffet will occur during periods of low guest traffic. The estimated cost of this renovation is less than $1 million.\nOther Capital Expenditures - Additionally, we may fund various other capital expenditure projects, depending on our financial resources. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate due to decisions regarding strategic capital investments in new or existing facilities, and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. No assurance can be given that any of our planned capital expenditure projects will be completed or that any completed projects will be successful. Our annual capital expenditures typically include some number of new slot machines and related equipment; to some extent, we can coordinate such purchases to match our resources.\nWe evaluate projects based on a number of factors, including profitability forecasts, length of the development period, the regulatory and political environment, and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development or acquisition, among other considerations. No assurance can be given that any additional projects will be pursued or completed or that any completed projects will be successful.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements\nSenior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn February 2, 2018, we refinanced amounts previously outstanding of $41 million under the First Lien Credit Facility and $55 million under the Second Lien Credit Facility with $100 million of Notes, which we sold to qualified institutional buyers. The Notes are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries.\nThe Notes bear interest at the greater of the three-month LIBOR or 1.0%, plus a margin rate of 7.0%. The indenture governing the Notes provides for a 50 basis point interest premium if Mr. Lee reduces his equity interests by 50% or more while serving as our CEO. Mr. Lee has no current intention to sell any shares. During the fourth quarter, he purchased 15,000 shares on the open market. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year until the Notes mature in February 2024. On each interest payment date, we are required to make principal payments of $250,000 with a balloon payment for the remaining $94 million due upon maturity.\nMandatory prepayments of the Notes will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price may be prepaid at 102% of par through February 1, 2020; 101.5% through February 1, 2021; 100.5% through February 1, 2022; and 100% thereafter.\nCovenants\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As defined in the indenture, we are required to maintain a total leverage ratio, which measures Consolidated EBITDA\u201d against outstanding net debt. Additionally, we are allowed to deduct up to $15 million of our cash and equivalents (beyond estimated cash utilized in daily operations) in calculating the numerator of such ratio. For the upcoming year, the total leverage covenant ratio requirements are 5.00x through June 30, 2019 and 4.75x through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our covenants; however, there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with all covenants in the future. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our Notes due 2024.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore, actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nOur long-lived assets include property and equipment, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangibles, and are evaluated at least annually (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances that might indicate impairment testing is warranted might include, as applicable, an adverse change in the legal, regulatory or business climate relative to gaming nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or a significant long-term decline in historical or forecasted earnings or cash flows or the fair value of our property or business, possibly as a result of competitive or other economic or political factors. In evaluating whether a loss in value is other than temporary, we consider: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value or market value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the casino property, including any specific events which may influence the operations; (iii) our intent related to the asset and ability to retain it for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; (iv) the condition and trend of the economic cycle; (v) historical and forecasted financial performance; and (vi) trends in the general market.\nWe review the carrying value of our property and equipment used in our operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. Fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital-asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry.\nWe test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs. For our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative analysis for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values. Any impairment charges incurred are not reversed if a subsequent evaluation concludes a higher valuation than the carrying value.\nFixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies\nWe define a fixed asset as a unit of property that (i) has an economic useful life that extends beyond 12 months and (ii) was acquired or produced for a cost greater than $2,500 for a single asset or greater than $5,000 for a group of assets. Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values. We acquired Bronco Billy's in May 2016, Silver Slipper in October 2012, Rising Star in April 2011 and Stockman's in January 2007. Project development costs, which are amounts expended on the pursuit of new business opportunities, and acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are also expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors and property taxes. Salaries are capitalized only for employees working directly on the project. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is sometimes a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur, which would change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nGoodwill and Business Combinations\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of net tangible and other intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We accounted for our acquisitions of casino properties for Bronco Billy's, Silver Slipper and Rising Star as business combinations. In a business combination, we determine the fair value of acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests, if any. The fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests based on their fair value, with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill. This allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets.\nIntangible Assets\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include the cost of gaming licenses and trade names. Gaming licenses represent the rights to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions, and trade names represent the fair value of the casino name's brand recognition. The value of our gaming licenses were primarily estimated using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The value of the Bronco Billy's trade names utilized the relief from royalty\u201d method, which primarily utilizes comparable royalty agreements to determine value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, unless it is determined that their useful life is no longer indefinite. We periodically review our indefinite-lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue\nto support an indefinite useful life. If it is determined that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has a finite useful life, then the asset is tested for impairment and is subsequently accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets include customer loyalty programs, land leases, payments for a lease option and water rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual or economic useful lives.\nCustomer loyalty programs represent the value of repeat business associated with the casinos' loyalty programs when we acquired the properties. Such values were determined using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The valuation analyses for the active-rated players were based on estimated revenues and attrition rates. Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel and Rising Star Casino Resort maintain historical information for the proportion of revenues attributable to the rated play, which acquisition costs were allocated to such customer loyalty programs. The combined value of the customer loyalty programs have since been fully-amortized over their assumed economic useful life, but remains a component of gross intangible assets other than goodwill, and comprises a majority of the related accumulated amortization. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies follow casino industry practices. Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with certain liabilities recognized, including progressive jackpots, earned customer loyalty incentives, funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs, and for certain chips and tokens in the customers' possession. Key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot coin-in and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage.\nRevenue for food and beverage, hotel, and other revenue transactions is typically the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services, plus the retail value of (i) discretionary comps and (ii) comps provided in return for redemption of loyalty points. We record such revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer. Additionally, we may collect deposits in advance for future hotel reservations or entertainment, among other services, which represent obligations to the Company until the service is provided to the customer. Sales and similar revenue-linked taxes (except for gaming taxes) collected from customers on behalf of, and submitted to, taxing authorities are also excluded from revenue and recorded as a current liability.\nCustomer Loyalty Programs\nWe have separate customer loyalty programs at each of our properties - Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, Bronco Billy's MVP Most Valuable Players\u201d Club, Rising Star Rewards Club\u2122, Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club\u00ae and the Stockman's Winner's Club. Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays, among others, depending on each property's specific offers. We also occasionally offer sweepstakes and other promotions for tracked customers that do not require redemption of points.\nAs points are accrued, we defer a portion of our gaming revenue based on the estimated standalone value of loyalty points being earned by the customer. The standalone value of loyalty points is derived from the retail value of food, beverages, hotel rooms, and other goods or services for which such points may be redeemed. A liability related to these customer loyalty points is recorded, net of estimated breakage and other factors, until the customer redeems these points, primarily for free casino play/cash back,\u201d complimentary dining, or hotel stays. Upon redemption, the related revenue is recognized at retail value within the department providing the goods or services. Unredeemed points are forfeited if the customer becomes and remains inactive for a specified period of time.\nLoyalty programs are a part of the total marketing program. The amount of marketing reinvestment (complimentaries to players, promotional awards, entertainment, etc.) is based on the specific property and competitive assumptions. We track the percentage of promotional and marketing costs, compared to gaming revenue, for an efficient use and return on our marketing investment. Our properties operate in highly-competitive promotional environments due to the high amounts of incentives offered by our competition.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of casino, hotel and other receivables, are typically non-interest bearing, and are carried net of an appropriate collection allowance to approximate fair value. The allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, as well as, historical collection experience and current economic and business\nconditions. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible, and recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions, including fundamental changes to the applicable tax laws.\nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not\u201d threshold. It is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nCommon Stock Warrant Liability\nWe measure the fair value of our common stock warrants at each reporting period based on Level 3 inputs as determined by GAAP. Due to the variable terms regarding the timing of the settlement of the warrants, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo\u201d simulation approach, a mathematical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes, to measure the fair value of the warrants. The simulation included certain estimates by Company management regarding the estimated timing of the settlement of the warrants. Significant increases or decreases in those management estimates would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value measurement of our warrant liability are measured quarterly, including changes caused by increases or decreases in our stock price, and are expensed or credited to income during the measurement period.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe have granted shares of common stock and stock options to key members of management and the board of directors. Accounting standards require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. Share-based compensation expense from stock awards is included in general and administrative expense. Vesting is contingent upon certain conditions, including continuous service of the individual recipients. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued. The Black-Scholes-determined fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. Full House Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, may be referred to as Full House,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d or us\u201d.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary business is the ownership and/or operation of casino and related hospitality and entertainment facilities, which includes offering casino gambling, hotel accommodations, dining, golfing, RV camping, sports betting, entertainment and retail outlets, among other amenities. We own or operate five casino properties in four states - Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana and Nevada. We view our Mississippi, Colorado and Indiana properties as distinct operating segments and both of our Nevada properties as one operating segment.\nOur portfolio consists of the following:\n\nOur financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. While we provide credit at some of our casinos where we are permitted to by gaming regulations, most of our revenues are cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our revenues are primarily derived from slot machines, but also include other gaming activities, along with table games, keno and sports betting. In addition, we derive a significant amount of revenue from our hotels and our food and beverage outlets. We also derive revenues from our golf course and ferry boat service at Rising Star, our RV parks as owned at Rising Star and managed at Silver Slipper, and retail outlets and entertainment.\nWe often provide hotel rooms and food and beverages to customers on a complimentary basis. Prior to 2018, the retail value of such services was included in the respective revenue classifications and then deducted as promotional allowances to calculate net revenues. With the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard discussed below, amounts historically included in the promotional allowances line have been eliminated as they are now included as a contra-revenue, primarily reducing our casino revenues. Hence, beginning in 2018, our hotel, food and beverage revenues reflect the retail value of such services, including such services provided on a complimentary basis, while our casino revenues are net of the retail value of services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of results in future periods.\nOur market environment is highly competitive and capital-intensive. We rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. We also assess growth and development opportunities, which include capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nBronco Billy's Expansion. In 2018, we began our expansion of Bronco Billy's, which we anticipate completing in two phases. Phase One of the Bronco Billy's expansion project includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building, the purchase of the Imperial Hotel (which we acquired in June 2018) and certain other nearby parcels of land, and the reopening and rebranding of the Imperial Casino and Hotel as the Christmas Casino & Inn (which occurred in November 2018). Phase Two of the Bronco Billy's expansion project, which is expected to include a new luxury hotel tower, spa, convention and entertainment space, and two new restaurants, is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nDebt Refinancing. In February 2018, we issued $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds were used to fund the repayment of our outstanding First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities, the associated refinancing costs, and to provide for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes.\nRacetrack Proposal. The New Mexico Racing Commission (the Commission\u201d) recently announced a competitive process regarding the issuance of the state's sixth racing license. In accordance with that process, we formally presented our racetrack casino proposal ( La Posada del Llano\u201d) to the Commission in October 2018 and answered additional questions regarding our project in November 2018. If selected by the Commission, La Posada del Llano is expected to include a racetrack featuring a unique Moving Grandstand,\u201d an 18-hole championship golf course, a casino with up to 750 slot machines, and a 300-guestroom hotel, among other amenities. Due to litigation filed against the Commission by one of the other applicants, it is uncertain when the Commission will make a decision regarding the issuance of the racetrack license.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use several key performance indicators to evaluate the operations of our properties. These key performance indicators include the following:\nGaming revenue indicators:\nSlot coin-in is the gross dollar amount wagered in slot machines and table game drop is the total amount of cash or credit exchanged into chips at table games for use by our customers. Slot coin-in and table game drop are indicators of volume.\nSlot win is the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines. Table game hold is the difference between the amount of money or markers exchanged into chips at the tables and customer winnings paid. Slot win and table game hold percentages represent the relationship between slot win and coin-in and table game win and drop.\nRoom revenue indicators:\nHotel occupancy rate is an indicator of the utilization of our available rooms. Complimentary room sales, or the retail value of accommodations furnished to customers free of charge, are included in the calculation of the hotel occupancy rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin:\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our performance. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA see Non-GAAP Measure.\u201d We utilize Adjusted Property EBITDA as the measure of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Additionally, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted Property EBITDA by the property's net revenues.\nResults of Operations - 2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated operating results\nThe following summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606 for Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d or Note 2,\u201d for more information regarding this new revenue recognition standard, as well as a summary of its effects on our revenues and expenses. We do not expect that this new revenue recognition standard will have an aggregate material impact on operating income, net income, or cash flows on an ongoing basis. However, due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly between years due to reclassifications between the various departments, in addition to other changes discussed in Note 2.\n\nThe following table details our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which are comprised of casino and non-casino operations. Non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 are shown below as net of promotional allowances. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect the new accounting standard, where the retail value of complimentary services is a reduction to casino revenues, while non-casino revenues reflect the retail value of both complimentary and non-complimentary services. The table shows that most of the differences between the periods in each of these categories is related to the implementation of ASC 606. See Note 2 for more information.\n\nThe following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, unless otherwise described. For further discussions, refer to Operating results - reportable segments\u201d below.\nRevenues. As indicated in the above table, net revenues increased 1.6%, despite the $0.9 million impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The accounting change had the greatest impact on net revenues for Grand Lodge Casino, a part of our Northern Nevada segment, as third-party payments for hotel guestrooms, food, and beverages are now classified as offsets to casino revenue; whereas in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under legacy revenue recognition standards. Rising Star was the least affected by ASC 606 during the year, but had declines in net revenues due to significant weather issues particularly in the first quarter, which reduced gaming volumes for the local casino market in southeastern Indiana as a whole.\nOur other properties achieved gains from improved marketing and a full year's worth of new amenities and other improvements, as well as significantly improved weather in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net revenues at Bronco Billy's increased due to the acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018 and Imperial Casino in August 2018 (collectively rebranded in November 2018 as the Christmas Casino & Inn), a full year of the Crippled Cow restaurant (which opened in mid-2017), and increased covers at other venues. At Silver Slipper, new marketing initiatives helped increase net revenues in both gaming and non-gaming operations, as did a full year of operations at the property's new Beach Club and Oyster Bar.\nOperating expenses. Expenses for individual departments varied significantly due to the new revenue recognition standard, which no longer requires us to reclassify the estimated cost of providing complimentaries to a gaming customer from other expense categories to casino expenses. See Note 2 for more details regarding the new revenue recognition standard, which impacted reporting for casino expenses by $(30.2) million, food and beverage expenses by $26.3 million, hotel expenses by $9.0 million, and other operations by $1.4 million. Additionally, operating expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes, through both additional guests and a full-year of additional amenities, as described in further detail in the segment section below. Marketing expenses also increased, primarily at Bronco Billy's due to improvements in the loyalty program.\nApart from the new revenue recognition standard, project development and acquisition costs increased by $0.6 million during 2018, reflecting our participation in the competitive process to develop a racetrack casino in New Mexico, our development efforts in Terre Haute, and elsewhere. Preopening costs increased by $0.3 million and were related to our new ferry boat operations at Rising Star and the Christmas Casino & Inn launch at Bronco Billy's.\nInterest and other non-operating expense, net.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in February 2018, which resulted in a lower effective interest rate than our prior credit facilities, and increased capitalization of interest expense during 2018 from our growth projects.\nOther non-operating expense, net\nDuring 2018, we incurred $1.0 million of other non-operating expense due primarily to the February 2018 refinancing of our prior credit facilities, which resulted in a $2.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt. This expense was partly offset by a $1.7 million gain from the non-cash fair value adjustment of our common stock warrant liability. The common stock warrant liability is adjusted to fair value each quarter. During 2017, other non-operating expense was $1.4 million, due to the fair value adjustments to our warrants. The decrease in fair value during 2018 primarily related to the decrease in our share price during that period.\nIncome taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was (12.2)% and 2.9%, respectively. Our tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the effects of changes in tax law, changes in valuation allowance, and items that are permanently treated differently for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and tax purposes. During 2018, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of any available deferred tax liabilities. In future years, if it is determined that we meet the more likely than not\u201d threshold of utilizing our deferred tax assets, we may reverse some or all of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted which, beginning in 2018, reduced the maximum corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. As of the date of enactment, we reduced our federal deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the new statutory rate, resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.9 million in 2017.\nAdditionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Tax Act currently available. This resulted in no additional SAB 118 tax benefit or cost for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe do not expect to pay any federal income taxes or receive any federal tax refunds related to our 2018 results of operations. Tax losses incurred in 2018 may shelter taxable income in future years, but because of the level of uncertainty regarding sufficient prospective taxable income, we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as mentioned above.\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, for a more detailed discussion.\nOperating results - reportable segments\nWe manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States. Accordingly, Stockman's and Grand Lodge Casino comprise our Northern Nevada business segment, while Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy's and Rising Star are currently distinct segments. With the addition of ferry boat operations in September 2018, our Rising Star segment now includes ferry boat operations between Indiana and Kentucky. In November 2018, we opened the Christmas Casino & Inn in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is included in the Bronco Billy's segment.\nThe following table presents detail by segment of our consolidated net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as its measure of segment profit. The comparability of the information for the periods presented was not materially affected by the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard.\n\nSilver Slipper Casino and Hotel\nNet revenues increased during 2018 due to successful marketing initiatives, the addition of sports book operations in August 2018, the ramp-up of new amenities that opened in mid-2017, and improved weather versus the prior year, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nUnder the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly due to reclassifications between the various departments, as well as other changes discussed in Note 2. Apart from this accounting change, slot revenues, which accounted for approximately 88% of our casino revenue, increased by 6.3%. Meanwhile, table games revenue increased by 5.8%.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues grew 7.4% during the year. Hotel occupancy was 91.7% compared to 88.3% in the prior year. In addition to the sports book operations mentioned above, 2018 also reflects a full year of new amenities at the property, including the Beach Club and the Oyster Bar, which both opened in mid-2017.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA increased by 13.0% to $12.1 million in 2018, primarily from the growth in net revenue described above. Of note, Adjusted Property EBITDA in September 2017 included settlement proceeds of $675,000 related to the conclusion of litigation for construction defects at our parking garage, of which there was no comparable non-recurring credit or charge in 2018. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 17.5% in 2018 compared to 16.8% in 2017.\nRising Star Casino Resort\nNet revenues decreased during 2018 due to adverse weather conditions, most notably during the first quarter from approximately 21 days of heavy snowfall, as well as two days when the casino was closed due to the flooding of nearby access roads. This affected guest volumes, as reflected in a 3.6% decrease of slot coin-in during the year.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues decreased by 2.7% and table games revenues decreased by 10.3% due to lower volumes, while promotional allowances decreased by 7.9%. Non-gaming net revenues decreased by 2.0% during 2018, in part reflecting a temporary reduction in the number of available room-nights due to hotel improvements during the year. Average daily room rate remained flat.\nThough our net revenues decreased compared to prior year, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased to $2.8 million from $2.7 million due to improved efficiencies driven by new management, a focus on cost controls, and savings from streamlining labor.\nDuring the second half of 2018, we completed certain maintenance and growth-related capital expenditure projects, which were designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation, revenue and income growth. In July 2018, we completed improvements made to the entry pavilion and the adjoining hotel's lobby and hallways. In September 2018, we completed the new access roads to the ferry landing sites and commenced implementation of a 10-vehicle ferry boat service to Kentucky as mentioned above, which significantly shortened the distance for customers traveling from the more populous Boone County, Kentucky to Rising Star. We invested a total of approximately $4.9 million with respect to the foregoing improvements at Rising Star in 2018.\nBronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\nHigher gaming volumes, new restaurant outlets, and the opening of the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn resulted in increases to both our casino revenues and non-gaming revenues in 2018, as discussed in more detail below.\nAbsent the accounting change noted above, slot revenues increased slightly by 0.3% due to higher volumes brought on by the opening of our Christmas Casino in November 2018. However, table games revenue decreased by 1.6% due to lower volumes.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues increased by 5.7% during 2018, reflecting a full year of revenue generated from the Crippled Cow outlet, which opened in mid-2017, as well as Rudy's Diner and an additional bar at the Christmas Casino, which opened in November 2018. Hotel revenues increased by 18.4% resulting from our acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, which increased the total number of hotel rooms at Bronco Billy's from 24 to 36 guestrooms. In November 2018, we rebranded the Imperial Hotel and reopened the Imperial Casino, together as the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA decreased by 17.6% due to rising operational costs. These costs included higher promotional expenses related to changes in the accruals for the property's loyalty marketing program. Operational costs were also affected by an increase in the state's minimum wage, as well as the additional labor needed for the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAs discussed in the Executive Overview\u201d and Liquidity & Capital Resources\u201d sections, progress continues on our planned expansion of Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel.\nNorthern Nevada\nOur Northern Nevada operations have historically been seasonal, with the summer months accounting for a disproportionate share of its annual revenues. Additionally, snowfall levels during the winter months also frequently have a positive or negative effect. Grand Lodge Casino is located near several ski resorts, including Alpine Meadows, Northstar and Squaw Valley. Normally, we benefit from a good\u201d snow year, resulting in extended periods of operation at the nearby ski areas.\nNet revenues decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. The impact is different here than at our other properties, as many of the complimentary services we provide to our customers are paid for by us, but are actually provided by our landlord, Hyatt. During 2018, promotional allowances provided by third-parties (principally Hyatt) were directly netted against casino revenues at Grand Lodge Casino, while in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under the prior revenue recognition standards. A similar reclassification was related to the use of hotel rooms at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe, which we provided to gaming customers on a complimentary basis.\nAt Stockman's Casino, construction at the nearby Navy base adversely affected business, as fewer air training groups were in town, which led to a decline in gaming volume.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues in our Northern Nevada division increased, with both slot coin-in and win increasing and slot hold percentage remaining relatively flat. Though table games revenue decreased slightly, our overall casino revenue increased during the year by 1.6%.\nRegarding non-gaming net revenues, which within the division are primarily at Stockman's, food and beverage revenue increased by 9.7%, reflecting the completion of construction at the property and improved products.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA in Northern Nevada increased by 21.0%, reflecting the completion of a significant renovation of Grand Lodge Casino in mid-2017, as well as exterior improvements, improved parking access at Stockman's Casino, and a focus on controlling costs. Additionally, an improved ski season at Grand Lodge Casino in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited results.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses increased slightly by 1.9% in 2018 due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, and salaries and benefits.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as supplemental disclosure to measures reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) because management believes this measure is (i) a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industries and (ii) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. In addition, a version of Adjusted EBITDA (known as Consolidated EBITDA) is utilized in the covenants within our indenture, although not necessarily defined in the same way as above. Adjusted EBITDA is not, however, a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, this measure should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flows as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nThe following tables present reconciliations of operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n\nOperating expenses deducted to arrive at operating income (loss) in the above tables include facility rents related to: (i) Silver Slipper of $1.6 million in 2018 and $1.5 million in 2017, (ii) Northern Nevada segment of $1.9 million in both 2018 and 2017, and (iii) Bronco Billy's of $0.4 million in 2018 and $0.3 million in 2017. Capital lease payments of $0.7 million during both 2018 and 2017 related to Rising Star's smaller hotel are not deducted, as such payments are accounted for as interest expense and amortization of debt related to the capitalized lease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $20.6 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents. Management currently estimates that approximately $10 million of cash and equivalents is currently required for our day-to-day operations.\nOur casinos are our primary sources of income and operating cash flows. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. Subject to the effects of the economic uncertainties discussed herein, we believe that adequate financial resources (including from operating cash flows and external debt and equity financing) will be available to fund ongoing operating requirements over the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurances of our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth efforts.\nCash flows - operating activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operations during 2018 was $9.8 million compared to $7.1 million in 2017. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but are also affected by changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, prepaid expenses, and payables. The increase in our operating cash flows during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the increase in our operating income and working capital timing differences.\nCash flows - investing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash used in investing activities during 2018 was $17.4 million, which primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including our new ferry boat service at Rising Star, the refurbishment and rebranding of the Christmas Casino & Inn, and development work for the Bronco Billy's expansion, as well as the purchase of the Imperial Hotel and other land adjacent to Bronco Billy's. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was $11.2 million and primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including the Silver Slipper Beach Club, the Oyster Bar at Silver Slipper, and the refurbishment of Grand Lodge Casino.\nCash flows - financing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was $8.3 million, which primarily related to the proceeds from the registered direct equity offering that we completed in March 2018 and offset by payments related to the refinancing of our credit facilities, loan and lease principal payments, and purchase of an interest rate cap. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was $3.1 million, primarily related to $2.2 million of First Lien Term Loan payments.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWe have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our interest requirements and maintain our properties. Our debt matures in February 2024 and we anticipate needing to refinance our debt prior to its maturity, as we are unlikely to generate sufficient cash flow in the interim and be debt-free by such date. Our planned capital expenditures designed to grow the Company will require additional financing, including perhaps, the issuance of additional debt and potentially some form of equity financing. Our operations are subject to financial, economic, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow and/or access the capital markets, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying, or eliminating certain planned capital expenditures, selling assets, obtaining additional equity financing, or borrowing at higher costs of capital.\nLong-Term Debt. At December 31, 2018, we had $99.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding from the original $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the Notes offering were used to pay off all of our outstanding First and Second Lien Credit Facilities, pay for costs associated with the refinancing, provide ongoing working capital, provide funds for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. We currently estimate, based on current LIBOR rates, that our cash interest expense in 2019 will be approximately $10 million, including the interest component of our capital lease. This estimate is based on our total outstanding debt and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months.\nInterest Rate Cap Agreement. In connection with the refinancing, we purchased an interest rate cap ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) for $238,000 on April 6, 2018. We entered into this interest rate derivative with Capital One, N.A. to minimize the effect of interest rate increases on approximately half of our outstanding borrowings with a notional amount of $50 million and strike rate of 3.00%, which resets every three months at the end of March, June, September, and December. The Interest Rate Cap expires on March 31, 2021 and is presented accordingly on our consolidated balance sheet under Deposits and other\u201d as a non-current asset. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCommon Stock Warrants. In 2016, we granted the lenders under the former Second Lien Credit Facility (the Second Lien Lenders\u201d) warrants representing rights to purchase approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at $1.67 per share, the average trading price of our common stock during a 60-day period bracketing the date of issuance. The warrants include redemption rights which allow the warrant-holders, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the warrants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The refinancing of the Second Lien Credit Facility in February 2018 qualified as a triggering event. As of the date of this filing, the Second Lien Lenders have not exercised these redemption rights, though they may do so on any six-month anniversary of the refinancing date prior to warrant expiration in May 2026. If they do exercise their redemption rights, we have the option of paying them in cash or with a four-year note on terms stipulated in the warrant agreement. Alternatively, the warrant-holders may choose to have us register and sell the shares related to the warrants through a public offering. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information associated with these warrants which could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nHyatt Option to Purchase our Leasehold Interest and Related Assets. Our lease with Hyatt to operate the Grand Lodge Casino contains an option for Hyatt, as of January 1, 2019, to purchase our leasehold interest and related casino operating assets. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information about this option and related rental commitments that could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nCapital Investments. We have made significant investments through 2018 and expect to make additional capital investments during 2019 and beyond. These investments are designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation at our properties, revenue and income growth.\nBronco Billy's - As discussed above in the Executive Overview,\u201d we began Phase One of the two-phase expansion of our Bronco Billy's property with our purchase of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, along with other nearby parcels of land, and our lease of the Imperial Casino in August 2018. In November 2018, we reopened the Imperial Hotel and Casino as the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn. The remainder of Phase One includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building. We estimate that the total cost for Phase One of the expansion is approximately $20 million, which is expected to be funded from cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations. We have invested approximately $5 million in total for Phase One, and expect to invest the balance of $15 million in 2019. We expect to commence construction of the parking garage in the first half of 2019 and to complete such construction by the end of 2019. For Phase Two, we continue to discuss amenities, fixtures, and other related topics with our architects and general contractor in our efforts to execute a guaranteed maximum price contract and finalize an overall budget for the project. We currently expect to begin Phase Two upon the conclusion of Phase One, with completion of the entire expansion project expected in 2021. However, construction of Phase Two is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nSilver Slipper - We are planning to remodel the Silver Slipper casino in the second quarter of 2019, which will be the property's first significant renovation since it opened in 2006. We do not expect renovations to disrupt operations, as our upgrades to the carpeting, wallpaper, and seating within the buffet will occur during periods of low guest traffic. The estimated cost of this renovation is less than $1 million.\nOther Capital Expenditures - Additionally, we may fund various other capital expenditure projects, depending on our financial resources. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate due to decisions regarding strategic capital investments in new or existing facilities, and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. No assurance can be given that any of our planned capital expenditure projects will be completed or that any completed projects will be successful. Our annual capital expenditures typically include some number of new slot machines and related equipment; to some extent, we can coordinate such purchases to match our resources.\nWe evaluate projects based on a number of factors, including profitability forecasts, length of the development period, the regulatory and political environment, and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development or acquisition, among other considerations. No assurance can be given that any additional projects will be pursued or completed or that any completed projects will be successful.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements\nSenior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn February 2, 2018, we refinanced amounts previously outstanding of $41 million under the First Lien Credit Facility and $55 million under the Second Lien Credit Facility with $100 million of Notes, which we sold to qualified institutional buyers. The Notes are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries.\nThe Notes bear interest at the greater of the three-month LIBOR or 1.0%, plus a margin rate of 7.0%. The indenture governing the Notes provides for a 50 basis point interest premium if Mr. Lee reduces his equity interests by 50% or more while serving as our CEO. Mr. Lee has no current intention to sell any shares. During the fourth quarter, he purchased 15,000 shares on the open market. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year until the Notes mature in February 2024. On each interest payment date, we are required to make principal payments of $250,000 with a balloon payment for the remaining $94 million due upon maturity.\nMandatory prepayments of the Notes will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price may be prepaid at 102% of par through February 1, 2020; 101.5% through February 1, 2021; 100.5% through February 1, 2022; and 100% thereafter.\nCovenants\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As defined in the indenture, we are required to maintain a total leverage ratio, which measures Consolidated EBITDA\u201d against outstanding net debt. Additionally, we are allowed to deduct up to $15 million of our cash and equivalents (beyond estimated cash utilized in daily operations) in calculating the numerator of such ratio. For the upcoming year, the total leverage covenant ratio requirements are 5.00x through June 30, 2019 and 4.75x through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our covenants; however, there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with all covenants in the future. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our Notes due 2024.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore, actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nOur long-lived assets include property and equipment, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangibles, and are evaluated at least annually (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances that might indicate impairment testing is warranted might include, as applicable, an adverse change in the legal, regulatory or business climate relative to gaming nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or a significant long-term decline in historical or forecasted earnings or cash flows or the fair value of our property or business, possibly as a result of competitive or other economic or political factors. In evaluating whether a loss in value is other than temporary, we consider: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value or market value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the casino property, including any specific events which may influence the operations; (iii) our intent related to the asset and ability to retain it for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; (iv) the condition and trend of the economic cycle; (v) historical and forecasted financial performance; and (vi) trends in the general market.\nWe review the carrying value of our property and equipment used in our operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. Fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital-asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry.\nWe test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs. For our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative analysis for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values. Any impairment charges incurred are not reversed if a subsequent evaluation concludes a higher valuation than the carrying value.\nFixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies\nWe define a fixed asset as a unit of property that (i) has an economic useful life that extends beyond 12 months and (ii) was acquired or produced for a cost greater than $2,500 for a single asset or greater than $5,000 for a group of assets. Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values. We acquired Bronco Billy's in May 2016, Silver Slipper in October 2012, Rising Star in April 2011 and Stockman's in January 2007. Project development costs, which are amounts expended on the pursuit of new business opportunities, and acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are also expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors and property taxes. Salaries are capitalized only for employees working directly on the project. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is sometimes a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur, which would change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nGoodwill and Business Combinations\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of net tangible and other intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We accounted for our acquisitions of casino properties for Bronco Billy's, Silver Slipper and Rising Star as business combinations. In a business combination, we determine the fair value of acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests, if any. The fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests based on their fair value, with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill. This allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets.\nIntangible Assets\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include the cost of gaming licenses and trade names. Gaming licenses represent the rights to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions, and trade names represent the fair value of the casino name's brand recognition. The value of our gaming licenses were primarily estimated using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The value of the Bronco Billy's trade names utilized the relief from royalty\u201d method, which primarily utilizes comparable royalty agreements to determine value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, unless it is determined that their useful life is no longer indefinite. We periodically review our indefinite-lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue\nto support an indefinite useful life. If it is determined that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has a finite useful life, then the asset is tested for impairment and is subsequently accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets include customer loyalty programs, land leases, payments for a lease option and water rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual or economic useful lives.\nCustomer loyalty programs represent the value of repeat business associated with the casinos' loyalty programs when we acquired the properties. Such values were determined using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The valuation analyses for the active-rated players were based on estimated revenues and attrition rates. Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel and Rising Star Casino Resort maintain historical information for the proportion of revenues attributable to the rated play, which acquisition costs were allocated to such customer loyalty programs. The combined value of the customer loyalty programs have since been fully-amortized over their assumed economic useful life, but remains a component of gross intangible assets other than goodwill, and comprises a majority of the related accumulated amortization. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies follow casino industry practices. Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with certain liabilities recognized, including progressive jackpots, earned customer loyalty incentives, funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs, and for certain chips and tokens in the customers' possession. Key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot coin-in and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage.\nRevenue for food and beverage, hotel, and other revenue transactions is typically the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services, plus the retail value of (i) discretionary comps and (ii) comps provided in return for redemption of loyalty points. We record such revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer. Additionally, we may collect deposits in advance for future hotel reservations or entertainment, among other services, which represent obligations to the Company until the service is provided to the customer. Sales and similar revenue-linked taxes (except for gaming taxes) collected from customers on behalf of, and submitted to, taxing authorities are also excluded from revenue and recorded as a current liability.\nCustomer Loyalty Programs\nWe have separate customer loyalty programs at each of our properties - Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, Bronco Billy's MVP Most Valuable Players\u201d Club, Rising Star Rewards Club\u2122, Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club\u00ae and the Stockman's Winner's Club. Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays, among others, depending on each property's specific offers. We also occasionally offer sweepstakes and other promotions for tracked customers that do not require redemption of points.\nAs points are accrued, we defer a portion of our gaming revenue based on the estimated standalone value of loyalty points being earned by the customer. The standalone value of loyalty points is derived from the retail value of food, beverages, hotel rooms, and other goods or services for which such points may be redeemed. A liability related to these customer loyalty points is recorded, net of estimated breakage and other factors, until the customer redeems these points, primarily for free casino play/cash back,\u201d complimentary dining, or hotel stays. Upon redemption, the related revenue is recognized at retail value within the department providing the goods or services. Unredeemed points are forfeited if the customer becomes and remains inactive for a specified period of time.\nLoyalty programs are a part of the total marketing program. The amount of marketing reinvestment (complimentaries to players, promotional awards, entertainment, etc.) is based on the specific property and competitive assumptions. We track the percentage of promotional and marketing costs, compared to gaming revenue, for an efficient use and return on our marketing investment. Our properties operate in highly-competitive promotional environments due to the high amounts of incentives offered by our competition.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of casino, hotel and other receivables, are typically non-interest bearing, and are carried net of an appropriate collection allowance to approximate fair value. The allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, as well as, historical collection experience and current economic and business\nconditions. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible, and recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions, including fundamental changes to the applicable tax laws.\nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not\u201d threshold. It is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nCommon Stock Warrant Liability\nWe measure the fair value of our common stock warrants at each reporting period based on Level 3 inputs as determined by GAAP. Due to the variable terms regarding the timing of the settlement of the warrants, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo\u201d simulation approach, a mathematical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes, to measure the fair value of the warrants. The simulation included certain estimates by Company management regarding the estimated timing of the settlement of the warrants. Significant increases or decreases in those management estimates would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value measurement of our warrant liability are measured quarterly, including changes caused by increases or decreases in our stock price, and are expensed or credited to income during the measurement period.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe have granted shares of common stock and stock options to key members of management and the board of directors. Accounting standards require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. Share-based compensation expense from stock awards is included in general and administrative expense. Vesting is contingent upon certain conditions, including continuous service of the individual recipients. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued. The Black-Scholes-determined fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period.\nRecently Issued Accounting", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. Full House Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, may be referred to as Full House,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d or us\u201d.\nExecutive Overview\nOur primary business is the ownership and/or operation of casino and related hospitality and entertainment facilities, which includes offering casino gambling, hotel accommodations, dining, golfing, RV camping, sports betting, entertainment and retail outlets, among other amenities. We own or operate five casino properties in four states - Mississippi, Colorado, Indiana and Nevada. We view our Mississippi, Colorado and Indiana properties as distinct operating segments and both of our Nevada properties as one operating segment.\nOur portfolio consists of the following:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Hancock County, MS\n(near New Orleans)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cripple Creek, CO\n(near Colorado Springs)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rising Sun, IN\n(near Cincinnati)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockman's Casino\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fallon, NV\n(one hour east of Reno)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Grand Lodge Casino (leased and part of the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incline Village, NV\n(North Shore of Lake Tahoe)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. While we provide credit at some of our casinos where we are permitted to by gaming regulations, most of our revenues are cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our revenues are primarily derived from slot machines, but also include other gaming activities, along with table games, keno and sports betting. In addition, we derive a significant amount of revenue from our hotels and our food and beverage outlets. We also derive revenues from our golf course and ferry boat service at Rising Star, our RV parks as owned at Rising Star and managed at Silver Slipper, and retail outlets and entertainment.\nWe often provide hotel rooms and food and beverages to customers on a complimentary basis. Prior to 2018, the retail value of such services was included in the respective revenue classifications and then deducted as promotional allowances to calculate net revenues. With the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard discussed below, amounts historically included in the promotional allowances line have been eliminated as they are now included as a contra-revenue, primarily reducing our casino revenues. Hence, beginning in 2018, our hotel, food and beverage revenues reflect the retail value of such services, including such services provided on a complimentary basis, while our casino revenues are net of the retail value of services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of results in future periods.\nOur market environment is highly competitive and capital-intensive. We rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. We also assess growth and development opportunities, which include capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties.\nRecent Developments\nBronco Billy's Expansion. In 2018, we began our expansion of Bronco Billy's, which we anticipate completing in two phases. Phase One of the Bronco Billy's expansion project includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building, the purchase of the Imperial Hotel (which we acquired in June 2018) and certain other nearby parcels of land, and the reopening and rebranding of the Imperial Casino and Hotel as the Christmas Casino & Inn (which occurred in November 2018). Phase Two of the Bronco Billy's expansion project, which is expected to include a new luxury hotel tower, spa, convention and entertainment space, and two new restaurants, is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nDebt Refinancing. In February 2018, we issued $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds were used to fund the repayment of our outstanding First Lien and Second Lien Credit Facilities, the associated refinancing costs, and to provide for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes.\nRacetrack Proposal. The New Mexico Racing Commission (the Commission\u201d) recently announced a competitive process regarding the issuance of the state's sixth racing license. In accordance with that process, we formally presented our racetrack casino proposal ( La Posada del Llano\u201d) to the Commission in October 2018 and answered additional questions regarding our project in November 2018. If selected by the Commission, La Posada del Llano is expected to include a racetrack featuring a unique Moving Grandstand,\u201d an 18-hole championship golf course, a casino with up to 750 slot machines, and a 300-guestroom hotel, among other amenities. Due to litigation filed against the Commission by one of the other applicants, it is uncertain when the Commission will make a decision regarding the issuance of the racetrack license.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use several key performance indicators to evaluate the operations of our properties. These key performance indicators include the following:\nGaming revenue indicators:\nSlot coin-in is the gross dollar amount wagered in slot machines and table game drop is the total amount of cash or credit exchanged into chips at table games for use by our customers. Slot coin-in and table game drop are indicators of volume.\nSlot win is the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines. Table game hold is the difference between the amount of money or markers exchanged into chips at the tables and customer winnings paid. Slot win and table game hold percentages represent the relationship between slot win and coin-in and table game win and drop.\nRoom revenue indicators:\nHotel occupancy rate is an indicator of the utilization of our available rooms. Complimentary room sales, or the retail value of accommodations furnished to customers free of charge, are included in the calculation of the hotel occupancy rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin:\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our performance. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA see Non-GAAP Measure.\u201d We utilize Adjusted Property EBITDA as the measure of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Additionally, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA Margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted Property EBITDA by the property's net revenues.\nResults of Operations - 2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated operating results\nThe following summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification 606 for Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d) on January 1, 2018. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d or Note 2,\u201d for more information regarding this new revenue recognition standard, as well as a summary of its effects on our revenues and expenses. We do not expect that this new revenue recognition standard will have an aggregate material impact on operating income, net income, or cash flows on an ongoing basis. However, due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly between years due to reclassifications between the various departments, in addition to other changes discussed in Note 2.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Difference\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>156,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>7,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other non-operating expenses, net\n</td> <td>11,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(417.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,371\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which are comprised of casino and non-casino operations. Non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 are shown below as net of promotional allowances. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect the new accounting standard, where the retail value of complimentary services is a reduction to casino revenues, while non-casino revenues reflect the retail value of both complimentary and non-complimentary services. The table shows that most of the differences between the periods in each of these categories is related to the implementation of ASC 606. See Note 2 for more information.\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Difference\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ASC 606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casino revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Slots\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,351\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table games\n</td> <td>18,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>114,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-casino revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and beverage\n</td> <td>35,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel\n</td> <td>9,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>49,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(892\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, unless otherwise described. For further discussions, refer to Operating results - reportable segments\u201d below.\nRevenues. As indicated in the above table, net revenues increased 1.6%, despite the $0.9 million impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The accounting change had the greatest impact on net revenues for Grand Lodge Casino, a part of our Northern Nevada segment, as third-party payments for hotel guestrooms, food, and beverages are now classified as offsets to casino revenue; whereas in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under legacy revenue recognition standards. Rising Star was the least affected by ASC 606 during the year, but had declines in net revenues due to significant weather issues particularly in the first quarter, which reduced gaming volumes for the local casino market in southeastern Indiana as a whole.\nOur other properties achieved gains from improved marketing and a full year's worth of new amenities and other improvements, as well as significantly improved weather in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net revenues at Bronco Billy's increased due to the acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018 and Imperial Casino in August 2018 (collectively rebranded in November 2018 as the Christmas Casino & Inn), a full year of the Crippled Cow restaurant (which opened in mid-2017), and increased covers at other venues. At Silver Slipper, new marketing initiatives helped increase net revenues in both gaming and non-gaming operations, as did a full year of operations at the property's new Beach Club and Oyster Bar.\nOperating expenses. Expenses for individual departments varied significantly due to the new revenue recognition standard, which no longer requires us to reclassify the estimated cost of providing complimentaries to a gaming customer from other expense categories to casino expenses. See Note 2 for more details regarding the new revenue recognition standard, which impacted reporting for casino expenses by $(30.2) million, food and beverage expenses by $26.3 million, hotel expenses by $9.0 million, and other operations by $1.4 million. Additionally, operating expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes, through both additional guests and a full-year of additional amenities, as described in further detail in the segment section below. Marketing expenses also increased, primarily at Bronco Billy's due to improvements in the loyalty program.\nApart from the new revenue recognition standard, project development and acquisition costs increased by $0.6 million during 2018, reflecting our participation in the competitive process to develop a racetrack casino in New Mexico, our development efforts in Terre Haute, and elsewhere. Preopening costs increased by $0.3 million and were related to our new ferry boat operations at Rising Star and the Christmas Casino & Inn launch at Bronco Billy's.\nInterest and other non-operating expense, net.\nInterest Expense\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest cost (excluding loan fee amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of debt issuance costs and discount\n</td> <td>790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of interest rate cap agreement\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>(346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in February 2018, which resulted in a lower effective interest rate than our prior credit facilities, and increased capitalization of interest expense during 2018 from our growth projects.\nOther non-operating expense, net\nDuring 2018, we incurred $1.0 million of other non-operating expense due primarily to the February 2018 refinancing of our prior credit facilities, which resulted in a $2.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt. This expense was partly offset by a $1.7 million gain from the non-cash fair value adjustment of our common stock warrant liability. The common stock warrant liability is adjusted to fair value each quarter. During 2017, other non-operating expense was $1.4 million, due to the fair value adjustments to our warrants. The decrease in fair value during 2018 primarily related to the decrease in our share price during that period.\nIncome taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was (12.2)% and 2.9%, respectively. Our tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the effects of changes in tax law, changes in valuation allowance, and items that are permanently treated differently for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and tax purposes. During 2018, we continued to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of any available deferred tax liabilities. In future years, if it is determined that we meet the more likely than not\u201d threshold of utilizing our deferred tax assets, we may reverse some or all of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted which, beginning in 2018, reduced the maximum corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. As of the date of enactment, we reduced our federal deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance for the new statutory rate, resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.9 million in 2017.\nAdditionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Tax Act currently available. This resulted in no additional SAB 118 tax benefit or cost for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe do not expect to pay any federal income taxes or receive any federal tax refunds related to our 2018 results of operations. Tax losses incurred in 2018 may shelter taxable income in future years, but because of the level of uncertainty regarding sufficient prospective taxable income, we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, as mentioned above.\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, for a more detailed discussion.\nOperating results - reportable segments\nWe manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States. Accordingly, Stockman's and Grand Lodge Casino comprise our Northern Nevada business segment, while Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy's and Rising Star are currently distinct segments. With the addition of ferry boat operations in September 2018, our Rising Star segment now includes ferry boat operations between Indiana and Kentucky. In November 2018, we opened the Christmas Casino & Inn in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is included in the Bronco Billy's segment.\nThe following table presents detail by segment of our consolidated net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as its measure of segment profit. The comparability of the information for the periods presented was not materially affected by the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>47,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>26,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Nevada Casinos\n</td> <td>19,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Property EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rising Star Casino Resort\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\n</td> <td>3,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Nevada Casinos\n</td> <td>3,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Property EBITDA\n</td> <td>22,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(4,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSilver Slipper Casino and Hotel\nNet revenues increased during 2018 due to successful marketing initiatives, the addition of sports book operations in August 2018, the ramp-up of new amenities that opened in mid-2017, and improved weather versus the prior year, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nUnder the new revenue recognition standard, departmental revenues and expenses varied significantly due to reclassifications between the various departments, as well as other changes discussed in Note 2. Apart from this accounting change, slot revenues, which accounted for approximately 88% of our casino revenue, increased by 6.3%. Meanwhile, table games revenue increased by 5.8%.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues grew 7.4% during the year. Hotel occupancy was 91.7% compared to 88.3% in the prior year. In addition to the sports book operations mentioned above, 2018 also reflects a full year of new amenities at the property, including the Beach Club and the Oyster Bar, which both opened in mid-2017.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA increased by 13.0% to $12.1 million in 2018, primarily from the growth in net revenue described above. Of note, Adjusted Property EBITDA in September 2017 included settlement proceeds of $675,000 related to the conclusion of litigation for construction defects at our parking garage, of which there was no comparable non-recurring credit or charge in 2018. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 17.5% in 2018 compared to 16.8% in 2017.\nRising Star Casino Resort\nNet revenues decreased during 2018 due to adverse weather conditions, most notably during the first quarter from approximately 21 days of heavy snowfall, as well as two days when the casino was closed due to the flooding of nearby access roads. This affected guest volumes, as reflected in a 3.6% decrease of slot coin-in during the year.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues decreased by 2.7% and table games revenues decreased by 10.3% due to lower volumes, while promotional allowances decreased by 7.9%. Non-gaming net revenues decreased by 2.0% during 2018, in part reflecting a temporary reduction in the number of available room-nights due to hotel improvements during the year. Average daily room rate remained flat.\nThough our net revenues decreased compared to prior year, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased to $2.8 million from $2.7 million due to improved efficiencies driven by new management, a focus on cost controls, and savings from streamlining labor.\nDuring the second half of 2018, we completed certain maintenance and growth-related capital expenditure projects, which were designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation, revenue and income growth. In July 2018, we completed improvements made to the entry pavilion and the adjoining hotel's lobby and hallways. In September 2018, we completed the new access roads to the ferry landing sites and commenced implementation of a 10-vehicle ferry boat service to Kentucky as mentioned above, which significantly shortened the distance for customers traveling from the more populous Boone County, Kentucky to Rising Star. We invested a total of approximately $4.9 million with respect to the foregoing improvements at Rising Star in 2018.\nBronco Billy's Casino and Hotel\nHigher gaming volumes, new restaurant outlets, and the opening of the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn resulted in increases to both our casino revenues and non-gaming revenues in 2018, as discussed in more detail below.\nAbsent the accounting change noted above, slot revenues increased slightly by 0.3% due to higher volumes brought on by the opening of our Christmas Casino in November 2018. However, table games revenue decreased by 1.6% due to lower volumes.\nApart from the accounting change, food and beverage revenues increased by 5.7% during 2018, reflecting a full year of revenue generated from the Crippled Cow outlet, which opened in mid-2017, as well as Rudy's Diner and an additional bar at the Christmas Casino, which opened in November 2018. Hotel revenues increased by 18.4% resulting from our acquisition of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, which increased the total number of hotel rooms at Bronco Billy's from 24 to 36 guestrooms. In November 2018, we rebranded the Imperial Hotel and reopened the Imperial Casino, together as the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA decreased by 17.6% due to rising operational costs. These costs included higher promotional expenses related to changes in the accruals for the property's loyalty marketing program. Operational costs were also affected by an increase in the state's minimum wage, as well as the additional labor needed for the Christmas Casino & Inn.\nAs discussed in the Executive Overview\u201d and Liquidity & Capital Resources\u201d sections, progress continues on our planned expansion of Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel.\nNorthern Nevada\nOur Northern Nevada operations have historically been seasonal, with the summer months accounting for a disproportionate share of its annual revenues. Additionally, snowfall levels during the winter months also frequently have a positive or negative effect. Grand Lodge Casino is located near several ski resorts, including Alpine Meadows, Northstar and Squaw Valley. Normally, we benefit from a good\u201d snow year, resulting in extended periods of operation at the nearby ski areas.\nNet revenues decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. The impact is different here than at our other properties, as many of the complimentary services we provide to our customers are paid for by us, but are actually provided by our landlord, Hyatt. During 2018, promotional allowances provided by third-parties (principally Hyatt) were directly netted against casino revenues at Grand Lodge Casino, while in 2017, they were charged to operating expenses under the prior revenue recognition standards. A similar reclassification was related to the use of hotel rooms at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe, which we provided to gaming customers on a complimentary basis.\nAt Stockman's Casino, construction at the nearby Navy base adversely affected business, as fewer air training groups were in town, which led to a decline in gaming volume.\nAbsent the accounting change, slot revenues in our Northern Nevada division increased, with both slot coin-in and win increasing and slot hold percentage remaining relatively flat. Though table games revenue decreased slightly, our overall casino revenue increased during the year by 1.6%.\nRegarding non-gaming net revenues, which within the division are primarily at Stockman's, food and beverage revenue increased by 9.7%, reflecting the completion of construction at the property and improved products.\nAdjusted Property EBITDA in Northern Nevada increased by 21.0%, reflecting the completion of a significant renovation of Grand Lodge Casino in mid-2017, as well as exterior improvements, improved parking access at Stockman's Casino, and a focus on controlling costs. Additionally, an improved ski season at Grand Lodge Casino in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited results.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses increased slightly by 1.9% in 2018 due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, and salaries and benefits.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, impairment charges, asset write-offs, recoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, project development and acquisition costs, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as supplemental disclosure to measures reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) because management believes this measure is (i) a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming and hospitality industries and (ii) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. In addition, a version of Adjusted EBITDA (known as Consolidated EBITDA) is utilized in the covenants within our indenture, although not necessarily defined in the same way as above. Adjusted EBITDA is not, however, a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, this measure should be considered supplemental and not a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flows as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity.\nThe following

rents related to: (i) Silver Slipper of $1.6 million in 2018 and $1.5 million in 2017, (ii) Northern Nevada segment of $1.9 million in both 2018 and 2017, and (iii) Bronco Billy's of $0.4 million in 2018 and $0.3 million in 2017. Capital lease payments of $0.7 million during both 2018 and 2017 related to Rising Star's smaller hotel are not deducted, as such payments are accounted for as interest expense and amortization of debt related to the capitalized lease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $20.6 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents. Management currently estimates that approximately $10 million of cash and equivalents is currently required for our day-to-day operations.\nOur casinos are our primary sources of income and operating cash flows. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. Subject to the effects of the economic uncertainties discussed herein, we believe that adequate financial resources (including from operating cash flows and external debt and equity financing) will be available to fund ongoing operating requirements over the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurances of our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth efforts.\nCash flows - operating activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operations during 2018 was $9.8 million compared to $7.1 million in 2017. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but are also affected by changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, prepaid expenses, and payables. The increase in our operating cash flows during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the increase in our operating income and working capital timing differences.\nCash flows - investing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash used in investing activities during 2018 was $17.4 million, which primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including our new ferry boat service at Rising Star, the refurbishment and rebranding of the Christmas Casino & Inn, and development work for the Bronco Billy's expansion, as well as the purchase of the Imperial Hotel and other land adjacent to Bronco Billy's. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was $11.2 million and primarily related to several growth projects at our existing properties, including the Silver Slipper Beach Club, the Oyster Bar at Silver Slipper, and the refurbishment of Grand Lodge Casino.\nCash flows - financing activities. On a consolidated basis, cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was $8.3 million, which primarily related to the proceeds from the registered direct equity offering that we completed in March 2018 and offset by payments related to the refinancing of our credit facilities, loan and lease principal payments, and purchase of an interest rate cap. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was $3.1 million, primarily related to $2.2 million of First Lien Term Loan payments.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWe have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our interest requirements and maintain our properties. Our debt matures in February 2024 and we anticipate needing to refinance our debt prior to its maturity, as we are unlikely to generate sufficient cash flow in the interim and be debt-free by such date. Our planned capital expenditures designed to grow the Company will require additional financing, including perhaps, the issuance of additional debt and potentially some form of equity financing. Our operations are subject to financial, economic, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow and/or access the capital markets, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying, or eliminating certain planned capital expenditures, selling assets, obtaining additional equity financing, or borrowing at higher costs of capital.\nLong-Term Debt. At December 31, 2018, we had $99.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding from the original $100 million of new senior secured notes due 2024 (the Notes\u201d). The proceeds from the Notes offering were used to pay off all of our outstanding First and Second Lien Credit Facilities, pay for costs associated with the refinancing, provide ongoing working capital, provide funds for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. We currently estimate, based on current LIBOR rates, that our cash interest expense in 2019 will be approximately $10 million, including the interest component of our capital lease. This estimate is based on our total outstanding debt and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months.\nInterest Rate Cap Agreement. In connection with the refinancing, we purchased an interest rate cap ( Interest Rate Cap\u201d) for $238,000 on April 6, 2018. We entered into this interest rate derivative with Capital One, N.A. to minimize the effect of interest rate increases on approximately half of our outstanding borrowings with a notional amount of $50 million and strike rate of 3.00%, which resets every three months at the end of March, June, September, and December. The Interest Rate Cap expires on March 31, 2021 and is presented accordingly on our consolidated balance sheet under Deposits and other\u201d as a non-current asset. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCommon Stock Warrants. In 2016, we granted the lenders under the former Second Lien Credit Facility (the Second Lien Lenders\u201d) warrants representing rights to purchase approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at $1.67 per share, the average trading price of our common stock during a 60-day period bracketing the date of issuance. The warrants include redemption rights which allow the warrant-holders, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the warrants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The refinancing of the Second Lien Credit Facility in February 2018 qualified as a triggering event. As of the date of this filing, the Second Lien Lenders have not exercised these redemption rights, though they may do so on any six-month anniversary of the refinancing date prior to warrant expiration in May 2026. If they do exercise their redemption rights, we have the option of paying them in cash or with a four-year note on terms stipulated in the warrant agreement. Alternatively, the warrant-holders may choose to have us register and sell the shares related to the warrants through a public offering. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information associated with these warrants which could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nHyatt Option to Purchase our Leasehold Interest and Related Assets. Our lease with Hyatt to operate the Grand Lodge Casino contains an option for Hyatt, as of January 1, 2019, to purchase our leasehold interest and related casino operating assets. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information about this option and related rental commitments that could affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nCapital Investments. We have made significant investments through 2018 and expect to make additional capital investments during 2019 and beyond. These investments are designed to improve the guest experience and to drive visitation at our properties, revenue and income growth.\nBronco Billy's - As discussed above in the Executive Overview,\u201d we began Phase One of the two-phase expansion of our Bronco Billy's property with our purchase of the Imperial Hotel in June 2018, along with other nearby parcels of land, and our lease of the Imperial Casino in August 2018. In November 2018, we reopened the Imperial Hotel and Casino as the rebranded Christmas Casino & Inn. The remainder of Phase One includes the construction of a 319-space parking garage and connector building. We estimate that the total cost for Phase One of the expansion is approximately $20 million, which is expected to be funded from cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations. We have invested approximately $5 million in total for Phase One, and expect to invest the balance of $15 million in 2019. We expect to commence construction of the parking garage in the first half of 2019 and to complete such construction by the end of 2019. For Phase Two, we continue to discuss amenities, fixtures, and other related topics with our architects and general contractor in our efforts to execute a guaranteed maximum price contract and finalize an overall budget for the project. We currently expect to begin Phase Two upon the conclusion of Phase One, with completion of the entire expansion project expected in 2021. However, construction of Phase Two is contingent upon receipt of financing on acceptable terms, among other contingencies.\nSilver Slipper - We are planning to remodel the Silver Slipper casino in the second quarter of 2019, which will be the property's first significant renovation since it opened in 2006. We do not expect renovations to disrupt operations, as our upgrades to the carpeting, wallpaper, and seating within the buffet will occur during periods of low guest traffic. The estimated cost of this renovation is less than $1 million.\nOther Capital Expenditures - Additionally, we may fund various other capital expenditure projects, depending on our financial resources. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate due to decisions regarding strategic capital investments in new or existing facilities, and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. No assurance can be given that any of our planned capital expenditure projects will be completed or that any completed projects will be successful. Our annual capital expenditures typically include some number of new slot machines and related equipment; to some extent, we can coordinate such purchases to match our resources.\nWe evaluate projects based on a number of factors, including profitability forecasts, length of the development period, the regulatory and political environment, and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development or acquisition, among other considerations. No assurance can be given that any additional projects will be pursued or completed or that any completed projects will be successful.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements\nSenior Secured Notes due 2024\nOn February 2, 2018, we refinanced amounts previously outstanding of $41 million under the First Lien Credit Facility and $55 million under the Second Lien Credit Facility with $100 million of Notes, which we sold to qualified institutional buyers. The Notes are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries.\nThe Notes bear interest at the greater of the three-month LIBOR or 1.0%, plus a margin rate of 7.0%. The indenture governing the Notes provides for a 50 basis point interest premium if Mr. Lee reduces his equity interests by 50% or more while serving as our CEO. Mr. Lee has no current intention to sell any shares. During the fourth quarter, he purchased 15,000 shares on the open market. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year until the Notes mature in February 2024. On each interest payment date, we are required to make principal payments of $250,000 with a balloon payment for the remaining $94 million due upon maturity.\nMandatory prepayments of the Notes will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price may be prepaid at 102% of par through February 1, 2020; 101.5% through February 1, 2021; 100.5% through February 1, 2022; and 100% thereafter.\nCovenants\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As defined in the indenture, we are required to maintain a total leverage ratio, which measures Consolidated EBITDA\u201d against outstanding net debt. Additionally, we are allowed to deduct up to $15 million of our cash and equivalents (beyond estimated cash utilized in daily operations) in calculating the numerator of such ratio. For the upcoming year, the total leverage covenant ratio requirements are 5.00x through June 30, 2019 and 4.75x through December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our covenants; however, there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with all covenants in the future. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information about our Notes due 2024.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore, actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nOur long-lived assets include property and equipment, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangibles, and are evaluated at least annually (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances that might indicate impairment testing is warranted might include, as applicable, an adverse change in the legal, regulatory or business climate relative to gaming nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or a significant long-term decline in historical or forecasted earnings or cash flows or the fair value of our property or business, possibly as a result of competitive or other economic or political factors. In evaluating whether a loss in value is other than temporary, we consider: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value or market value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the casino property, including any specific events which may influence the operations; (iii) our intent related to the asset and ability to retain it for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; (iv) the condition and trend of the economic cycle; (v) historical and forecasted financial performance; and (vi) trends in the general market.\nWe review the carrying value of our property and equipment used in our operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. Fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital-asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry.\nWe test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs. For our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative analysis for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values. Any impairment charges incurred are not reversed if a subsequent evaluation concludes a higher valuation than the carrying value.\nFixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies\nWe define a fixed asset as a unit of property that (i) has an economic useful life that extends beyond 12 months and (ii) was acquired or produced for a cost greater than $2,500 for a single asset or greater than $5,000 for a group of assets. Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated fair values. We acquired Bronco Billy's in May 2016, Silver Slipper in October 2012, Rising Star in April 2011 and Stockman's in January 2007. Project development costs, which are amounts expended on the pursuit of new business opportunities, and acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are also expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors and property taxes. Salaries are capitalized only for employees working directly on the project. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is sometimes a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur, which would change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nGoodwill and Business Combinations\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of net tangible and other intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. We accounted for our acquisitions of casino properties for Bronco Billy's, Silver Slipper and Rising Star as business combinations. In a business combination, we determine the fair value of acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests, if any. The fair value of the acquired business is allocated to the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and non-controlling interests based on their fair value, with any remaining fair value allocated to goodwill. This allocation process requires use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets.\nIntangible Assets\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include the cost of gaming licenses and trade names. Gaming licenses represent the rights to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions, and trade names represent the fair value of the casino name's brand recognition. The value of our gaming licenses were primarily estimated using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The value of the Bronco Billy's trade names utilized the relief from royalty\u201d method, which primarily utilizes comparable royalty agreements to determine value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, unless it is determined that their useful life is no longer indefinite. We periodically review our indefinite-lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue\nto support an indefinite useful life. If it is determined that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has a finite useful life, then the asset is tested for impairment and is subsequently accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets include customer loyalty programs, land leases, payments for a lease option and water rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual or economic useful lives.\nCustomer loyalty programs represent the value of repeat business associated with the casinos' loyalty programs when we acquired the properties. Such values were determined using a derivation of the income approach to valuation. The valuation analyses for the active-rated players were based on estimated revenues and attrition rates. Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel and Rising Star Casino Resort maintain historical information for the proportion of revenues attributable to the rated play, which acquisition costs were allocated to such customer loyalty programs. The combined value of the customer loyalty programs have since been fully-amortized over their assumed economic useful life, but remains a component of gross intangible assets other than goodwill, and comprises a majority of the related accumulated amortization. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies follow casino industry practices. Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with certain liabilities recognized, including progressive jackpots, earned customer loyalty incentives, funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs, and for certain chips and tokens in the customers' possession. Key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot coin-in and table game drop (volume indicators) and win\u201d or hold\u201d percentage.\nRevenue for food and beverage, hotel, and other revenue transactions is typically the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services, plus the retail value of (i) discretionary comps and (ii) comps provided in return for redemption of loyalty points. We record such revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer. Additionally, we may collect deposits in advance for future hotel reservations or entertainment, among other services, which represent obligations to the Company until the service is provided to the customer. Sales and similar revenue-linked taxes (except for gaming taxes) collected from customers on behalf of, and submitted to, taxing authorities are also excluded from revenue and recorded as a current liability.\nCustomer Loyalty Programs\nWe have separate customer loyalty programs at each of our properties - Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, Bronco Billy's MVP Most Valuable Players\u201d Club, Rising Star Rewards Club\u2122, Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club\u00ae and the Stockman's Winner's Club. Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays, among others, depending on each property's specific offers. We also occasionally offer sweepstakes and other promotions for tracked customers that do not require redemption of points.\nAs points are accrued, we defer a portion of our gaming revenue based on the estimated standalone value of loyalty points being earned by the customer. The standalone value of loyalty points is derived from the retail value of food, beverages, hotel rooms, and other goods or services for which such points may be redeemed. A liability related to these customer loyalty points is recorded, net of estimated breakage and other factors, until the customer redeems these points, primarily for free casino play/cash back,\u201d complimentary dining, or hotel stays. Upon redemption, the related revenue is recognized at retail value within the department providing the goods or services. Unredeemed points are forfeited if the customer becomes and remains inactive for a specified period of time.\nLoyalty programs are a part of the total marketing program. The amount of marketing reinvestment (complimentaries to players, promotional awards, entertainment, etc.) is based on the specific property and competitive assumptions. We track the percentage of promotional and marketing costs, compared to gaming revenue, for an efficient use and return on our marketing investment. Our properties operate in highly-competitive promotional environments due to the high amounts of incentives offered by our competition.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of casino, hotel and other receivables, are typically non-interest bearing, and are carried net of an appropriate collection allowance to approximate fair value. The allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, as well as, historical collection experience and current economic and business\nconditions. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible, and recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions, including fundamental changes to the applicable tax laws.\nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not\u201d threshold. It is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nCommon Stock Warrant Liability\nWe measure the fair value of our common stock warrants at each reporting period based on Level 3 inputs as determined by GAAP. Due to the variable terms regarding the timing of the settlement of the warrants, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo\u201d simulation approach, a mathematical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes, to measure the fair value of the warrants. The simulation included certain estimates by Company management regarding the estimated timing of the settlement of the warrants. Significant increases or decreases in those management estimates would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value measurement of our warrant liability are measured quarterly, including changes caused by increases or decreases in our stock price, and are expensed or credited to income during the measurement period.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe have granted shares of common stock and stock options to key members of management and the board of directors. Accounting standards require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. Share-based compensation expense from stock awards is included in general and administrative expense. Vesting is contingent upon certain conditions, including continuous service of the individual recipients. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued. The Black-Scholes-determined fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the service period.\nRecently Issued Accounting"}
