We completed the sale of our Decatur office on January 24, 2014. Our primary market area includes Berrien County, Van Buren County, and, to a lesser extent, Cass County, Michigan, all of which are located in southwestern Michigan near the border of Indiana, and portions of northern Indiana that are contiguous with Berrien and Cass Counties.\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, $45.4 million, or 42.0% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the FHLB-Indianapolis for asset/liability management purposes and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations. At December 31, 2015, we had $8.0 million in advances outstanding with FHLB-Indianapolis.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking activities, gain on sales of securities, and miscellaneous other income. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, interchange, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nLegacy Loan Losses\nPrior to 2009, our previous management team engaged in significant non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development lending, and relied on inadequate underwriting processes and controls in extending credit. In addition, weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets beginning in 2008 in many portions of the United States, including our market area, contributed to a challenging environment for financial institutions. Due to these adverse conditions, our market area experienced substantial declines in home prices, historically low levels of existing home sale activity, high levels of foreclosures and high levels of unemployment.\nAs a result of the economic conditions and loan origination practices by our previous management team, Edgewater Bank experienced unusually high levels of classified loans and charge-offs, particularly in speculative construction and land development loans in the years following 2009.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have branded and market Edgewater Bank as The Real Local Bank\u201d because we are the only remaining bank or savings association headquartered in St. Joseph, Michigan. Our principal objective is to continually develop our model of personalized customer service, localized decision-making, employee\ninvolvement and efficiency to become the financial institution of choice for more customers in our communities and to fulfill our corporate mission: To Profitably Provide Complete Financial Solutions and Total Customer Satisfaction\u201d.\nSubject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to take advantage of unique opportunities presented by the geographic characteristics of our market area and our evolving customer base to increase our residential mortgage lending and our generation of low-cost core deposits. In order to diversify our portfolio and increase profitability, we also intend to develop a portfolio of commercial and industrial loans, including loans guaranteed by the SBA, and significantly increase our consumer loan portfolio. We will continue to originate commercial real estate loans secured by properties in our market area where we have or can develop a banking relationship with the borrower. We do not currently contemplate engaging in speculative construction and land development lending.\nWe intend to focus on relationship-based banking, rather than simply generating loan originations, and customer service, and will continue to hire additional personnel with residential, commercial and consumer lending experience, which we expect will allow us to develop a broader, more flexible array of residential, commercial and industrial and consumer loan products specifically suited to the customers and potential customers in our market area. In addition, we intend to develop and offer additional financial products targeted at business and individual customers who desire full service, high touch\u201d banking and a full complement of efficient electronic banking services.\nWe believe a disciplined approach to managing the size and diversification of our balance sheet, a renewed focus on personalized service to broaden customer relationships, a continued commitment to improving and managing asset quality, eliminating unproductive spending and enhancing our data processing and reporting technologies will enable us to operate efficiently and profitably and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. Highlights of our current business strategy, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\nImprove our asset quality by continuing to reduce loan delinquencies and classified loans and improving our risk profile through enhancements of our credit risk management systems and credit administration procedures. We are committed to actively monitoring and managing all segments of our loan portfolio in an effort to proactively identify and mitigate credit risks within our loan portfolio, with a particular focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We have implemented a policy of conducting both internal and external reviews of our loan portfolio designed to provide early detection of potential problem loans and timely resolution of non-performing and classified loans, and have tasked the credit administration department with conducting internal reviews and stress-testing.\nOf the $1.6 million in classified assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.2 million were originated before January 2009. Of the $1.6 million in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.4 million were originated before January 2009. Accordingly, we believe that our improved underwriting procedures have been effective in limiting classified and non-performing assets.\nPrudently and opportunistically grow our assets and liabilities by increasing our presence in the communities we serve. We believe that in order to increase our income, we must focus on growing our loan portfolio. Our total assets increased $13.0 million, or 10.7%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015, from $122.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our total loan portfolio, before allowance for loan losses, increased $17.5 million, or 19.3%, to $108.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $90.5 million at December 31, 2014. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners, high net worth individuals, and small- to medium-sized traditional commercial and industrial customers and professional organizations such as medical and dental practices, law firms and accounting firms.\nIncrease our focus on commercial and industrial and consumer lending in our market area, while continuing to originate commercial real estate and residential construction loans on a selective basis. Although residential mortgage lending historically has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of our lending operations, we believe that the impact of potential changes in market interest rates on residential mortgage loans may have on loan origination volume require a prudent approach to expanding our organic origination of commercial and industrial and consumer loans is essential not only to our profitability but also to the maintenance of a diverse and balanced loan portfolio. We will avoid significant\nconcentrations within the loan portfolio, especially in non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development loans.\nExpand originations of residential real estate mortgage loans. We recognize that residential real estate mortgage lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. We believe that our unique geographical market area on the shore of Lake Michigan, the increasing number of individuals from nearby urban areas such as Chicago, Indianapolis, and Detroit and the growing medical professional community present a significant opportunity for us to expand our residential mortgage lending activities in and around St. Joseph.\nContinue to sell fixed-rate loans and retain variable rate and certain fixed-rate loans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $16.4 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans and sold $14.7 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $279,000, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we originated $15.3 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans for sale and sold $6.9 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $141,000. We plan to maintain an appropriately sized portfolio of adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans to meet the needs of borrowers in our market area, increase the yield of our loan portfolio as market interest rates rise, assist in the management of our interest rate risk and manage both the maturity of the loan portfolio and the time it takes for loans to reprice in accordance with their terms. We intend to sell the majority of the long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis in order to increase servicing fee income, recognize gains on sale and manage the overall maturity of our loan portfolio.\nIncrease our loan portfolio by initiating a warehouse line participation. We continue to expand our portfolio by partnering with another financial institution who funds 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. A line of credit is extended to a specific mortgage company that allows the company to fund and close the loan before the loan is sold and funded to a third party. The partner financial institution underwrites each individual mortgage with financing provided to the approved mortgage company for the origination and sale of the loan. A portion of each individual mortgage is assigned to the Company until the loan is sold on the secondary market. These loans typically are sold within 30 to 90 days. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 million in outstanding balances.\nContinue to generate low-cost deposits within our market area. We offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts (which we refer to as core\u201d deposits), which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2015, approximately 75.7% of our deposits were core deposits. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits within our market area, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, broadening banking relationships with lending customers, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the varied demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, high-yield checking for higher balances, and low-cost overdraft for lower balances.\nEnhance our menu of product offerings and continue to improve customer service to meet the demands of current customers and attract new customers in our market area. We expect to focus on existing customers and target potential customers to whom personalized, high touch\u201d service and customized products are more important than traditional factors such as the size or number of locations of the bank, including high net worth or high income individuals and professionals such as doctors, accountants, attorneys and small business owners. In order to attract and retain these customers, we intend to increase our consumer lending activities in the areas of automobile, watercraft, and recreational vehicle loans as well as home equity term loans and lines of credit; develop a broader, more flexible array of residential mortgage products, such as FHA, VA, rural development and jumbo mortgage loans; continue to expand our offering of investment products, enter into an arrangement with a third party to offer trust services; enhance the efficiency of technology-based services that we offer, including debit cards, internet banking, electronic bill pay, mobile banking, ACH services and wire services, and add additional services such as remote deposit capture; and offer extended customer service hours. We also intend to market packages of products and services that are tailored to meet the needs of specific customer groups, such as our Professional Edge\u201d package, which is designed for professional customers and includes preferred rates and fees, free consultation on investment services, and personalized assistance with transitioning from a customer's current bank to Edgewater Bank.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to achieve profitability to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio. Our strategic plan assumed that, beginning in 2015, we would not incur the same level of charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, write downs on real estate owned and losses on sales of real estate owned or expenses related to problem assets as we have in recent periods. However, the conversion has had a short-term adverse impact on our operating results, due to additional costs related to becoming a public company and increased compensation expenses associated with our employee stock ownership. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives and the development and marketing of new products and services. Accordingly, as we successfully implement our strategic plan, we do anticipate a continued return to profitability during 2016. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic plan, and therefore may not return to profitability in the timeframe that we expect or at all.\nAnticipated Increase in Noninterest Expense\nOur noninterest expense is expected to increase because of the increased costs associated with operating as a public company, and the increased compensation expenses associated with the purchase of shares of common stock by our employee stock ownership plan and the possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. Finally, we expect that we will add additional lending staff, which will increase our compensation costs.\nThese costs are expected to be offset by reductions in expenses of approximately $260,000 per year related to our Decatur office, which we sold on January 24, 2014; expenses of approximately $50,000 per year related to the lease of our Buchanan office, which we sold and now lease from the buyer.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.\nManagement performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan's carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.\nFair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Bank estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Bank estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature an imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 12 of the Financial Statements - Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.\u201d\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased by $13.0 million, or 19.5%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $123.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of increases in loans of\u2009 $17.5 million and, offset by decreases in interest-earning demand accounts of\u2009 $2.7 million, available for sale securities of\u2009 $1.0 million, Federal Home Loan Bank stock of\u2009 $393,000, premises and equipment of $306,000 and other real estate of\u2009 $205,000.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased by $17.5 million, or 19.5%, to $107.0 million at December 31, 2014 from $89.5 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we originated $16.4 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and sold $14.7 million in the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2015, one- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $49,000 or .1%, to $45.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $45.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial real estate loans increased $4.5 million, or 16.0%, to $32.4 million from $27.9 million; construction and land loans increased $453,000, or 29.7%, to $2.0 million from $1.5 million; commercial and industrial loans increased $2.6 million, or 47.2% to $8.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2014, the warehouse line increased to $10 million at December 31, 2015 from zero at December 31, 2014, and consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $111,000, or 1.11%, to $10.1 million from $10.2 million. Decreases in loan balances reflect repayments in excess of originations and loan sales.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased $1.0 million, or 7.9%, to $11.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $12.7 million at December 31, 2014. Mortgage-backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased $1.2 million, or 9.3%, to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.4 million at December 31, 2014, and states and political subdivision securities decreased $802,000, or 23.9%, to $2.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. U.S. government and federal agency securities increased $985,000, or 19.9%, to $5.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.9 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $1.0 million in U.S. government and federal agency securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not sell any securities during\n2015 or 2014. The yield on our investment securities decreased to 1.37% at December 31, 2015 from 1.39% at December 31, 2014 as a result of the pay downs and decreased yields on securities during the period. Net unrealized losses on securities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3,000 to an unrealized loss of\u2009 $14,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to a unrealized loss of\u2009 $17,000 at December 31, 2014, reflecting an increase in interest rates during the period. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted entirely of government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, government-sponsored debentures, municipal securities, and U.S. government and agency securities with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned held for sale decreased $205,000, or 43.9% to $262,000 at December 31, 2015 from $467,000 at December 31, 2014, as we sold $299,000 of foreclosed properties and foreclosed on $99,000 of non-performing loans, recorded $5,000 valuation adjustments and $167 in net losses on sales. At December 31, 2015 our real estate owned included one commercial real estate property and residential lots, the largest of which was a commercial property with a carrying value of\u2009 $202,000.\nDeposits. Deposits increased by $14.8 million, or 15.1%, to $113.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $98.5 million at December 31, 2014. Our core deposits increased $14.2 million, or 19.8%, to $85.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $71.6 million at December 31, 2014. Certificates of deposit increased $656,000 or 2.4%, to $27.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $26.9 million at December 31, 2014. The sale of our Decatur office, on January 24, 2014, resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.3 million in deposits, including $8.4 million in core deposits and $4.9 million in certificates of deposit.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $2.0 million, or 20%, to $8.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $10.0 million at December 31, 2014. We incurred $10.0 million in additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances in January, 2014 in order to fund the sale of our Decatur office that are now maturing and being paid off. Other liabilities which includes interest and accounts payable, customer escrow balances and accruals for items such as employee pension and insurance premiums were $672,000 on December 31, 2015 and $548,000 on December 31, 2014, a decrease of\u2009 $125,000, or 22.8%.\nTotal Equity. Total equity increased $69,000, or .5%, to $13.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $13.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42,000, compared to net loss of $816,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase to net income was primarily due to increases in interest income on loans and an increase in income related to mortgage banking activities.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $655,000, or 15.8%, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of a $709,000 increase in interest and fee income on loans receivable and a $55,000 decrease in interest on investment securities. Approximately, $119,000 of interest income was collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $13.3 million to $ 101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the average yield on loans increased by 12 basis points to 4.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.37% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of investment securities decreased $2.2 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the yield on investment securities decreased by 2 basis points to 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.39% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The slight decrease in average yield on securities was due to the pay downs of lower yielding securities, as well as our decision to manage liquidity by investing in shorter-term securities, which generally bear interest at a lower rate than longer-term securities.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $43,000, or 8.8%, to $536,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $24,000, or 6.2%, to $410,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $386,000 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to an average balance increase of\u2009 $6.1 million, or 7.3% to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield cost remained the same at .46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advances increased $20,000, or 18.9%, to $126,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of advances increased by $3.4 million to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we borrowed funds for the loan growth that occurred.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $612,000, or 16.8%, to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted primarily from an increase of\u2009 $655,000 in interest income offset by an increase of\u2009 $43,000 in interest expense. Our average net interest-earning assets increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased to 3.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.17% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net interest margin also increased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.26% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected primarily the $119,000 of interest income collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan An increase in interest rates and a decline in refinancing activity in future periods may materially decrease our income from residential mortgage banking activities and commercial real estate activities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of\u2009 $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a provision of\u2009 $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was largely the result of management's estimates regarding losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate as well as the volume increase in the loan portfolio. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's classified assets decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014. The Bank was in a net charge off position of\u2009 $65,000 which increased the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses was $1.1 million or 1.00% of total loans at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 million or 1.19% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming loans were $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 81.4% at December 31, 2015 compared to 37.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $450,000 and $1.5 million of nonperforming loans were contractually current.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $188,000, or 24.9% to $944,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $787,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was related to an increase of\u2009 $198,000 in income related to mortgage banking activities, resulting from an increase in one-to-four family mortgage loan originations and sales, net of a decrease in service charge on deposits of $6,000. There was slightly decrease in other income of\u2009 $3,000.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expenses decreased $124,000, or 2.4%, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily reflected a decrease of\u2009 $55,000 in expenses related to real estate owned, a decrease of\u2009 $85,000 in professional expenses, a decrease of\u2009 $44,000 in FDIC insurance premium, and in occupancy and equipment expenses of\u2009 $50,000 which was offset by an increase of\u2009 $118,000 salaries and employee benefits and an increase in data processing of\u2009 $26,000.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are accreted to interest income.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the

Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset-Liability Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors.\nOur asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\n\u2022\noriginating commercial and industrial, consumer and commercial real estate loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger non-interest bearing checking accounts;\n\u2022\nselling substantially all of our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate and retaining certain fixed-rate loans and the majority of the adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs;\n\u2022\nlengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis;\n\u2022\nreducing our dependence on the acquisition of certificates of deposits to support lending and investment activity;\n\u2022\ninvesting in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and\n\u2022\nincreasing non-interest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our Asset/Liability Committee, which is comprised of our executive management team and other essential operational staff. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities. We also engage a third party asset/liability advisor, who meets with our Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis and with our Board of Directors at least annually.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a five year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning December 31, 2015 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Rate Shift(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Interest Income\nYear 1 Forecast\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year 1 Change\nfrom Level\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Level\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nThe calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide\nan indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\nIn order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The Board of Directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Edgewater Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE as Percentage of\nEconomic Value of Assets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in Interest\nRates (basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated EVE(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Changes in Basis Points\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.03% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.56) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(817) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAssumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates.\n(2)\nEVE or Economic Value of Equity at Risk measures the Bank's exposure to equity due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment.\n(3)\nEVE Ratio represents Economic Value of Equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings.\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2015, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 3.1% increase in net portfolio value. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 2.7% decrease in net portfolio value.\nDepending on the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, we may place greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or re-pricing of our assets and liabilities can, during periods of declining or stable interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify an increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. We believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using this approach.\nWe do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB-Indianapolis. At December 31, 2015, we had the capacity to borrow approximately $12.4 million from the FHLB-Indianapolis and an additional $2 million on a line of credit with the FHLB-Indianapolis with an additional $2 million line of credit with United Bankers Bank. We drew $10.0 million in January 2014 to fund the sale of the Decatur office, and at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $8.0 million and $10.0 respectively, outstanding in advances from the FHLB-Indianapolis.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided (used) in operating activities was $781,000 and ($267,000) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities and sale of the Decatur branch, was ($16.2 million) and $(12.7 million) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we purchased $1 million and $0, respectively and sold no securities in 2015 and 2014, in securities held as available-for-sale. We sold the Decatur branch using $13.3 million to fund the deposit and facility sale during the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and escrow deposits for the stock conversion was $12.8 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, resulting from our strategy of managing growth to preserve capital ratios and reduce expenses.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nAt December 31, 2015, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of\u2009 $12.6 million, or 9.42% of adjusted total assets, which is above the required level of\u2009 $6.7 million, or 5.00%; Common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital level of\u2009 $12.6 million or 14.16% to risk-weighted assets which is above the required level of\u2009 $5.8 million or 6.50% and $7.1 million or 8.00%, respectively and total risk-based capital of\u2009 $13.7 million, or 15.37% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of\u2009 $8.9 million, or 10.00%. At December 31, 2014, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a tier 1 leverage capital level of\u2009 $12.3 million, or 10.03% of adjusted total assets,\nwhich is above the required level of\u2009 $6.1 million, or 5.00%; and total risk-based capital of\u2009 $13.2 million, or 17.87% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of\u2009 $7.4 million, or 10.00%. Accordingly, Edgewater Bank was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of\u2009 $6.5 million, unused lines of credit totaling $12.4 million, and stand-by letters of credit of\u2009 $80,000. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2015 totaled $16.2 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 beginning on page for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Price\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.", "summary": "- The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco reported net income

our main office in St. Joseph, Michigan and our four additional full-service banking offices located in Royalton Township, Coloma, Bridgman and Buchanan, Michigan. We completed the sale of our Decatur office on January 24, 2014. Our primary market area includes Berrien County, Van Buren County, and, to a lesser extent, Cass County, Michigan, all of which are located in southwestern Michigan near the border of Indiana, and portions of northern Indiana that are contiguous with Berrien and Cass Counties.\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, $45.4 million, or 42.0% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the FHLB-Indianapolis for asset/liability management purposes and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations. At December 31, 2015, we had $8.0 million in advances outstanding with FHLB-Indianapolis.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking activities, gain on sales of securities, and miscellaneous other income. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, interchange, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nLegacy Loan Losses\nPrior to 2009, our previous management team engaged in significant non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development lending, and relied on inadequate underwriting processes and controls in extending credit. In addition, weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets beginning in 2008 in many portions of the United States, including our market area, contributed to a challenging environment for financial institutions. Due to these adverse conditions, our market area experienced substantial declines in home prices, historically low levels of existing home sale activity, high levels of foreclosures and high levels of unemployment.\nAs a result of the economic conditions and loan origination practices by our previous management team, Edgewater Bank experienced unusually high levels of classified loans and charge-offs, particularly in speculative construction and land development loans in the years following 2009.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have branded and market Edgewater Bank as The Real Local Bank\u201d because we are the only remaining bank or savings association headquartered in St. Joseph, Michigan. Our principal objective is to continually develop our model of personalized customer service, localized decision-making, employee\ninvolvement and efficiency to become the financial institution of choice for more customers in our communities and to fulfill our corporate mission: To Profitably Provide Complete Financial Solutions and Total Customer Satisfaction\u201d.\nSubject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to take advantage of unique opportunities presented by the geographic characteristics of our market area and our evolving customer base to increase our residential mortgage lending and our generation of low-cost core deposits. In order to diversify our portfolio and increase profitability, we also intend to develop a portfolio of commercial and industrial loans, including loans guaranteed by the SBA, and significantly increase our consumer loan portfolio. We will continue to originate commercial real estate loans secured by properties in our market area where we have or can develop a banking relationship with the borrower. We do not currently contemplate engaging in speculative construction and land development lending.\nWe intend to focus on relationship-based banking, rather than simply generating loan originations, and customer service, and will continue to hire additional personnel with residential, commercial and consumer lending experience, which we expect will allow us to develop a broader, more flexible array of residential, commercial and industrial and consumer loan products specifically suited to the customers and potential customers in our market area. In addition, we intend to develop and offer additional financial products targeted at business and individual customers who desire full service, high touch\u201d banking and a full complement of efficient electronic banking services.\nWe believe a disciplined approach to managing the size and diversification of our balance sheet, a renewed focus on personalized service to broaden customer relationships, a continued commitment to improving and managing asset quality, eliminating unproductive spending and enhancing our data processing and reporting technologies will enable us to operate efficiently and profitably and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. Highlights of our current business strategy, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\nImprove our asset quality by continuing to reduce loan delinquencies and classified loans and improving our risk profile through enhancements of our credit risk management systems and credit administration procedures. We are committed to actively monitoring and managing all segments of our loan portfolio in an effort to proactively identify and mitigate credit risks within our loan portfolio, with a particular focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We have implemented a policy of conducting both internal and external reviews of our loan portfolio designed to provide early detection of potential problem loans and timely resolution of non-performing and classified loans, and have tasked the credit administration department with conducting internal reviews and stress-testing.\nOf the $1.6 million in classified assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.2 million were originated before January 2009. Of the $1.6 million in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.4 million were originated before January 2009. Accordingly, we believe that our improved underwriting procedures have been effective in limiting classified and non-performing assets.\nPrudently and opportunistically grow our assets and liabilities by increasing our presence in the communities we serve. We believe that in order to increase our income, we must focus on growing our loan portfolio. Our total assets increased $13.0 million, or 10.7%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015, from $122.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our total loan portfolio, before allowance for loan losses, increased $17.5 million, or 19.3%, to $108.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $90.5 million at December 31, 2014. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners, high net worth individuals, and small- to medium-sized traditional commercial and industrial customers and professional organizations such as medical and dental practices, law firms and accounting firms.\nIncrease our focus on commercial and industrial and consumer lending in our market area, while continuing to originate commercial real estate and residential construction loans on a selective basis. Although residential mortgage lending historically has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of our lending operations, we believe that the impact of potential changes in market interest rates on residential mortgage loans may have on loan origination volume require a prudent approach to expanding our organic origination of commercial and industrial and consumer loans is essential not only to our profitability but also to the maintenance of a diverse and balanced loan portfolio. We will avoid significant\nconcentrations within the loan portfolio, especially in non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development loans.\nExpand originations of residential real estate mortgage loans. We recognize that residential real estate mortgage lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. We believe that our unique geographical market area on the shore of Lake Michigan, the increasing number of individuals from nearby urban areas such as Chicago, Indianapolis, and Detroit and the growing medical professional community present a significant opportunity for us to expand our residential mortgage lending activities in and around St. Joseph.\nContinue to sell fixed-rate loans and retain variable rate and certain fixed-rate loans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $16.4 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans and sold $14.7 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $279,000, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we originated $15.3 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans for sale and sold $6.9 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $141,000. We plan to maintain an appropriately sized portfolio of adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans to meet the needs of borrowers in our market area, increase the yield of our loan portfolio as market interest rates rise, assist in the management of our interest rate risk and manage both the maturity of the loan portfolio and the time it takes for loans to reprice in accordance with their terms. We intend to sell the majority of the long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis in order to increase servicing fee income, recognize gains on sale and manage the overall maturity of our loan portfolio.\nIncrease our loan portfolio by initiating a warehouse line participation. We continue to expand our portfolio by partnering with another financial institution who funds 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. A line of credit is extended to a specific mortgage company that allows the company to fund and close the loan before the loan is sold and funded to a third party. The partner financial institution underwrites each individual mortgage with financing provided to the approved mortgage company for the origination and sale of the loan. A portion of each individual mortgage is assigned to the Company until the loan is sold on the secondary market. These loans typically are sold within 30 to 90 days. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 million in outstanding balances.\nContinue to generate low-cost deposits within our market area. We offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts (which we refer to as core\u201d deposits), which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2015, approximately 75.7% of our deposits were core deposits. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits within our market area, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, broadening banking relationships with lending customers, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the varied demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, high-yield checking for higher balances, and low-cost overdraft for lower balances.\nEnhance our menu of product offerings and continue to improve customer service to meet the demands of current customers and attract new customers in our market area. We expect to focus on existing customers and target potential customers to whom personalized, high touch\u201d service and customized products are more important than traditional factors such as the size or number of locations of the bank, including high net worth or high income individuals and professionals such as doctors, accountants, attorneys and small business owners. In order to attract and retain these customers, we intend to increase our consumer lending activities in the areas of automobile, watercraft, and recreational vehicle loans as well as home equity term loans and lines of credit; develop a broader, more flexible array of residential mortgage products, such as FHA, VA, rural development and jumbo mortgage loans; continue to expand our offering of investment products, enter into an arrangement with a third party to offer trust services; enhance the efficiency of technology-based services that we offer, including debit cards, internet banking, electronic bill pay, mobile banking, ACH services and wire services, and add additional services such as remote deposit capture; and offer extended customer service hours. We also intend to market packages of products and services that are tailored to meet the needs of specific customer groups, such as our Professional Edge\u201d package, which is designed for professional customers and includes preferred rates and fees, free consultation on investment services, and personalized assistance with transitioning from a customer's current bank to Edgewater Bank.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to achieve profitability to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio. Our strategic plan assumed that, beginning in 2015, we would not incur the same level of charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, write downs on real estate owned and losses on sales of real estate owned or expenses related to problem assets as we have in recent periods. However, the conversion has had a short-term adverse impact on our operating results, due to additional costs related to becoming a public company and increased compensation expenses associated with our employee stock ownership. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives and the development and marketing of new products and services. Accordingly, as we successfully implement our strategic plan, we do anticipate a continued return to profitability during 2016. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic plan, and therefore may not return to profitability in the timeframe that we expect or at all.\nAnticipated Increase in Noninterest Expense\nOur noninterest expense is expected to increase because of the increased costs associated with operating as a public company, and the increased compensation expenses associated with the purchase of shares of common stock by our employee stock ownership plan and the possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. Finally, we expect that we will add additional lending staff, which will increase our compensation costs.\nThese costs are expected to be offset by reductions in expenses of approximately $260,000 per year related to our Decatur office, which we sold on January 24, 2014; expenses of approximately $50,000 per year related to the lease of our Buchanan office, which we sold and now lease from the buyer.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.\nManagement performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan's carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.\nFair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Bank estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Bank estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature an imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 12 of the Financial Statements - Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.\u201d\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased by $13.0 million, or 19.5%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $123.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of increases in loans of\u2009 $17.5 million and, offset by decreases in interest-earning demand accounts of\u2009 $2.7 million, available for sale securities of\u2009 $1.0 million, Federal Home Loan Bank stock of\u2009 $393,000, premises and equipment of $306,000 and other real estate of\u2009 $205,000.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased by $17.5 million, or 19.5%, to $107.0 million at December 31, 2014 from $89.5 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we originated $16.4 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and sold $14.7 million in the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2015, one- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $49,000 or .1%, to $45.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $45.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial real estate loans increased $4.5 million, or 16.0%, to $32.4 million from $27.9 million; construction and land loans increased $453,000, or 29.7%, to $2.0 million from $1.5 million; commercial and industrial loans increased $2.6 million, or 47.2% to $8.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2014, the warehouse line increased to $10 million at December 31, 2015 from zero at December 31, 2014, and consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $111,000, or 1.11%, to $10.1 million from $10.2 million. Decreases in loan balances reflect repayments in excess of originations and loan sales.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased $1.0 million, or 7.9%, to $11.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $12.7 million at December 31, 2014. Mortgage-backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased $1.2 million, or 9.3%, to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.4 million at December 31, 2014, and states and political subdivision securities decreased $802,000, or 23.9%, to $2.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. U.S. government and federal agency securities increased $985,000, or 19.9%, to $5.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.9 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $1.0 million in U.S. government and federal agency securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not sell any securities during\n2015 or 2014. The yield on our investment securities decreased to 1.37% at December 31, 2015 from 1.39% at December 31, 2014 as a result of the pay downs and decreased yields on securities during the period. Net unrealized losses on securities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3,000 to an unrealized loss of\u2009 $14,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to a unrealized loss of\u2009 $17,000 at December 31, 2014, reflecting an increase in interest rates during the period. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted entirely of government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, government-sponsored debentures, municipal securities, and U.S. government and agency securities with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned held for sale decreased $205,000, or 43.9% to $262,000 at December 31, 2015 from $467,000 at December 31, 2014, as we sold $299,000 of foreclosed properties and foreclosed on $99,000 of non-performing loans, recorded $5,000 valuation adjustments and $167 in net losses on sales. At December 31, 2015 our real estate owned included one commercial real estate property and residential lots, the largest of which was a commercial property with a carrying value of\u2009 $202,000.\nDeposits. Deposits increased by $14.8 million, or 15.1%, to $113.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $98.5 million at December 31, 2014. Our core deposits increased $14.2 million, or 19.8%, to $85.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $71.6 million at December 31, 2014. Certificates of deposit increased $656,000 or 2.4%, to $27.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $26.9 million at December 31, 2014. The sale of our Decatur office, on January 24, 2014, resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.3 million in deposits, including $8.4 million in core deposits and $4.9 million in certificates of deposit.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $2.0 million, or 20%, to $8.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $10.0 million at December 31, 2014. We incurred $10.0 million in additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances in January, 2014 in order to fund the sale of our Decatur office that are now maturing and being paid off. Other liabilities which includes interest and accounts payable, customer escrow balances and accruals for items such as employee pension and insurance premiums were $672,000 on December 31, 2015 and $548,000 on December 31, 2014, a decrease of\u2009 $125,000, or 22.8%.\nTotal Equity. Total equity increased $69,000, or .5%, to $13.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $13.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42,000, compared to net loss of $816,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase to net income was primarily due to increases in interest income on loans and an increase in income related to mortgage banking activities.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $655,000, or 15.8%, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of a $709,000 increase in interest and fee income on loans receivable and a $55,000 decrease in interest on investment securities. Approximately, $119,000 of interest income was collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $13.3 million to $ 101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the average yield on loans increased by 12 basis points to 4.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.37% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of investment securities decreased $2.2 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the yield on investment securities decreased by 2 basis points to 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.39% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The slight decrease in average yield on securities was due to the pay downs of lower yielding securities, as well as our decision to manage liquidity by investing in shorter-term securities, which generally bear interest at a lower rate than longer-term securities.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $43,000, or 8.8%, to $536,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $24,000, or 6.2%, to $410,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $386,000 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to an average balance increase of\u2009 $6.1 million, or 7.3% to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield cost remained the same at .46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advances increased $20,000, or 18.9%, to $126,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of advances increased by $3.4 million to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we borrowed funds for the loan growth that occurred.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $612,000, or 16.8%, to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted primarily from an increase of\u2009 $655,000 in interest income offset by an increase of\u2009 $43,000 in interest expense. Our average net interest-earning assets increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased to 3.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.17% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net interest margin also increased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.26% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected primarily the $119,000 of interest income collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan An increase in interest rates and a decline in refinancing activity in future periods may materially decrease our income from residential mortgage banking activities and commercial real estate activities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of\u2009 $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a provision of\u2009 $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was largely the result of management's estimates regarding losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate as well as the volume increase in the loan portfolio. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's classified assets decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014. The Bank was in a net charge off position of\u2009 $65,000 which increased the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses was $1.1 million or 1.00% of total loans at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 million or 1.19% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming loans were $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 81.4% at December 31, 2015 compared to 37.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $450,000 and $1.5 million of nonperforming loans were contractually current.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $188,000, or 24.9% to $944,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $787,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was related to an increase of\u2009 $198,000 in income related to mortgage banking activities, resulting from an increase in one-to-four family mortgage loan originations and sales, net of a decrease in service charge on deposits of $6,000. There was slightly decrease in other income of\u2009 $3,000.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expenses decreased $124,000, or 2.4%, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily reflected a decrease of\u2009 $55,000 in expenses related to real estate owned, a decrease of\u2009 $85,000 in professional expenses, a decrease of\u2009 $44,000 in FDIC insurance premium, and in occupancy and equipment expenses of\u2009 $50,000 which was offset by an increase of\u2009 $118,000 salaries and employee benefits and an increase in data processing of\u2009 $26,000.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are accreted to interest income.\n\n(1)\nConsists of stock in the FHLB-Indianapolis and interest bearing deposits in other banks.\n(2)\nNet interest spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.\n(3)\nNet interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(4)\nNet interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume\n(changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.\n\nManagement of Market Risk\nGeneral. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset-Liability Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors.\nOur asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\n\u2022\noriginating commercial and industrial, consumer and commercial real estate loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger non-interest bearing checking accounts;\n\u2022\nselling substantially all of our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate and retaining certain fixed-rate loans and the majority of the adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs;\n\u2022\nlengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis;\n\u2022\nreducing our dependence on the acquisition of certificates of deposits to support lending and investment activity;\n\u2022\ninvesting in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and\n\u2022\nincreasing non-interest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our Asset/Liability Committee, which is comprised of our executive management team and other essential operational staff. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities. We also engage a third party asset/liability advisor, who meets with our Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis and with our Board of Directors at least annually.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a five year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning December 31, 2015 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\n\n(1)\nThe calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide\nan indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\nIn order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The Board of Directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Edgewater Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nEdgewater Bank provides financial services to individuals and businesses from our main office in St. Joseph, Michigan and our four additional full-service banking offices located in Royalton Township, Coloma, Bridgman and Buchanan, Michigan. We completed the sale of our Decatur office on January 24, 2014. Our primary market area includes Berrien County, Van Buren County, and, to a lesser extent, Cass County, Michigan, all of which are located in southwestern Michigan near the border of Indiana, and portions of northern Indiana that are contiguous with Berrien and Cass Counties.\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, $45.4 million, or 42.0% of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the FHLB-Indianapolis for asset/liability management purposes and, to a much lesser extent, for additional funding for our operations. At December 31, 2015, we had $8.0 million in advances outstanding with FHLB-Indianapolis.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking activities, gain on sales of securities, and miscellaneous other income. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, federal deposit insurance premiums, interchange, professional fees, advertising and other operating expenses.\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nLegacy Loan Losses\nPrior to 2009, our previous management team engaged in significant non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development lending, and relied on inadequate underwriting processes and controls in extending credit. In addition, weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets beginning in 2008 in many portions of the United States, including our market area, contributed to a challenging environment for financial institutions. Due to these adverse conditions, our market area experienced substantial declines in home prices, historically low levels of existing home sale activity, high levels of foreclosures and high levels of unemployment.\nAs a result of the economic conditions and loan origination practices by our previous management team, Edgewater Bank experienced unusually high levels of classified loans and charge-offs, particularly in speculative construction and land development loans in the years following 2009.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have branded and market Edgewater Bank as The Real Local Bank\u201d because we are the only remaining bank or savings association headquartered in St. Joseph, Michigan. Our principal objective is to continually develop our model of personalized customer service, localized decision-making, employee\ninvolvement and efficiency to become the financial institution of choice for more customers in our communities and to fulfill our corporate mission: To Profitably Provide Complete Financial Solutions and Total Customer Satisfaction\u201d.\nSubject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to take advantage of unique opportunities presented by the geographic characteristics of our market area and our evolving customer base to increase our residential mortgage lending and our generation of low-cost core deposits. In order to diversify our portfolio and increase profitability, we also intend to develop a portfolio of commercial and industrial loans, including loans guaranteed by the SBA, and significantly increase our consumer loan portfolio. We will continue to originate commercial real estate loans secured by properties in our market area where we have or can develop a banking relationship with the borrower. We do not currently contemplate engaging in speculative construction and land development lending.\nWe intend to focus on relationship-based banking, rather than simply generating loan originations, and customer service, and will continue to hire additional personnel with residential, commercial and consumer lending experience, which we expect will allow us to develop a broader, more flexible array of residential, commercial and industrial and consumer loan products specifically suited to the customers and potential customers in our market area. In addition, we intend to develop and offer additional financial products targeted at business and individual customers who desire full service, high touch\u201d banking and a full complement of efficient electronic banking services.\nWe believe a disciplined approach to managing the size and diversification of our balance sheet, a renewed focus on personalized service to broaden customer relationships, a continued commitment to improving and managing asset quality, eliminating unproductive spending and enhancing our data processing and reporting technologies will enable us to operate efficiently and profitably and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. Highlights of our current business strategy, subject to regulatory approval where applicable and market conditions, are set forth below.\nImprove our asset quality by continuing to reduce loan delinquencies and classified loans and improving our risk profile through enhancements of our credit risk management systems and credit administration procedures. We are committed to actively monitoring and managing all segments of our loan portfolio in an effort to proactively identify and mitigate credit risks within our loan portfolio, with a particular focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We have implemented a policy of conducting both internal and external reviews of our loan portfolio designed to provide early detection of potential problem loans and timely resolution of non-performing and classified loans, and have tasked the credit administration department with conducting internal reviews and stress-testing.\nOf the $1.6 million in classified assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.2 million were originated before January 2009. Of the $1.6 million in non-performing assets as of December 31, 2015, $1.4 million were originated before January 2009. Accordingly, we believe that our improved underwriting procedures have been effective in limiting classified and non-performing assets.\nPrudently and opportunistically grow our assets and liabilities by increasing our presence in the communities we serve. We believe that in order to increase our income, we must focus on growing our loan portfolio. Our total assets increased $13.0 million, or 10.7%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015, from $122.3 million at December 31, 2014. Our total loan portfolio, before allowance for loan losses, increased $17.5 million, or 19.3%, to $108.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $90.5 million at December 31, 2014. To better serve and expand our customer base we intend to develop and continually review a pricing model that will attract prospective customers, particularly homeowners, high net worth individuals, and small- to medium-sized traditional commercial and industrial customers and professional organizations such as medical and dental practices, law firms and accounting firms.\nIncrease our focus on commercial and industrial and consumer lending in our market area, while continuing to originate commercial real estate and residential construction loans on a selective basis. Although residential mortgage lending historically has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of our lending operations, we believe that the impact of potential changes in market interest rates on residential mortgage loans may have on loan origination volume require a prudent approach to expanding our organic origination of commercial and industrial and consumer loans is essential not only to our profitability but also to the maintenance of a diverse and balanced loan portfolio. We will avoid significant\nconcentrations within the loan portfolio, especially in non-owner occupied commercial real estate and speculative construction and land development loans.\nExpand originations of residential real estate mortgage loans. We recognize that residential real estate mortgage lending is essential to maintaining customer relations and our status as a community-oriented bank, and also creates invaluable ties to the communities that we serve. We believe that our unique geographical market area on the shore of Lake Michigan, the increasing number of individuals from nearby urban areas such as Chicago, Indianapolis, and Detroit and the growing medical professional community present a significant opportunity for us to expand our residential mortgage lending activities in and around St. Joseph.\nContinue to sell fixed-rate loans and retain variable rate and certain fixed-rate loans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $16.4 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans and sold $14.7 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $279,000, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we originated $15.3 million of one to four-family residential real estate loans for sale and sold $6.9 million for gains on sale of\u2009 $141,000. We plan to maintain an appropriately sized portfolio of adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans to meet the needs of borrowers in our market area, increase the yield of our loan portfolio as market interest rates rise, assist in the management of our interest rate risk and manage both the maturity of the loan portfolio and the time it takes for loans to reprice in accordance with their terms. We intend to sell the majority of the long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis in order to increase servicing fee income, recognize gains on sale and manage the overall maturity of our loan portfolio.\nIncrease our loan portfolio by initiating a warehouse line participation. We continue to expand our portfolio by partnering with another financial institution who funds 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. A line of credit is extended to a specific mortgage company that allows the company to fund and close the loan before the loan is sold and funded to a third party. The partner financial institution underwrites each individual mortgage with financing provided to the approved mortgage company for the origination and sale of the loan. A portion of each individual mortgage is assigned to the Company until the loan is sold on the secondary market. These loans typically are sold within 30 to 90 days. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 million in outstanding balances.\nContinue to generate low-cost deposits within our market area. We offer checking, NOW, savings and money market deposit accounts (which we refer to as core\u201d deposits), which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2015, approximately 75.7% of our deposits were core deposits. We intend to pursue increased origination of these low cost deposits within our market area, with particular focus on transaction accounts, by implementing pro-active marketing and promotional programs, broadening banking relationships with lending customers, offering attractive interest rates, and offering competitive products to meet the needs of the varied demographic groups in our market areas, such as remote deposit capture for business customers, high-yield checking for higher balances, and low-cost overdraft for lower balances.\nEnhance our menu of product offerings and continue to improve customer service to meet the demands of current customers and attract new customers in our market area. We expect to focus on existing customers and target potential customers to whom personalized, high touch\u201d service and customized products are more important than traditional factors such as the size or number of locations of the bank, including high net worth or high income individuals and professionals such as doctors, accountants, attorneys and small business owners. In order to attract and retain these customers, we intend to increase our consumer lending activities in the areas of automobile, watercraft, and recreational vehicle loans as well as home equity term loans and lines of credit; develop a broader, more flexible array of residential mortgage products, such as FHA, VA, rural development and jumbo mortgage loans; continue to expand our offering of investment products, enter into an arrangement with a third party to offer trust services; enhance the efficiency of technology-based services that we offer, including debit cards, internet banking, electronic bill pay, mobile banking, ACH services and wire services, and add additional services such as remote deposit capture; and offer extended customer service hours. We also intend to market packages of products and services that are tailored to meet the needs of specific customer groups, such as our Professional Edge\u201d package, which is designed for professional customers and includes preferred rates and fees, free consultation on investment services, and personalized assistance with transitioning from a customer's current bank to Edgewater Bank.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions, regulatory restrictions and other factors. We have adopted a strategic plan to achieve profitability to increase our earnings base, especially the size of our loan portfolio. Our strategic plan assumed that, beginning in 2015, we would not incur the same level of charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, write downs on real estate owned and losses on sales of real estate owned or expenses related to problem assets as we have in recent periods. However, the conversion has had a short-term adverse impact on our operating results, due to additional costs related to becoming a public company and increased compensation expenses associated with our employee stock ownership. In addition, growth of earning assets is essential to our future profitability, and we expect to incur expenses related to the implementation of our growth plan, including hiring initiatives and the development and marketing of new products and services. Accordingly, as we successfully implement our strategic plan, we do anticipate a continued return to profitability during 2016. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic plan, and therefore may not return to profitability in the timeframe that we expect or at all.\nAnticipated Increase in Noninterest Expense\nOur noninterest expense is expected to increase because of the increased costs associated with operating as a public company, and the increased compensation expenses associated with the purchase of shares of common stock by our employee stock ownership plan and the possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. Finally, we expect that we will add additional lending staff, which will increase our compensation costs.\nThese costs are expected to be offset by reductions in expenses of approximately $260,000 per year related to our Decatur office, which we sold on January 24, 2014; expenses of approximately $50,000 per year related to the lease of our Buchanan office, which we sold and now lease from the buyer.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company\u201d we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.\nManagement performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan's carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.\nFair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Bank estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Bank estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature an imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 12 of the Financial Statements - Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.\u201d\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased by $13.0 million, or 19.5%, to $135.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $123.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of increases in loans of\u2009 $17.5 million and, offset by decreases in interest-earning demand accounts of\u2009 $2.7 million, available for sale securities of\u2009 $1.0 million, Federal Home Loan Bank stock of\u2009 $393,000, premises and equipment of $306,000 and other real estate of\u2009 $205,000.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased by $17.5 million, or 19.5%, to $107.0 million at December 31, 2014 from $89.5 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we originated $16.4 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and sold $14.7 million in the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2015, one- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $49,000 or .1%, to $45.4 million at December 31, 2015 from $45.4 million at December 31, 2014, commercial real estate loans increased $4.5 million, or 16.0%, to $32.4 million from $27.9 million; construction and land loans increased $453,000, or 29.7%, to $2.0 million from $1.5 million; commercial and industrial loans increased $2.6 million, or 47.2% to $8.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2014, the warehouse line increased to $10 million at December 31, 2015 from zero at December 31, 2014, and consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased $111,000, or 1.11%, to $10.1 million from $10.2 million. Decreases in loan balances reflect repayments in excess of originations and loan sales.\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased $1.0 million, or 7.9%, to $11.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $12.7 million at December 31, 2014. Mortgage-backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased $1.2 million, or 9.3%, to $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.4 million at December 31, 2014, and states and political subdivision securities decreased $802,000, or 23.9%, to $2.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2014. U.S. government and federal agency securities increased $985,000, or 19.9%, to $5.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $4.9 million at December 31, 2013. We purchased $1.0 million in U.S. government and federal agency securities during the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not sell any securities during\n2015 or 2014. The yield on our investment securities decreased to 1.37% at December 31, 2015 from 1.39% at December 31, 2014 as a result of the pay downs and decreased yields on securities during the period. Net unrealized losses on securities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3,000 to an unrealized loss of\u2009 $14,000 at December 31, 2015 compared to a unrealized loss of\u2009 $17,000 at December 31, 2014, reflecting an increase in interest rates during the period. At December 31, 2015, investment securities classified as available-for-sale consisted entirely of government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, government-sponsored debentures, municipal securities, and U.S. government and agency securities with a focus on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned held for sale decreased $205,000, or 43.9% to $262,000 at December 31, 2015 from $467,000 at December 31, 2014, as we sold $299,000 of foreclosed properties and foreclosed on $99,000 of non-performing loans, recorded $5,000 valuation adjustments and $167 in net losses on sales. At December 31, 2015 our real estate owned included one commercial real estate property and residential lots, the largest of which was a commercial property with a carrying value of\u2009 $202,000.\nDeposits. Deposits increased by $14.8 million, or 15.1%, to $113.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $98.5 million at December 31, 2014. Our core deposits increased $14.2 million, or 19.8%, to $85.8 million at December 31, 2015 from $71.6 million at December 31, 2014. Certificates of deposit increased $656,000 or 2.4%, to $27.5 million at December 31, 2015 from $26.9 million at December 31, 2014. The sale of our Decatur office, on January 24, 2014, resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.3 million in deposits, including $8.4 million in core deposits and $4.9 million in certificates of deposit.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Liabilities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $2.0 million, or 20%, to $8.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $10.0 million at December 31, 2014. We incurred $10.0 million in additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances in January, 2014 in order to fund the sale of our Decatur office that are now maturing and being paid off. Other liabilities which includes interest and accounts payable, customer escrow balances and accruals for items such as employee pension and insurance premiums were $672,000 on December 31, 2015 and $548,000 on December 31, 2014, a decrease of\u2009 $125,000, or 22.8%.\nTotal Equity. Total equity increased $69,000, or .5%, to $13.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $13.3 million at December 31, 2014.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $42,000, compared to net loss of $816,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase to net income was primarily due to increases in interest income on loans and an increase in income related to mortgage banking activities.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $655,000, or 15.8%, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of a $709,000 increase in interest and fee income on loans receivable and a $55,000 decrease in interest on investment securities. Approximately, $119,000 of interest income was collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $13.3 million to $ 101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, while the average yield on loans increased by 12 basis points to 4.49% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.37% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of investment securities decreased $2.2 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the yield on investment securities decreased by 2 basis points to 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.39% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The slight decrease in average yield on securities was due to the pay downs of lower yielding securities, as well as our decision to manage liquidity by investing in shorter-term securities, which generally bear interest at a lower rate than longer-term securities.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $43,000, or 8.8%, to $536,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $24,000, or 6.2%, to $410,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $386,000 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to an average balance increase of\u2009 $6.1 million, or 7.3% to $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $83.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average yield cost remained the same at .46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advances increased $20,000, or 18.9%, to $126,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $106,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average balance of advances increased by $3.4 million to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as we borrowed funds for the loan growth that occurred.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $612,000, or 16.8%, to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase resulted primarily from an increase of\u2009 $655,000 in interest income offset by an increase of\u2009 $43,000 in interest expense. Our average net interest-earning assets increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our net interest rate spread increased to 3.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.17% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net interest margin also increased to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.26% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected primarily the $119,000 of interest income collected on a paid off nonaccrual loan An increase in interest rates and a decline in refinancing activity in future periods may materially decrease our income from residential mortgage banking activities and commercial real estate activities.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on our analysis of the factors described in Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d we recorded a provision for loan losses of\u2009 $65,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a provision of\u2009 $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was largely the result of management's estimates regarding losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate as well as the volume increase in the loan portfolio. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's classified assets decreased $1.7 million from December 31, 2014. The Bank was in a net charge off position of\u2009 $65,000 which increased the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses was $1.1 million or 1.00% of total loans at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 million or 1.19% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Total nonperforming loans were $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $2.9 million at December 31, 2014. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 81.4% at December 31, 2015 compared to 37.1% at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $450,000 and $1.5 million of nonperforming loans were contractually current.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $188,000, or 24.9% to $944,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $787,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was related to an increase of\u2009 $198,000 in income related to mortgage banking activities, resulting from an increase in one-to-four family mortgage loan originations and sales, net of a decrease in service charge on deposits of $6,000. There was slightly decrease in other income of\u2009 $3,000.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expenses decreased $124,000, or 2.4%, to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease primarily reflected a decrease of\u2009 $55,000 in expenses related to real estate owned, a decrease of\u2009 $85,000 in professional expenses, a decrease of\u2009 $44,000 in FDIC insurance premium, and in occupancy and equipment expenses of\u2009 $50,000 which was offset by an increase of\u2009 $118,000 salaries and employee benefits and an increase in data processing of\u2009 $26,000.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset-Liability Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors.\nOur asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:\n\u2022\noriginating commercial and industrial, consumer and commercial real estate loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger non-interest bearing checking accounts;\n\u2022\nselling substantially all of our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate and retaining certain fixed-rate loans and the majority of the adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs;\n\u2022\nlengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis;\n\u2022\nreducing our dependence on the acquisition of certificates of deposits to support lending and investment activity;\n\u2022\ninvesting in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and\n\u2022\nincreasing non-interest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest margin and interest rate spread.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our Asset/Liability Committee, which is comprised of our executive management team and other essential operational staff. This committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a gap analysis\u201d of the discrepancy between the repricing of our assets and liabilities. We also engage a third party asset/liability advisor, who meets with our Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis and with our Board of Directors at least annually.\nNet Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over a five year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning December 31, 2015 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Rate Shift(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Interest Income\nYear 1 Forecast\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year 1 Change\nfrom Level\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Level\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-2.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nThe calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide\nan indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.\nIn order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value of equity at risk ( NPV\u201d) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates\u201d column below. The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The Board of Directors and management review the methodology's measurements on a quarterly basis.\nThe interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management's best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Edgewater Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE as Percentage of\nEconomic Value of Assets(3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in Interest\nRates (basis points)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated EVE(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> EVE Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Changes in Basis Points\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,263) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.8)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.03% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.56) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(817) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>"}
