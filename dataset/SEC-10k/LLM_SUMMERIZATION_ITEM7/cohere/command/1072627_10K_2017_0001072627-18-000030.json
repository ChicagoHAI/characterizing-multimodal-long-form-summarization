MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank with a focus on long-term value-creation. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the insurance, extended warranty, asset management and real estate industries and pursues non-control investments and other opportunities acting as an advisor, an investor and a financier. Kingsway conducts its business through the following three reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting, Extended Warranty (formerly Insurance Services) and Leased Real Estate.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nInsurance Underwriting provides non-standard automobile insurance to individuals who do not meet the criteria for coverage by standard automobile insurers. Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 states; however new business is accepted in only eight states. In 2017, production in the following states represented 90.1% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida (28.0%), Texas (16.8%), California (13.3%), Nevada (12.1%), Illinois (10.5%) and Colorado (9.4%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nExtended Warranty includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation (\"IWS\"), Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC (\"Trinity\") and Professional Warranty Service Corporation (\"PWSC\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Extended Warranty\" is used to refer to this segment. Prior to the second quarter of 2017, Extended Warranty was referred to as Insurance Services.\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 23 states and the District of Columbia to their members.\nTrinity sells warranty products and provides maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\nPWSC sells new home warranty products and provides administration services to home builders and homeowners across the United States. PWSC distributes its products and services through an in house sales team and through insurance brokers and insurance carriers throughout all states except Alaska and Louisiana.\nLeased Real Estate includes the Company's subsidiary, CMC Industries, Inc. (\"CMC\"). CMC owns, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Property Owner\"), a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 192 acres located in the State of Texas (the \"Real Property\"), which is subject to a long-term triple net lease agreement. The Real Property is also subject to a mortgage, which is recorded as note payable in the consolidated balance sheets (the \"Mortgage\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Leased Real Estate\" is used to refer to this segment.\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Extended Warranty segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Extended Warranty segment.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this 2017 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net (loss) income, we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment; however, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 24, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense which, in addition to segment operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of intangible assets, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net, foreign exchange losses, net, (loss) gain on change in fair value of debt, gain (loss) on deconsolidation of subsidiaries and equity in net income (loss) of investees. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nGross Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nNet Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; impairment assessment of investments; valuation of limited liability investment, at fair value; valuation of deferred income taxes; valuation and impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; and fair value assumptions for subordinated debt obligations.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this 2017 Annual Report and Note 13, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company utilizes external actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. The provision is evaluated by the Company's actuaries with the results then shared with management, which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nBecause the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated. The Company's actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any fixed maturities and equity investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs.\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nImpairment Assessment of Investments\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying other circumstances management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nValuation of Limited Liability Investment, at Fair Value\nIn connection with the deconsolidation of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\") during the third quarter of 2016, the Company retained a minority investment in 1347 Investors. The Company has made an irrevocable election to account for this investment at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of this investment is calculated based on a model that distributes the net equity of 1347 Investors to all classes of membership interests. The model uses quoted market prices and significant market observable inputs.\nValuation of Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $181.2 million, $174.8 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, all or a portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nValuation and Impairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database, customer relationships, contract-based revenues and in-place lease. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nintangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of a tenant relationship, insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded. During 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets in 2016 or 2015. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 11, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 10, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 6, \"Investments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value Assumptions for Subordinated Debt Obligations\nOur subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value.

The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by operating income in Extended Warranty and Leased Real Estate, net investment income, net realized gains, equity in net income of investees and income tax benefit. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by net investment income, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary and income tax benefit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported net loss of 11.1 million ($0.73 per diluted share) compared to net income of $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $126.9 million compared to $132.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 4.4% decrease. Net premiums written decreased 4.2% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net premiums earned increased 2.2% to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums earned generally reflects the natural lag between when premiums are written and when they are earned. The more recent trend of net premiums written decreasing year over year will eventually lead to a year over year decrease in net premiums earned. Of particular note, the Company had approximately 12% fewer policies in force at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease in policies in force reflects the Company's actions throughout 2017 to increase rates, revise payment terms and invoke certain market restrictions, all with the intention of improving the profitability of the Company's business.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating loss is primarily explained by the difference between the $20.7 million of unfavorable development in the provision for property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in 2017 for accident years 2016 and prior compared to the $8.1 million of unfavorable development recorded in 2016 for accident years 2015 and prior.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 81.8% in 2016. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased unfavorable development recorded in 2017 as compared to the unfavorable development recorded in 2016.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 23.5% in 2017 compared with 25.0% in 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to increased net premiums earned as well as lower salary and benefits expense at Mendota and MCC and lower bad debt expense at Mendota for 2017 as compared to 2016, despite the 2016 expense ratio reflecting a one-time benefit of $0.5 million related to the settlement of outstanding litigation.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 116.1% in 2017 compared with 106.8% in 2016, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 31.8% to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. IWS experienced increased sales of vehicle service agreements due to higher automobile sales and improved penetration of its credit union distribution channel. Trinity experienced increased sales to existing customers of both its maintenance support and warranty products. The increase in service fee and commission income is also reflective of the inclusion of PWSC in 2017 following its acquisition effective October 12, 2017. PWSC service fee and commission income was $2.4 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\nThe Extended Warranty operating income was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income is due to the inclusion of PWSC in 2017, as noted above, as well as improved revenues, partially offset by related increases in cost of services sold at Trinity and commission expense at IWS, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. PWSC operating income was $0.9 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The 2017 rental income is reflective of a lease amendment that was executed effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 whereby the tenant will pay an aggregate $25.0 million of additional rental income through May 2034, the remaining term of the lease (the \"Lease Amendment\"). The Leased Real Estate operating income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $6.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income decreased to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 is primarily explained by the difference between the $0.4 million net investment loss recorded during 2017 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value compared to the $4.7 million net investment income recorded during 2016 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $3.8 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016. The net realized gains in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $1.2 million in 2016.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.2 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The asset purchase agreements executed by the Company in 2012 and 2013 related to the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity, respectively, provided for additional payments to the former owners of IWS and Trinity contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments.\nThe benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owner of Trinity. The parties to the Trinity agreement agreed to a fixed payment in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The parties to the IWS agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has total contingent liabilities of $0.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2017 was $5.0 million compared to $4.5 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 is attributable to generally higher London interbank offered interest rates for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\") during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's subordinated debt bears interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $9.4 million in 2017 compared to $7.6 million in 2016. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of more general and administrative expense for compensation, employee benefits and professional fees in 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of a financing lease, as further discussed in Note 15, \"Finance Lease Obligation Liability,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $0.0 million in 2016.\nLoss on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $3.7 million in 2016. The loss for 2017 and 2016 is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nPrior to the third quarter of 2016, the Company owned 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors. Because the Company owned more than 50% of the outstanding units, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of 1347 Investors. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company's ownership percentage in 1347 Investors was reduced to 26.7%. As a result of this change in ownership, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million during the third quarter of 2016. This gain results from removing the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in 1347 Investors and the carrying value of the consolidated net assets of 1347 Investors, which the Company reported prior to the closing of the transaction, and recording the fair value of the Company's 26.7% retained noncontrolling investment in 1347 Investors as of the transaction date. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Investees\nEquity in net income of investees was $2.1 million in 2017 compared to equity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million in 2016. Equity in net income (loss) of investees represents the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for 2017 was $17.8 million compared to $9.7 million in 2016. The 2017 income tax benefit is primarily related to a release of deferred income tax liabilities and an adjustment to the deferred income tax valuation allowance resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax income assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. In December of 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company recorded provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes. The Company recorded a $19.0 million decrease to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, $18.9 million of which related to a decrease in the Company's net deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 2017 because of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough the $19.0 million tax benefit represents what the Company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. Any adjustments to the Company's provisional amounts will be reported as a component of the consolidated statements of operations during the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, all of which will be reported no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC.\nSee Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nA reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Table 2 below:\nTable 2 Segment Operating (Loss) Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Underwriting\n</td> <td>(8,202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extended Warranty\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Leased Real Estate\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>(7,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>8,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(837\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment loss\n</td> <td>(157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration benefit\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense not allocated to segments\n</td> <td>(4,496\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net\n</td> <td>(7,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses, net\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on change in fair value of debt\n</td> <td>(3,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,179\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on deconsolidation of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>5,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss of investees\n</td> <td>(1,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(10,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(9,720\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11,415\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,012\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net Income and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $0.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) compared to $11.4 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net premiums written increased 14.0% to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net premiums earned increased 8.7% to $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned reflect a change in the mix of business by state resulting from Insurance Underwriting's strategic shift to emphasize certain states and de-emphasize others while also reflecting the competitive market dynamics of each state. Of particular note, the Company had recorded increased premiums written in Florida, Texas and Nevada while reducing premiums written in Virginia, a state in which Insurance Underwriting ceased writing new business beginning in the third quarter of 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned in 2016 as compared to 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded unfavorable development of approximately $9.1 million related to accident years 2015 and prior in the Company's continuing operations, while approximately $1.5 million of favorable development was recorded during the fourth quarter related to the continuing run-offs at Amigo and MCC. In response to industry trends of increasing frequency and severity, Mendota and MCC have been aggressively increasing premium rates throughout the second half of 2016 and into 2017. During this same period, the Company hired several new members to the Insurance Underwriting management team, including a new President and two new Vice Presidents to supervise the Claim Department. The new management team launched a number of initiatives related to increasing policy fee income, reducing bad debt expense, outsourcing the first notice of loss function, outsourcing much of the salvage and subrogation function and entering into an agreement with an outside vendor to migrate to a new policy administration and claim-handling operating platform sometime in 2017.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2016 was 81.8% compared to 74.1% in 2015. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to accident years 2015 and prior as described above.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 25.0% in 2016 compared with 27.4% in 2015. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned and policy fee income for 2016 as compared to 2015. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $9.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 106.8% in 2016 compared with 101.5% in 2015, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 5.2% to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. The Extended Warranty operating income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with operating loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating income is primarily related to lower staff-related expenses at Trinity along with increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The Leased Real Estate operating income was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $2.9 million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased to $8.2 million in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 is is primarily due to income from the Company's investment in 1347 Investors. During 2016, the Company recorded net investment income related to this investment of $4.7 million.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $0.4 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015. The net realized gains in 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.7 million in 2016 compared to $1.1 million in 2015. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The asset purchase agreement executed by the Company in 2012 related to the acquisition of IWS provided that additional payments were due to the former owners of IWS contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. The parties to the agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 is the result of the Company's evaluation of its contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2016 was $4.5 million compared to $5.3 million in 2015. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $7.6 million in 2016 compared to $3.8 million in 2015. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's management services agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 26, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2016, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $1.2 million in 2015. Foreign exchange losses, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\"). The Company deconsolidated KLROC Trust in June\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015. See Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\n(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $3.7 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $1.5 million in 2015. The 2016 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt, whereas the 2015 gain is due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain (Loss) on Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nPrior to the second quarter of 2015, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 74.8% of KLROC Trust. As a result, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Loss of Investees\nEquity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents the loss related to the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit for 2016 was $9.7 million compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC. See Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax (benefit) expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINVESTMENTS\nPortfolio Composition\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.

Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\" section of MD&A.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthere is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell a fixed maturity investment at a loss.\nDue to the inherent volatility of equity markets, we believe an equity investment may trade from time to time below its intrinsic value based on historical valuation measures. In these situations, an equity investment may be maintained in an unrealized loss position for different periods of time based on the underlying economic assumptions driving the investment manager's valuation of the holding.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and equity investments amounted to $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed maturities. At each of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary.\nLimited Liability Investments\nThe Company owns investments in various limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") and limited partnerships (\"LPs\") that primarily invest in income-producing real estate or real estate related investments. The Company's investments in these LLCs and LPs are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and reported as limited liability investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The most recently available financial statements of the LLCs and LPs are used in applying the equity method. The difference between the end of the reporting period of the LLCs and LPs and that of the Company is no more than three months. Most of the real estate investments are held on a triple net lease basis whereby the lessee agrees to pay all real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance.

See Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Tax Act. Non-recurring income tax benefit related to CMC in the table above for the year ended December 31, 2016 is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of the acquisition of CMC.\nWith respect to CMC, the Company expects to record income each year based upon the rental income recognized under its existing triple net lease agreement on the Real Property less operating expenses, which are comprised principally of interest on the Mortgage and depreciation and amortization of certain of the assets acquired. Over the next three years, the Company generally expects to recognize in its consolidated statements of operations income of approximately $2.8 to $3.1 million per year related to its ownership of CMC. Because of the Lease Amendment, CMC may be in a position to distribute to the Company some of the cash received from the additional rental income. Any material cash flow to the Company, however, remains likely to occur only upon the occurrence of one of the three events that would trigger payment of service fees. There can be no assurance as to the timing of the occurrence, or the resulting outcome, from one of these events. Refer to the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section below for further discussion.\nLimited Liability Investment, at Fair Value\nThe Company's investment in 1347 Investors is accounted for at fair value and reported as limited liability investment, at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value was $10.3 million and 10.7 million, respectively.\nOriginally, the Company owned 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors. Because the Company owned more than 50% of the outstanding units, 1347 Investors had been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 1347 Investors had an investment in the common stock and private units of 1347 Capital Corp. which was reflected in investment in investee in the consolidated balance sheets. 1347 Capital Corp. was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\nOn July 21, 2016, Limbach Holdings LLC announced the closing of its previously announced merger with 1347 Capital Corp. and was renamed Limbach Holdings, Inc. (\"Limbach\"). As a result of this transaction, the Company's ownership percentage in 1347 Investors was reduced from 61.0% to 26.7%, leading the Company to record a $5.6 million gain during the third quarter of 2016 related to the deconsolidation of 1347 Investors. This gain resulted from removing the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in 1347 Investors and the carrying value of the consolidated net assets of 1347 Investors, and recording the fair value at the time of the transaction of the Company's 26.7% retained investment in 1347 Investors. At the time of the transaction, the noncontrolling interest representing 39.0% of 1347 Investors had been carried by the Company at $1.5 million.\nAs a result of recording a gain of $5.6 million in the consolidated statements of operations and a reduction to shareholders' equity of $1.5 million from the removal of the noncontrolling interest in 1347 Investors, the Company reported a net increase in its shareholders' equity of $4.1 million during the third quarter of 2016 related to the closing of the Limbach merger and the related deconsolidation of 1347 Investors. Following the transaction, the principal asset of 1347 Investors is its holdings of Limbach common shares.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company made an irrevocable election to account for its remaining 26.7% investment in 1347 Investors at fair value, with any changes in fair value to be reported in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of this investment is calculated based on a model that distributes the net equity of 1347 Investors to all classes of membership interests. The model uses quoted market prices and significant market observable inputs. The Company recorded net investment loss of $0.4 million and net investment income of $4.7 million related to this investment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nProperty and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events, IBNR loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses.\nTables 6 and 7 present distributions, by line of business, of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses gross and net of external reinsurance, respectively.\nTABLE 6 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - gross\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Business\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-standard automobile\n</td> <td>62,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial automobile\n</td> <td>580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>63,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTABLE 7 Provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses - net of reinsurance recoverable\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Business\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-standard automobile\n</td> <td>62,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial automobile\n</td> <td>572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>63,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Standard Automobile\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our non-standard automobile business were $62.2 million and $52.1 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota.\nCommercial Automobile\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the gross provisions for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

Table 8 identifies the relative contribution of the increases (decreases) in the provisions for property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the respective lines of business and accident years.\nThe unfavorable development in 2017 was primarily related to the increase in property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota. The Company experienced an accelerated recognition and payment of claim exposures during 2017 related to accident years 2016 and prior as a result of two primary factors. First, the non-standard automobile industry experienced an increase in claim severities related to material damage and third-party injury claims. Second, the Company experienced significant disruptions within its claim staff during 2016, resulting in a build-up of its claim inventory. Mendota installed a new claim management team during the fourth quarter of 2016. This new claim management team overhauled the claim department staff and claim processes throughout 2017 and began the task of reducing the pending inventory of open claims; however, the age of the outstanding claims combined with the deteriorating industry trends led to a significant increase in claim payments beyond what had been previously reserved for accident years 2016 and prior. The unfavorable development in 2016 was primarily related to the increase in property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota and MCC, offset by a decrease in property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the continuing voluntary run-off of Amigo. Refer to the \"Results of Continuing Operations, Insurance Underwriting\" section above for further discussion. The unfavorable development in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses at Mendota, offset by a decrease in property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses due to the continuing voluntary run-offs of Amigo and MCC. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims.\nDEBT\nNote Payable\nAs part of the acquisition of CMC, the Company assumed the Mortgage and recorded the Mortgage at its estimated fair value of $191.7 million, which included the unpaid principal amount of $180.0 million as of the date of acquisition plus a premium of $11.7 million. The Mortgage matures on May 15, 2034 and has a fixed interest rate of 4.07%. The Mortgage is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost, which reflects the monthly pay-down of principal as well as the amortization of the premium using the effective interest rate method.\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBank Loan\nOn October 12, 2017, the Company borrowed a principal amount of $5.0 million from a bank to partially finance its acquisition of PWSC. The bank loan matures on October 12, 2022 and has a fixed interest rate of 5.0%. The bank loan is carried in the consolidated balance sheets at its unpaid principal balance.\nSubordinated Debt\nBetween December 4, 2002 and December 16, 2003, six subsidiary trusts of the Company issued $90.5 million of 30-year capital securities to third-parties in separate private transactions. In each instance, a corresponding floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture was then issued by Kingsway America Inc. to the trust in exchange for the proceeds from the private sale. The floating rate debentures bear interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%. The Company has the right to call each of these securities at par value any time after five years from their issuance until their maturity. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company gave notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, pursuant to the contractual terms of its outstanding indentures, which permit interest deferral. This action does not constitute a default under the Company's Trust Preferred indentures or any of its other debt indentures. On November 6, 2015, the Company paid $22.1 million to its Trust Preferred trustees to be used by the trustees to pay the interest which the Company had been deferring since the first quarter of 2011.\nThe Company's subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the subordinated debt is $52.1 million. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third party. For a description of the market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third party used in determining fair value of debt, see Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the market observable swap rates changed, and the Company experienced a decrease in the credit spread assumption developed by the third party. Changes in the market observable swap rates affect the fair value model in different ways. An increase in the LIBOR swap rates has the effect of increasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while an increase in the risk-free swap rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value. The decrease in the credit spread assumption has the effect of increasing the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt while an increase in the credit spread assumption has the effect of decreasing the fair value. The other primary variable affecting the fair value of debt calculation is the passage of time, which will always have the effect of increasing the fair value of debt. The changes to the credit spread and swap rate variables during 2017, along with the passage of time, contributed to the $8.5 million increase in fair value of the Company's subordinated debt between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. This increase in fair value is reported as loss on change in fair value of debt in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThough the changes in the model assumptions will continue to introduce volatility each quarter to the Company's reported gain or loss on change in fair value of debt, the fair value of the Company's subordinated debt will eventually equal the principal value of the subordinated debt by the time of the stated redemption date of each trust, beginning with the trust maturing on December 4, 2032 and continuing through January 8, 2034, the redemption date of the last of the Company's outstanding trusts. As a result, it should be expected that, on average, the Company will continue to report quarterly and annual losses on change in fair value of debt and that from time to time these quarterly and annual losses may be material to the Company's results of operations.\nFor a description of each of the Company's six subsidiary trusts, see Note 14, \"Debt,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, capital raising, disposal of discontinued operations, investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments or from the sale of investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for making investments and for loss and loss adjustment expense payments, debt servicing and other operating expenses. The timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, which may create increased liquidity requirements.\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nDuring 2017, the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $19.0 million. The reconciliation between the Company's reported net loss of $11.1 million and the net cash used in operating activities of $19.0 million can be explained primarily by the deferred income tax benefit of 18.4 million, the increase in other receivables of $3.8 million, the increase in other net assets of $3.8 million, net realized gains of $3.8 million and the decrease in unearned premiums of $3.5 million, partially offset by the increase in liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of $9.7 million, the loss on change in fair value of debt of $8.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $5.6 million and the decrease in premiums and service fee receivable of $2.2 million.\nDuring 2017, the net cash provided by investing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $24.6 million. This source of cash was driven primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities, equity investments, other investments and short-term investments in excess of purchases of fixed maturities, equity investments and limited liability investments and net cash used for acquisition of business.\nDuring 2017, the net cash provided by financing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was $2.2 million. This source of cash is attributed to proceeds from the bank loan net of principal repayments of $4.9 million, partially offset by principal repayments of $2.6 million on the Company's note payable.\nIn summary, as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company's net increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2017 was $7.8 million.\nThe Company's Insurance Underwriting subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through premium and investment income and maturities in the investments portfolios. The Company's Extended Warranty subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through service fee and commission income. The Company's Leased Real Estate subsidiary funds its obligations through rental income.\nThe liquidity of the holding company is managed separately from its subsidiaries. Actions available to the holding company to raise liquidity in order to meet its obligations include the sale of passive investments; sale of subsidiaries; issuance of debt or equity securities; certain excess cash flow from the Company's Extended Warranty subsidiaries and giving notice to its Trust Preferred trustees of its intention to exercise its voluntary right to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, which right the Company previously exercised during the period from the first quarter of 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015.\nReceipt of dividends from the Insurance Underwriting subsidiaries is not generally considered a source of liquidity for the holding company. The insurance subsidiaries require regulatory approval for the return of capital and, in certain circumstances, prior to the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2017, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the Company were restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations.\nReceipt of dividends from the Extended Warranty subsidiaries is limited for the holding company at this time even though excess cash generated by Trinity's operating results is freely available for distribution to the holding company. IWS is somewhat constrained from paying dividends, given the existence of a 10% minority owner of its common equity, and PWSC is constrained from paying dividends while the bank loan incurred to partially finance the acquisition of PWSC remains outstanding.\nReceipt of dividends from the Leased Real Estate segment is not generally considered a source of liquidity for the holding company. Because of the Lease Amendment, CMC may be in a position to distribute to the Company some of the cash received from the additional rental income. Any material cash flow to the Company, however, to help the Company meet its holding company obligations remains likely to occur only upon the occurrence of one of the three events described in the next paragraph that would trigger payment of service fees. There can be no assurance as to the timing of the occurrence, or the resulting outcome, from one of these events.\nPursuant to the terms of the management services agreement entered into at the closing of the acquisition of CMC, an affiliate of the seller (the \"Service Provider\") will provide certain services to CMC and its subsidiaries in exchange for service fees. Such services (collectively, the \"Services\") will include (i) causing an affiliate of the Service Provider to guaranty certain obligations of the Property Owner (pursuant to an Indemnity and Guaranty Agreement between such affiliate and the holder of the Mortgage (the \"Mortgagor\")), (ii) providing certain individuals to serve as members of the board of directors and/or certain executive officers of CMC and/or its subsidiaries and (iii) providing asset management services with respect to the Real Property. In exchange for the Services, the Property Owner will pay certain fees to the Service Provider. The payment of such service fees may be triggered by (i) a sale of the Real Property, (ii) a restructuring of the lease to which the Real Property is subject or (iii) a refinancing or restructuring of the Mortgage. The amount of the service fees will range from 40%-80% of the net proceeds generated by the\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nevent triggering the payment of the service fees (depending on the nature and timing of the triggering event). The Lease Amendment has not triggered the payment of service fees to the Service Provider.\nThe holding company's liquidity, defined as the amount of cash in the bank accounts of Kingsway Financial Services Inc. and Kingsway America Inc., was $0.6 million and $14.9 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These amounts are reflected in the cash and cash equivalents of $44.3 million and $36.5 million reported at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The cash and cash equivalents other than the holding company's liquidity represent restricted and unrestricted cash held by the Company's Insurance Underwriting, Extended Warranty and Leased Real Estate subsidiaries and are not considered to be available to meet holding company obligations, which primarily consist of interest payments on subordinated debt; holding company operating expenses; transaction-driven expenses of the Company's merchant banking activities; investments; and any other extraordinary demands on the holding company.\nThe holding company's liquidity of $0.6 million at December 31, 2017 represented approximately one month of interest payments on subordinated debt and regularly recurring operating expenses before any transaction-driven expenses of the Company's merchant banking activities, any new holding company investments or any other extraordinary demands on the holding company. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, holding company liquidity increased, primarily as a result of the sale of holding company investments. As of the filing date of the Company's 2017 Annual Report, the holding company's liquidity of $6.1 million represented approximately 7 months of interest payments on subordinated debt and regularly recurring operating expenses before any transaction-driven expenses of the Company's merchant banking activities, any new holding company investments or any other extraordinary demands on the holding company.\nWhile the Company believes it has sources of liquidity available to allow it to continue to meet its holding company obligations, there can be no assurance that such sources of liquidity will be available when needed.\nRegulatory Capital\nIn the United States, a risk-based capital (\"RBC\") formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2017, surplus as regards policyholders reported by each of our insurance subsidiaries, with the exception of Mendota, exceeded the 200% threshold.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Mendota's RBC was 196%, which is at the company action level, as defined by the NAIC. Mendota has prepared a comprehensive RBC plan, which it filed with the Minnesota Department of Commerce (\"MNDOC\") on March 15, 2018. The comprehensive plan is intended to outline Mendota's future plans, including the current and projected RBC level, and is subject to approval by the MNDOC. Achievement of the comprehensive plan depends on future events and circumstances, the outcome of which cannot be assured. As part of the Company's response to improve Mendota's RBC and to reduce the risk profile of its business, Mendota entered into a 50% quota share reinsurance agreement with a highly rated reinsurer, effective February 1, 2018, for all premiums written with the exception of premium written in California. The reinsurance arrangement will reduce Mendota's net premiums written during 2018, which will reduce the risk-based capital charge assigned to the business and should, as a result, improve Mendota's RBC. MCC also entered into a 50% quota share reinsurance agreement with the same reinsurer, effective February 1, 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began taking steps to place all of Amigo into voluntary run-off. As of December 31, 2012, Amigo's RBC was 157%. In April 2013, Kingsway filed a comprehensive run-off plan with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which outlines plans for Amigo's run-off. Amigo remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2017, Amigo's RBC was 5,206%.\nKingsway previously placed MCC into voluntary run-off in early 2011. At the time it was placed into voluntary run-off, MCC's RBC was 160%. MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan approved by the Illinois Department of Insurance in June 2011. MCC remains in compliance with that plan. As of December 31, 2017, MCC's RBC was 1,008%.\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, which is domiciled in Barbados, is required by the regulator in Barbados to maintain minimum capital levels. As of December 31, 2017, the capital maintained by Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation was in excess of the regulatory capital requirements in Barbados.\nThe Illinois Department of Insurance completed in 2016 a financial examination of MCC for the five-year period ending December 31, 2015. No financial statement adjustments were required.

In 2017, the MNDOC began a financial examination of Mendota and Mendakota for the five-year period ending December 31, 2016. This examination is expected to be completed by June 30, 2018. Despite the results of the recently completed financial examinations of MCC and Amigo, there can be no assurance that the domiciliary regulators in general, or the MNDOC in particular with respect to the continuing financial examination of Mendota and Mendakota, will not propose financial adjustments or take other actions that would be material to the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTable 9 summarizes cash disbursements related to the Company's contractual obligations projected by period, including debt maturities, interest payments on outstanding debt, the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and future minimum payments under operating leases. Interest payments in Table 9 related to the subordinated debt assume LIBOR remains constant throughout the projection period.\nOur provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses does not have contractual payment dates. In Table 9 below, we have included a projection of when we expect our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses to be paid, based on historical payment patterns. The exact timing of the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses cannot be predicted with certainty. We maintain an investments portfolio with varying maturities and a substantial amount in short-term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the projected payments in Table 9. The unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in Table 9 have not been reduced by amounts recoverable from reinsurers.\nTABLE 9 Cash payments related to contractual obligations projected by period\nAs

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank with a focus on long-term value-creation. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the insurance, extended warranty, asset management and real estate industries and pursues non-control investments and other opportunities acting as an advisor, an investor and a financier. Kingsway conducts its business through the following three reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting, Extended Warranty (formerly Insurance Services) and Leased Real Estate.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nInsurance Underwriting provides non-standard automobile insurance to individuals who do not meet the criteria for coverage by standard automobile insurers. Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 states; however new business is accepted in only eight states. In 2017, production in the following states represented 90.1% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida (28.0%), Texas (16.8%), California (13.3%), Nevada (12.1%), Illinois (10.5%) and Colorado (9.4%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nExtended Warranty includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation (\"IWS\"), Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC (\"Trinity\") and Professional Warranty Service Corporation (\"PWSC\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Extended Warranty\" is used to refer to this segment. Prior to the second quarter of 2017, Extended Warranty was referred to as Insurance Services.\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 23 states and the District of Columbia to their members.\nTrinity sells warranty products and provides maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\nPWSC sells new home warranty products and provides administration services to home builders and homeowners across the United States. PWSC distributes its products and services through an in house sales team and through insurance brokers and insurance carriers throughout all states except Alaska and Louisiana.\nLeased Real Estate includes the Company's subsidiary, CMC Industries, Inc. (\"CMC\"). CMC owns, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Property Owner\"), a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 192 acres located in the State of Texas (the \"Real Property\"), which is subject to a long-term triple net lease agreement. The Real Property is also subject to a mortgage, which is recorded as note payable in the consolidated balance sheets (the \"Mortgage\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Leased Real Estate\" is used to refer to this segment.\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Extended Warranty segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Extended Warranty segment.\n 31 \n\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this 2017 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net (loss) income, we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment; however, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 24, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense which, in addition to segment operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of intangible assets, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net, foreign exchange losses, net, (loss) gain on change in fair value of debt, gain (loss) on deconsolidation of subsidiaries and equity in net income (loss) of investees. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nGross Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nNet Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; impairment assessment of investments; valuation of limited liability investment, at fair value; valuation of deferred income taxes; valuation and impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; and fair value assumptions for subordinated debt obligations.\n 32 \n\nProvision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this 2017 Annual Report and Note 13, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company utilizes external actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. The provision is evaluated by the Company's actuaries with the results then shared with management, which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nBecause the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated. The Company's actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any fixed maturities and equity investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs.\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nImpairment Assessment of Investments\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\n \u2022 identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months; \n \u2022 identifying other circumstances management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions; \n \u2022 obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques; \n \u2022 reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period; \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies; \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record; \n \u2022 determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and \n 33 \n\n \u2022 assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.  The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect; \n \u2022 the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends; \n \u2022 the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and \n \u2022 the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.  As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nValuation of Limited Liability Investment, at Fair Value\nIn connection with the deconsolidation of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\") during the third quarter of 2016, the Company retained a minority investment in 1347 Investors. The Company has made an irrevocable election to account for this investment at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of this investment is calculated based on a model that distributes the net equity of 1347 Investors to all classes of membership interests. The model uses quoted market prices and significant market observable inputs.\nValuation of Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $181.2 million, $174.8 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, all or a portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nValuation and Impairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database, customer relationships, contract-based revenues and in-place lease. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived\n 34 \n\nintangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of a tenant relationship, insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded. During 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets in 2016 or 2015. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 11, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 10, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 6, \"Investments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares.\n 35 \n\nFair Value Assumptions for Subordinated Debt Obligations\nOur subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third party. These inputs include credit spread assumptions developed by a third party and market observable swap rates.\n 36 \n\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nA reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented in Table 1 below:\nTable 1 Segment Operating (Loss) Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\n\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net (Loss) Income and Diluted (Loss) Earnings per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $11.7 million ($0.76 per diluted share) compared to $0.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by operating income in Extended Warranty and Leased Real Estate, net investment income, net realized gains, equity in net income of investees and income tax benefit. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by net investment income, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary and income tax benefit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported net loss of 11.1 million ($0.73 per diluted share) compared to net income of $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 37 \n\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $126.9 million compared to $132.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 4.4% decrease. Net premiums written decreased 4.2% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net premiums earned increased 2.2% to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums earned generally reflects the natural lag between when premiums are written and when they are earned. The more recent trend of net premiums written decreasing year over year will eventually lead to a year over year decrease in net premiums earned. Of particular note, the Company had approximately 12% fewer policies in force at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease in policies in force reflects the Company's actions throughout 2017 to increase rates, revise payment terms and invoke certain market restrictions, all with the intention of improving the profitability of the Company's business.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating loss is primarily explained by the difference between the $20.7 million of unfavorable development in the provision for property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in 2017 for accident years 2016 and prior compared to the $8.1 million of unfavorable development recorded in 2016 for accident years 2015 and prior.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 81.8% in 2016. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased unfavorable development recorded in 2017 as compared to the unfavorable development recorded in 2016.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 23.5% in 2017 compared with 25.0% in 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to increased net premiums earned as well as lower salary and benefits expense at Mendota and MCC and lower bad debt expense at Mendota for 2017 as compared to 2016, despite the 2016 expense ratio reflecting a one-time benefit of $0.5 million related to the settlement of outstanding litigation.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 116.1% in 2017 compared with 106.8% in 2016, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 31.8% to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. IWS experienced increased sales of vehicle service agreements due to higher automobile sales and improved penetration of its credit union distribution channel. Trinity experienced increased sales to existing customers of both its maintenance support and warranty products. The increase in service fee and commission income is also reflective of the inclusion of PWSC in 2017 following its acquisition effective October 12, 2017. PWSC service fee and commission income was $2.4 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\nThe Extended Warranty operating income was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income is due to the inclusion of PWSC in 2017, as noted above, as well as improved revenues, partially offset by related increases in cost of services sold at Trinity and commission expense at IWS, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. PWSC operating income was $0.9 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\n 38 \n\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The 2017 rental income is reflective of a lease amendment that was executed effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 whereby the tenant will pay an aggregate $25.0 million of additional rental income through May 2034, the remaining term of the lease (the \"Lease Amendment\"). The Leased Real Estate operating income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $6.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income decreased to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 is primarily explained by the difference between the $0.4 million net investment loss recorded during 2017 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value compared to the $4.7 million net investment income recorded during 2016 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $3.8 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016. The net realized gains in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $1.2 million in 2016.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.2 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The asset purchase agreements executed by the Company in 2012 and 2013 related to the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity, respectively, provided for additional payments to the former owners of IWS and Trinity contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments.\nThe benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owner of Trinity. The parties to the Trinity agreement agreed to a fixed payment in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The parties to the IWS agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has total contingent liabilities of $0.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 39 \n\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2017 was $5.0 million compared to $4.5 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 is attributable to generally higher London interbank offered interest rates for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\") during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's subordinated debt bears interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $9.4 million in 2017 compared to $7.6 million in 2016. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of more general and administrative expense for compensation, employee benefits and professional fees in 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of a financing lease, as further discussed in Note 15, \"Finance Lease Obligation Liability,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $0.0 million in 2016.\nLoss on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $3.7 million in 2016. The loss for 2017 and 2016 is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nPrior to the third quarter of 2016, the Company owned 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors. Because the Company owned more than 50% of the outstanding units, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of 1347 Investors. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company's ownership percentage in 1347 Investors was reduced to 26.7%. As a result of this change in ownership, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million during the third quarter of 2016. This gain results from removing the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in 1347 Investors and the carrying value of the consolidated net assets of 1347 Investors, which the Company reported prior to the closing of the transaction, and recording the fair value of the Company's 26.7% retained noncontrolling investment in 1347 Investors as of the transaction date. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Investees\nEquity in net income of investees was $2.1 million in 2017 compared to equity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million in 2016. Equity in net income (loss) of investees represents the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for 2017 was $17.8 million compared to $9.7 million in 2016. The 2017 income tax benefit is primarily related to a release of deferred income tax liabilities and an adjustment to the deferred income tax valuation allowance resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax income assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. In December of 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company recorded provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes. The Company recorded a $19.0 million decrease to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, $18.9 million of which related to a decrease in the Company's net deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 2017 because of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.\n 40 \n\nAlthough the $19.0 million tax benefit represents what the Company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. Any adjustments to the Company's provisional amounts will be reported as a component of the consolidated statements of operations during the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, all of which will be reported no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC.\nSee Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nA reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Table 2 below:\nTable 2 Segment Operating (Loss) Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\n\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net Income and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $0.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) compared to $11.4 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by net investment income, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary and income tax benefit. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to operating losses in Insurance Underwriting and Extended Warranty,\n 41 \n\ninterest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary, partially offset by net investment income and gain on change in fair value of debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) compared to $1.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $132.7 million compared to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 14.0% increase. Net premiums written increased 14.0% to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net premiums earned increased 8.7% to $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned reflect a change in the mix of business by state resulting from Insurance Underwriting's strategic shift to emphasize certain states and de-emphasize others while also reflecting the competitive market dynamics of each state. Of particular note, the Company had recorded increased premiums written in Florida, Texas and Nevada while reducing premiums written in Virginia, a state in which Insurance Underwriting ceased writing new business beginning in the third quarter of 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned in 2016 as compared to 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded unfavorable development of approximately $9.1 million related to accident years 2015 and prior in the Company's continuing operations, while approximately $1.5 million of favorable development was recorded during the fourth quarter related to the continuing run-offs at Amigo and MCC. In response to industry trends of increasing frequency and severity, Mendota and MCC have been aggressively increasing premium rates throughout the second half of 2016 and into 2017. During this same period, the Company hired several new members to the Insurance Underwriting management team, including a new President and two new Vice Presidents to supervise the Claim Department. The new management team launched a number of initiatives related to increasing policy fee income, reducing bad debt expense, outsourcing the first notice of loss function, outsourcing much of the salvage and subrogation function and entering into an agreement with an outside vendor to migrate to a new policy administration and claim-handling operating platform sometime in 2017.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2016 was 81.8% compared to 74.1% in 2015. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to accident years 2015 and prior as described above.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 25.0% in 2016 compared with 27.4% in 2015. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned and policy fee income for 2016 as compared to 2015. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $9.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 106.8% in 2016 compared with 101.5% in 2015, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 5.2% to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. The Extended Warranty operating income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with operating loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating income is primarily related to lower staff-related expenses at Trinity along with increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.\n 42 \n\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The Leased Real Estate operating income was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $2.9 million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased to $8.2 million in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 is is primarily due to income from the Company's investment in 1347 Investors. During 2016, the Company recorded net investment income related to this investment of $4.7 million.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $0.4 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015. The net realized gains in 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.7 million in 2016 compared to $1.1 million in 2015. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The asset purchase agreement executed by the Company in 2012 related to the acquisition of IWS provided that additional payments were due to the former owners of IWS contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. The parties to the agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 is the result of the Company's evaluation of its contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2016 was $4.5 million compared to $5.3 million in 2015. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $7.6 million in 2016 compared to $3.8 million in 2015. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's management services agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 26, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2016, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $1.2 million in 2015. Foreign exchange losses, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\"). The Company deconsolidated KLROC Trust in June\n 43 \n\n2015. See Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\n(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $3.7 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $1.5 million in 2015. The 2016 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt, whereas the 2015 gain is due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain (Loss) on Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nPrior to the second quarter of 2015, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 74.8% of KLROC Trust. As a result, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Loss of Investees\nEquity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents the loss related to the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit for 2016 was $9.7 million compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC. See Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax (benefit) expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n 44 \n\nINVESTMENTS\nPortfolio Composition\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. At December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of $145.9 million. Investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Our U.S. operations typically invest in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations.\nTable 3 below summarizes the carrying value of investments, including cash and cash equivalents, at the dates indicated.\nTABLE 3 Carrying value of investments, including cash and cash equivalents\nAs of December 31 (in thousands of dollars, except for percentages)\n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\" section of MD&A.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe length of time a fixed maturity investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of a fixed maturity investment where the investment manager determines that\n 45 \n\nthere is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nKingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank with a focus on long-term value-creation. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the insurance, extended warranty, asset management and real estate industries and pursues non-control investments and other opportunities acting as an advisor, an investor and a financier. Kingsway conducts its business through the following three reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting, Extended Warranty (formerly Insurance Services) and Leased Real Estate.\nInsurance Underwriting includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: Mendota Insurance Company (\"Mendota\"), Mendakota Insurance Company (\"Mendakota\"), Mendakota Casualty Company (\"MCC\"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company (\"Amigo\") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation. Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Insurance Underwriting\" is used to refer to this segment.\nInsurance Underwriting provides non-standard automobile insurance to individuals who do not meet the criteria for coverage by standard automobile insurers. Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 states; however new business is accepted in only eight states. In 2017, production in the following states represented 90.1% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida (28.0%), Texas (16.8%), California (13.3%), Nevada (12.1%), Illinois (10.5%) and Colorado (9.4%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written.\nThe Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015.\nExtended Warranty includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation (\"IWS\"), Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC (\"Trinity\") and Professional Warranty Service Corporation (\"PWSC\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Extended Warranty\" is used to refer to this segment. Prior to the second quarter of 2017, Extended Warranty was referred to as Insurance Services.\nIWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 23 states and the District of Columbia to their members.\nTrinity sells warranty products and provides maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States.\nPWSC sells new home warranty products and provides administration services to home builders and homeowners across the United States. PWSC distributes its products and services through an in house sales team and through insurance brokers and insurance carriers throughout all states except Alaska and Louisiana.\nLeased Real Estate includes the Company's subsidiary, CMC Industries, Inc. (\"CMC\"). CMC owns, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Property Owner\"), a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 192 acres located in the State of Texas (the \"Real Property\"), which is subject to a long-term triple net lease agreement. The Real Property is also subject to a mortgage, which is recorded as note payable in the consolidated balance sheets (the \"Mortgage\"). Throughout this 2017 Annual Report, the term \"Leased Real Estate\" is used to refer to this segment.\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. (\"ARS\"). As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Extended Warranty segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Extended Warranty segment.\n 31 \nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON U.S.-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this 2017 Annual Report, we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance. In addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation of net (loss) income, we show certain statutory reporting information and other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we believe are relevant in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers. These measures are segment operating (loss) income, gross premiums written, net premiums written and underwriting ratios.\nFollowing is a list of non-U.S. GAAP measures found throughout this report with their definitions, relationships to U.S. GAAP measures and explanations of their importance to our operations.\nSegment Operating (Loss) Income\nSegment operating (loss) income represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues. Revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations, but are not subtotaled by segment; however, this information is available in total and by segment in Note 24, \"Segmented Information,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding reportable segment information. The nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measure is loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense which, in addition to segment operating (loss) income, includes net investment income, net realized gains, other-than-temporary impairment loss, amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration benefit, impairment of intangible assets, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net, foreign exchange losses, net, (loss) gain on change in fair value of debt, gain (loss) on deconsolidation of subsidiaries and equity in net income (loss) of investees. A reconciliation of segment operating (loss) income to loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the \"Results of Continuing Operations\" section of MD&A.\nGross Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nNet Premiums Written\nWhile net premiums earned is the related U.S. GAAP measure used in the consolidated statements of operations, net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the effect of ceding reinsurance premiums, but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue. We use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in Insurance Underwriting.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nKingsway, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes; general and administrative expenses and policy fee income by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments; impairment assessment of investments; valuation of limited liability investment, at fair value; valuation of deferred income taxes; valuation and impairment assessment of intangible assets; goodwill recoverability; deferred acquisition costs; fair value assumptions for performance shares; and fair value assumptions for subordinated debt obligations.\n 32 \nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. Further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d section of Part I, Item 1 of this 2017 Annual Report and Note 13, \"Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company utilizes external actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. The provision is evaluated by the Company's actuaries with the results then shared with management, which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year-end actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary and IWS. Unpaid deferred cost containment expenses and unpaid adjusting and other expenses, which are components of the provision for loss adjustment expenses, and unpaid losses are each separately analyzed by line of business and by accident year utilizing a wide range of actuarial methods. These unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are further analyzed by looking separately at case reserves, which are specific reserves established for specific claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\").\nBecause the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated. The Company's actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Maturities and Equity Investments\nOur equity investments, including warrants, are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. For fixed maturities, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. We do not have any fixed maturities and equity investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs.\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nImpairment Assessment of Investments\nThe establishment of an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates. We perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. The analysis includes some or all of the following procedures, as applicable:\n \u2022 identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months; \n \u2022 identifying other circumstances management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions; \n \u2022 obtaining a valuation analysis from third-party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market-based valuation techniques; \n \u2022 reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period; \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third-party rating agencies; \n \u2022 assessing if declines in market value are other-than-temporary for any debt instrument with a non-investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record; \n \u2022 determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other-than-temporary based on the analyses performed; and \n 33 \nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 assessing the Company's ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered.  The risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect; \n \u2022 the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends; \n \u2022 the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company's financial situation; and \n \u2022 the debt service pattern of non-investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company's unknown underlying financial problems.  As a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nValuation of Limited Liability Investment, at Fair Value\nIn connection with the deconsolidation of 1347 Investors LLC (\"1347 Investors\") during the third quarter of 2016, the Company retained a minority investment in 1347 Investors. The Company has made an irrevocable election to account for this investment at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of this investment is calculated based on a model that distributes the net equity of 1347 Investors to all classes of membership interests. The model uses quoted market prices and significant market observable inputs.\nValuation of Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In determining our provision for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies.\nObjective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company's deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $181.2 million, $174.8 million of which relates to its U.S. deferred income taxes. The largest component of the U.S. deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of losses generated from the Company's U.S. operations. Uncertainty over the Company's ability to utilize these losses over the short-term has led the Company to record a valuation allowance.\nFuture events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. If sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard, all or a portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion was reached.\nValuation and Impairment Assessment of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with definite useful lives consist of vehicle service agreements in-force (\"VSA in-force\"), database, customer relationships, contract-based revenues and in-place lease. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived\n 34 \nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nintangible asset be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that definite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of a tenant relationship, insurance licenses and trade name. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. Management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that may affect any resulting impairment write-down. This includes assumptions regarding future cash flows and future revenues from the related intangible assets or their reporting units. Management then compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value of that intangible asset, an impairment is recorded. During 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets in 2016 or 2015. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in Note 11, \"Intangible Assets,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill Recoverability\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the goodwill is impaired, a fair value-based impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts, and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment, if any, by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires management to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill, which is compared to its corresponding carrying value. For reporting units with a negative book value, qualitative factors are evaluated to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 10, \"Goodwill,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nDeferred acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies and vehicle service agreements, are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies and vehicle service agreements. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. For Insurance Underwriting, a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include investments in warrants and performance shares issued to the Company under various performance share grant agreements. Refer to Note 6, \"Investments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details regarding the performance shares. Warrants are classified as equity investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe measure derivative financial instruments at fair value. Warrants are recorded at fair value using quoted market values based on latest bid prices, where active markets exist, or models based on significant market observable inputs, where no active markets exist. The performance shares, for which no active market exists, are required to be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company. Such determination of fair value would require us to develop a model based upon relevant observable market inputs as well as significant unobservable inputs, including developing a sufficiently reliable estimate for an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity and unique structure of the security. The Company determined that its model for the performance shares was not sufficiently reliable. As a result, we have assigned a fair value of zero to the performance shares.\n 35 \nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair Value Assumptions for Subordinated Debt Obligations\nOur subordinated debt is measured and reported at fair value. The fair value of the subordinated debt is calculated using a model based on significant market observable inputs and inputs developed by a third party. These inputs include credit spread assumptions developed by a third party and market observable swap rates.\n 36 \nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nA reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented in Table 1 below:\nTable 1 Segment Operating (Loss) Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Underwriting\n</td> <td>(20,606\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8,202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(12,404\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extended Warranty\n</td> <td>3,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leased Real Estate\n</td> <td>3,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>(13,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>2,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains\n</td> <td>3,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment loss\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration benefit\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense not allocated to segments\n</td> <td>(4,977\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,496\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net\n</td> <td>(9,436\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses, net\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on change in fair value of debt\n</td> <td>(8,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income (loss) of investees\n</td> <td>2,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>3,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(29,416\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18,963\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(17,761\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,720\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(11,655\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on liquidation of subsidiary, net of taxes\n</td> <td>(494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>1,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>(11,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net (Loss) Income and Diluted (Loss) Earnings per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $11.7 million ($0.76 per diluted share) compared to $0.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by operating income in Extended Warranty and Leased Real Estate, net investment income, net realized gains, equity in net income of investees and income tax benefit. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by net investment income, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary and income tax benefit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported net loss of 11.1 million ($0.73 per diluted share) compared to net income of $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 37 \nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $126.9 million compared to $132.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 4.4% decrease. Net premiums written decreased 4.2% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net premiums earned increased 2.2% to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums earned generally reflects the natural lag between when premiums are written and when they are earned. The more recent trend of net premiums written decreasing year over year will eventually lead to a year over year decrease in net premiums earned. Of particular note, the Company had approximately 12% fewer policies in force at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease in policies in force reflects the Company's actions throughout 2017 to increase rates, revise payment terms and invoke certain market restrictions, all with the intention of improving the profitability of the Company's business.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating loss is primarily explained by the difference between the $20.7 million of unfavorable development in the provision for property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in 2017 for accident years 2016 and prior compared to the $8.1 million of unfavorable development recorded in 2016 for accident years 2015 and prior.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 81.8% in 2016. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased unfavorable development recorded in 2017 as compared to the unfavorable development recorded in 2016.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 23.5% in 2017 compared with 25.0% in 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to increased net premiums earned as well as lower salary and benefits expense at Mendota and MCC and lower bad debt expense at Mendota for 2017 as compared to 2016, despite the 2016 expense ratio reflecting a one-time benefit of $0.5 million related to the settlement of outstanding litigation.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 116.1% in 2017 compared with 106.8% in 2016, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 31.8% to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. IWS experienced increased sales of vehicle service agreements due to higher automobile sales and improved penetration of its credit union distribution channel. Trinity experienced increased sales to existing customers of both its maintenance support and warranty products. The increase in service fee and commission income is also reflective of the inclusion of PWSC in 2017 following its acquisition effective October 12, 2017. PWSC service fee and commission income was $2.4 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\nThe Extended Warranty operating income was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating income is due to the inclusion of PWSC in 2017, as noted above, as well as improved revenues, partially offset by related increases in cost of services sold at Trinity and commission expense at IWS, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. PWSC operating income was $0.9 million from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017.\n 38 \nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The 2017 rental income is reflective of a lease amendment that was executed effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 whereby the tenant will pay an aggregate $25.0 million of additional rental income through May 2034, the remaining term of the lease (the \"Lease Amendment\"). The Leased Real Estate operating income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $6.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income decreased to $2.7 million in 2017 compared to $8.2 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 is primarily explained by the difference between the $0.4 million net investment loss recorded during 2017 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value compared to the $4.7 million net investment income recorded during 2016 related to the Company's limited liability investment, at fair value.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $3.8 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016. The net realized gains in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.3 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $1.2 million in 2016.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.2 million in 2017 compared to $0.7 million in 2016. The asset purchase agreements executed by the Company in 2012 and 2013 related to the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity, respectively, provided for additional payments to the former owners of IWS and Trinity contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. Contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the acquisitions of IWS and Trinity were estimated at their respective acquisition dates using valuation models designed to estimate the probability of such contingent payments based on various assumptions. The valuation models assume certain achievement of targets, discount rates related to riskiness of the projections used and the time value of money to calculate the net present value of future consideration payments.\nThe benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owner of Trinity. The parties to the Trinity agreement agreed to a fixed payment in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The parties to the IWS agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has total contingent liabilities of $0.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million related to its insurance licenses indefinite lived intangible asset. The impairment recorded was the result of Mendota and Mendakota surrendering their insurance licenses in the state of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2017. No impairment charges were taken on intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 39 \nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2017 was $5.0 million compared to $4.5 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 is attributable to generally higher London interbank offered interest rates for three-month U.S. dollar deposits (\"LIBOR\") during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's subordinated debt bears interest at the rate of LIBOR, plus spreads ranging from 3.85% to 4.20%.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $9.4 million in 2017 compared to $7.6 million in 2016. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of more general and administrative expense for compensation, employee benefits and professional fees in 2017 as compared to 2016, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain recorded during the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of a financing lease, as further discussed in Note 15, \"Finance Lease Obligation Liability,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $0.0 million in 2016.\nLoss on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $3.7 million in 2016. The loss for 2017 and 2016 is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary\nPrior to the third quarter of 2016, the Company owned 61.0% of the outstanding units of 1347 Investors. Because the Company owned more than 50% of the outstanding units, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of 1347 Investors. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company's ownership percentage in 1347 Investors was reduced to 26.7%. As a result of this change in ownership, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million during the third quarter of 2016. This gain results from removing the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in 1347 Investors and the carrying value of the consolidated net assets of 1347 Investors, which the Company reported prior to the closing of the transaction, and recording the fair value of the Company's 26.7% retained noncontrolling investment in 1347 Investors as of the transaction date. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Income (Loss) of Investees\nEquity in net income of investees was $2.1 million in 2017 compared to equity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million in 2016. Equity in net income (loss) of investees represents the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for 2017 was $17.8 million compared to $9.7 million in 2016. The 2017 income tax benefit is primarily related to a release of deferred income tax liabilities and an adjustment to the deferred income tax valuation allowance resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax income assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. In December of 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the Tax Act but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements.\nPursuant to SAB 118, the Company recorded provisional amounts for the estimated income tax effects of the Tax Act on deferred income taxes. The Company recorded a $19.0 million decrease to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, $18.9 million of which related to a decrease in the Company's net deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 2017 because of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.\n 40 \nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough the $19.0 million tax benefit represents what the Company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Tax Act on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. Any adjustments to the Company's provisional amounts will be reported as a component of the consolidated statements of operations during the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, all of which will be reported no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC.\nSee Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax benefit recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nA reconciliation of total segment operating loss to net income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented in Table 2 below:\nTable 2 Segment Operating (Loss) Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nFor the years ended December 31 (in thousands of dollars)\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Underwriting\n</td> <td>(8,202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extended Warranty\n</td> <td>506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Leased Real Estate\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>(7,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>8,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(837\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment loss\n</td> <td>(157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>(1,242\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration benefit\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense not allocated to segments\n</td> <td>(4,496\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net\n</td> <td>(7,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange losses, net\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on change in fair value of debt\n</td> <td>(3,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,179\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on deconsolidation of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>5,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net loss of investees\n</td> <td>(1,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(10,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(9,720\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11,415\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>10,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of taxes\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,012\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss from Continuing Operations, Net Income and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $0.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) compared to $11.4 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to operating loss in Insurance Underwriting, interest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on change in fair value of debt, partially offset by net investment income, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary and income tax benefit. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to operating losses in Insurance Underwriting and Extended Warranty,\n 41 \nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ninterest expense not allocated to segments, other income and expenses not allocated to segments, net and loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary, partially offset by net investment income and gain on change in fair value of debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) compared to $1.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInsurance Underwriting\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, Insurance Underwriting gross premiums written were $132.7 million compared to $116.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 14.0% increase. Net premiums written increased 14.0% to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $116.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net premiums earned increased 8.7% to $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $117.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned reflect a change in the mix of business by state resulting from Insurance Underwriting's strategic shift to emphasize certain states and de-emphasize others while also reflecting the competitive market dynamics of each state. Of particular note, the Company had recorded increased premiums written in Florida, Texas and Nevada while reducing premiums written in Virginia, a state in which Insurance Underwriting ceased writing new business beginning in the third quarter of 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting operating loss increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributed to an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned in 2016 as compared to 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded unfavorable development of approximately $9.1 million related to accident years 2015 and prior in the Company's continuing operations, while approximately $1.5 million of favorable development was recorded during the fourth quarter related to the continuing run-offs at Amigo and MCC. In response to industry trends of increasing frequency and severity, Mendota and MCC have been aggressively increasing premium rates throughout the second half of 2016 and into 2017. During this same period, the Company hired several new members to the Insurance Underwriting management team, including a new President and two new Vice Presidents to supervise the Claim Department. The new management team launched a number of initiatives related to increasing policy fee income, reducing bad debt expense, outsourcing the first notice of loss function, outsourcing much of the salvage and subrogation function and entering into an agreement with an outside vendor to migrate to a new policy administration and claim-handling operating platform sometime in 2017.\nThe Insurance Underwriting loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2016 was 81.8% compared to 74.1% in 2015. The increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is primarily attributable to the increased loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to accident years 2015 and prior as described above.\nThe Insurance Underwriting expense ratio was 25.0% in 2016 compared with 27.4% in 2015. The decrease in the expense ratio is primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned and policy fee income for 2016 as compared to 2015. The Insurance Underwriting expense ratio includes policy fee income of $9.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nThe Insurance Underwriting combined ratio was 106.8% in 2016 compared with 101.5% in 2015, reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and expense ratio.\nExtended Warranty\nThe Extended Warranty service fee and commission income increased 5.2% to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity. The Extended Warranty operating income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with operating loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating income is primarily related to lower staff-related expenses at Trinity along with increased service fee and commission income at both IWS and Trinity for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.\n 42 \nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeased Real Estate\nLeased Real Estate rental income was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. The rental income is derived from CMC's long-term triple net lease. The Company acquired 81% of CMC on July 14, 2016. The Leased Real Estate operating income was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015. Leased Real Estate operating income includes interest expense of $2.9 million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See \"Investments\" section below for further discussion.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income increased to $8.2 million in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015. The increase in 2016 is is primarily due to income from the Company's investment in 1347 Investors. During 2016, the Company recorded net investment income related to this investment of $4.7 million.\nNet Realized Gains\nThe Company incurred net realized gains of $0.4 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015. The net realized gains in 2016 resulted primarily from the liquidation of equity investments in Insurance Underwriting. The net realized gains in 2015 resulted primarily from the liquidation of limited liability investments in Insurance Underwriting.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company to determine declines in market value that are other-than-temporary, the Company recorded write downs of $0.1 million and $0.1 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to equity investments and limited liability investments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and and $0.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment related to fixed maturities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million in 2016 compared to $1.2 million in 2015.\nContingent Consideration Benefit\nContingent consideration benefit was $0.7 million in 2016 compared to $1.1 million in 2015. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the Company having executed an agreement with the former owners of IWS. The asset purchase agreement executed by the Company in 2012 related to the acquisition of IWS provided that additional payments were due to the former owners of IWS contingent upon the achievement of certain targets over future reporting periods. The parties to the agreement agreed to a fixed payment and other consideration in exchange for extinguishing the rights to future contingent payments. The benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 is the result of the Company's evaluation of its contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 25, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\nInterest Expense not Allocated to Segments\nInterest expense not allocated to segments for 2016 was $4.5 million compared to $5.3 million in 2015. The decrease is attributable to the repayment during June 2015 of the outstanding principal balance on the LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015.\nOther Income and Expenses not Allocated to Segments, Net\nOther income and expenses not allocated to segments was a net expense of $7.6 million in 2016 compared to $3.8 million in 2015. The increase in net expense is primarily the result of a $6.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of 2015 related to the termination of the Company's management services agreement with PIH, as further discussed in Note 26, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by less general expense for salaries in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nForeign Exchange Losses, Net\nDuring 2016, the Company incurred foreign exchange losses, net of $0.0 million compared to $1.2 million in 2015. Foreign exchange losses, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 were incurred primarily related to conversion of the net Canadian dollar assets of Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust (\"KLROC Trust\"). The Company deconsolidated KLROC Trust in June\n 43 \nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015. See Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.\n(Loss) Gain on Change in Fair Value of Debt\nThe loss on change in fair value of debt amounted to $3.7 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $1.5 million in 2015. The 2016 loss is due to an increase in the fair value of the subordinated debt, whereas the 2015 gain is due to a decrease in the fair values of the subordinated debt and LROC preferred units. See \"Debt\" section below for further information.\nGain (Loss) on Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash gain on deconsolidation of 1347 Investors of $5.6 million. Refer to the \"Investments\" section below and Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nPrior to the second quarter of 2015, the Company beneficially owned and controlled 74.8% of KLROC Trust. As a result, the Company had been consolidating the financial statements of KLROC Trust. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in KLROC Trust was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million outstanding on its LROC preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5, \"Deconsolidations, Discontinued Operations and Liquidation,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nEquity in Net Loss of Investees\nEquity in net loss of investees of $1.0 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents the loss related to the Company's investments in Itasca Capital Ltd. and 1347 Capital Corp. See Note 7, \"Investment in Investee,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit for 2016 was $9.7 million compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million in 2015. The 2016 income tax benefit is related to the partial release of the Company's valuation allowance carried against its deferred income tax assets as a result of its acquisition of CMC. See Note 17, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional detail of the income tax (benefit) expense recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n 44 \nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINVESTMENTS\nPortfolio Composition\nAll of our investments in fixed maturities and equity investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
