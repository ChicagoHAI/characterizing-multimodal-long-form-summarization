Our corporate headquarters are in Duluth, Minnesota. Statistical information is presented as of December 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned unless otherwise specifically indicated. References in this report to we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d are to ALLETE and its subsidiaries, collectively.\n2018 Financial Overview\nThe following net income discussion summarizes a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018, to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income attributable to ALLETE in 2018 was $174.1 million, or $3.38 per diluted share, compared to $172.2 million, or $3.38 per diluted share, in 2017. Net income in 2017 included the favorable impacts of $13.0 million after-tax, or $0.25 per share, for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and $7.9 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share, related to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2017 also included a non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge, or $0.22 per share, for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Earnings per share dilution in 2018 was $0.04 due to additional shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nRegulated Operations net income attributable to ALLETE was $131.0 million in 2018, compared to $128.4 million in 2017. Net income at Minnesota Power was higher than 2017 reflecting the non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge in 2017 for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. Net income in 2018 included lower transmission revenue resulting from lower MISO-related revenue and a $3.1 million after-tax out-of-period adjustment for an estimated true-up of MISO rates that were billed in 2017 and are expected to be credited to customers in 2019, the timing of fuel adjustment clause recoveries, lower industrial sales, and higher property tax and interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expense, higher pricing on PSAs with Other Power Suppliers, increased cost recovery rider revenue, and higher sales to residential and commercial customers due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018. Net income in 2018 also included higher depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, which was offset by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. Net income at SWL&P and our after-tax equity earnings in ATC were similar to 2017.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Financial Overview (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy net income attributable to ALLETE was $33.7 million in 2018 compared to $41.5 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities, a lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA and $7.4 million after-tax of additional production tax credits generated as ALLETE Clean Energy continues to execute its refurbishment strategy. Of the $7.4 million after-tax in additional production tax credits, $3.0 million resulted from the retrospective qualification of additional wind turbine generators in 2016 and 2017. These increases were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses.\nU.S. Water Services net income attributable to ALLETE was $3.2 million in 2018, compared to $10.7 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2018 included $0.6 million of after-tax expense recognized as cost of sales related to purchase accounting for sales backlog.\nCorporate and Other net income attributable to ALLETE was $6.2 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included additional income tax expense of $19.8 million after-tax for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2018 included an increase for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million after-tax as compared to 2017.\n2018 Compared to 2017\n(See Note 17.

This decrease in revenue was offset by the income tax impacts of the regulatory outcome resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Expense.)\nRevenue decreased $11.9 million from 2017 reflecting income tax changes resulting from the TCJA primarily related to a provision for tax reform refund for the benefit of excess deferred income taxes in 2018. We have recorded the benefit of these excess deferred income taxes for Minnesota Power and SWL&P as regulatory liabilities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nFinancial incentives under the Minnesota conservation improvement program were lower by $2.5 million from 2017 as a result of MPUC-approved modifications to the mechanism for calculating the financial incentives.\nInterim retail rates of $29.5 million collected in 2018 were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Minnesota Power recognized interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million to fully offset interim retail rates collected throughout the year in 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case at a hearing on January 18, 2018.\nRevenue increased $13.5 million from 2017 reflecting higher kWh sales to Residential and Commercial customers, and higher pricing on sales to Other Power Suppliers. Sales to Residential and Commercial customers increased in 2018 primarily due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018 compared to 2017. Sales to Industrial customers decreased 0.9 percent reflecting lower sales to UPM Blandin as a result of the closure of the smaller of its two paper machines in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Husky Energy due to an April 2018 fire at its refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, partially offset by increased taconite production. Revenue from Other Power Suppliers increased due to higher pricing on sales, partially offset by a 2.1 percent decrease in kWh sales from 2017. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through PSAs of various durations.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nKilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quantity\nVariance\n</td> <td>%\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulated Utility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>1,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>7,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal\n</td> <td>798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>10,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Power Suppliers\n</td> <td>3,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Regulated Utility Kilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>14,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and iron concentrate customers accounted for 21 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (22 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (5 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 6 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (7 percent in 2017).\nCost recovery rider revenue increased $13.0 million primarily due to higher expenditures related to the construction of the GNTL and fewer production tax credits recognized by Minnesota Power. If production tax credits are recognized at a level below those assumed in Minnesota Power's base rates, an increase in cost recovery rider revenue is recognized to offset the impact of lower production tax credits on income tax expense.\nFuel adjustment clause recoveries increased $7.9 million due to higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers.\nConservation improvement program recoveries increased $3.5 million from 2017 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses increased $28.9 million, or 3 percent, from 2017.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $10.6 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher purchased power prices and higher fuel costs, partially offset by a $19.5 million expense in 2017 for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nOperating and Maintenance expense decreased $7.2 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to lower salary and benefit expenses, and lower materials purchased for generation facilities, partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in conservation improvement program expenses and additional severance expense of $1.9 million in 2018. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense increased $25.4 million, or 19 percent, from 2017 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell and additional property, plant and equipment in service. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017. Subsequently, as part of the reconsideration of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC reduced the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, resulting in higher depreciation expense in 2018. The increase in depreciation expense in 2018 was offset mostly by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Benefit.)\nInterest Expense increased $3.2 million, or 6 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances, higher interest rates and $0.5 million of interest on Minnesota Power's reserve for interim rate refunds. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC decreased $5.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2017 primarily due to the federal income tax rate change enacted as part of the TCJA, partially offset by additional investments in ATC. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Benefit was $15.5 million in 2018 compared to income tax expense of $27.2 million in 2017. The income tax benefit in 2018 reflects the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income. Income tax expense in 2017 included the impact of a regulatory outcome in 2017 related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations. (See Note 4.

Revenue from capital projects was $33.5 million for 2018 compared to $19.8 million in 2017; capital project sales can significantly fluctuate from period to period. Revenue in 2018 reflected a full year of sales from Tonka Water, which was acquired in September 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE decreased $7.5 million from 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

The decrease from 2017 was primarily due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income in 2018, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA in 2017. The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 28 percent primarily due to production tax credits. (See Note 13.

Interim retail rate refund reserves fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017.\nRevenue increased $29.0 million due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. As a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, operating revenue increased $14.0 million in 2017. In 2016, operating revenue decreased $15.0 million as a result of the adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order. (See Note 4.

(See Operating Expenses - Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility.)\nConservation improvement program recoveries increased $7.2 million from 2016 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.)\nRevenue from kWh sales increased $3.9 million from 2016 primarily due to higher sales to Industrial customers. Sales to Industrial customers increased 13.5 percent primarily due to increased taconite production and the commencement of a long-term PSA with Silver Bay Power in 2016. Sales to Other Power Suppliers decreased 6.4 percent from 2016 as a result of increased sales to Industrial customers. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations; market prices were lower in 2017 compared to 2016. Sales to Residential, Commercial and Municipal customers decreased primarily due to milder temperatures in 2017.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nKilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quantity\nVariance\n</td> <td>%\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulated Utility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>7,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>10,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Power Suppliers\n</td> <td>4,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Regulated Utility Kilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>14,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and iron concentrate customers accounted for 22 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (18 percent in 2016).

Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 7 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (7 percent in 2016).\nInterim retail rates for Minnesota Power were approved by the MPUC and became effective on January 1, 2017. Interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case on January 18, 2018. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nRevenue from wholesale customers under FERC formula-based rates decreased $4.9 million from 2016 primarily due to lower rates.\nFinancial incentives under the conservation improvement program decreased $1.9 million from 2016.\nTransmission revenue decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower MISO-related revenue, partially offset by period over period changes in the estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Operating Expenses - Transmission Services - Utility.)\nOperating Expenses increased $44.5 million, or 5 percent, from 2016.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $57.0 million, or 17 percent, from 2016 primarily due to increased kWh sales, higher fuel costs and a $19.5 million expense for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs at a hearing on January 18, 2018, due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology. These increases were partially offset by lower purchased power prices. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.

(See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14 percent, from 2016 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell, partially offset by additional property, plant and equipment in service. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017.\nTaxes Other than Income Taxes increased $3.4 million, or 7 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher property tax expenses resulting from higher taxable plant.\nInterest Expense increased $4.9 million, or 9 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC increased $4.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2016 primarily due to additional investments in ATC and period over period changes in ATC's estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Expense increased $21.3 million, from 2016 due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits and higher pre-tax income. The TCJA did not have an impact on income tax expense for our Regulated Operations as the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities primarily resulted in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations.\nIn 2016, as a result of the adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order, Regulated Operations reduced operating revenue and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability for $15.0 million resulting in an income tax benefit of $6.2 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax benefit of $8.8 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations.

Net income in 2016 included an after-tax gain of $13.6 million related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability, partially offset by an $8.8 million after-tax adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order.\nNet income at BNI Energy was $4.5 million in 2017 which included a $3.1 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, partially offset by more tons sold; net income in 2016 was $6.8 million. The net loss at ALLETE Properties was $8.8 million in 2017 which included a $7.8 million after-tax expense for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA; net income in 2016 was $0.7 million.\nIncome Taxes - Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was 7.9 percent (11.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016). The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and increased production tax credits, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. (See Regulated Operations - Income Tax Expense.) The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 41 percent primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, and production tax credits. (See Note 13. Income Tax Expense.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions may be revised, which may have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. These policies are discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. We believe the following policies are most critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations.\nRegulatory Accounting. Our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. These standards require us to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in our financial statements. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nPension and Postretirement Health and Life Actuarial Assumptions. We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality assumptions, among others, in determining our obligations and the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefits. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we determine the long-term historical performance of each asset class and adjust these for current economic conditions while utilizing the target allocation of our plan assets to forecast the expected long-term rate of return. Our pension asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 32 percent equity securities, 60 percent fixed income, 5 percent private equity and 3 percent real estate. Our postretirement health and life asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 62 percent equity securities, 34 percent fixed income and 4 percent private equity. Equity securities consist of a mix of market capitalization sizes with domestic and international securities. In 2018, we used expected long-term rates of return of 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension expense and 6.00 percent to 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our other postretirement expense. The actuarial determination uses an asset smoothing methodology for actual returns to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. We review our expected long-term rate of return assumption annually and will adjust it to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.8 million, pre-tax.\nThe discount rate is computed using a bond matching study which utilizes a portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to the projected costs of our pension and other postretirement plans. In 2018, we used discount rates of 3.81 percent to 3.96 percent and 3.86 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. We review our discount rates annually and will adjust them to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.7 million, pre-tax.\nThe mortality assumptions used to calculate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, considered a modified RP-2014 mortality table and mortality projection scale. (See Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets, which include the legacy real estate assets of ALLETE Properties, for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis.\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows are assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the time they are calculated and our expectations related to: management's best estimate of future sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method of disposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations.\nTaxation. We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in our financial statements of the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on audit. Tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criteria are reflected as a tax liability in accordance with the accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes. We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. We make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate our income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. Judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. Our assumptions and judgments include the application of tax statutes and regulations, and projections of future federal taxable income, state taxable income, and state apportionment to determine our ability to utilize NOL and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Significant changes in assumptions regarding future federal and state taxable income or a change in tax rates could require new or increased valuation allowances which could result in a material impact on our results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic and competitive risks. The fair value assigned to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation standards.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value, including projected future cash flows. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Goodwill was $148.5 million and $148.3 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets include customer relationships, patents, non-compete agreements, land easements, trademarks and trade names. Intangible assets with definite lives consist of customer relationships, which are amortized using an attrition model, and patents, non-compete agreements, land easements and certain trade names, which are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from approximately 4 years to approximately 19 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and certain trade names, which are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. Our impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $74.8 million and $77.6 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOutlook\nALLETE is an energy company committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses and sustains growth. The Company has long-term objectives of achieving average annual earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent, and providing a dividend payout competitive with our industry. Regulated Operations is projected to have average annual earnings growth of 4 percent to 5 percent and our Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses are projected to have average annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent over the long-term.\nALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P and an investment in ATC. ALLETE's strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while investing in its Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility's industrial customers and provide potential long-term earnings growth. ALLETE expects net income from Regulated Operations to be approximately 80 percent of total consolidated net income in 2019. Over the next several years, the contribution of the Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to net income is expected to increase as ALLETE grows these operations. ALLETE expects its businesses to provide regulated, contracted or recurring revenues, and to support sustained growth in net income and cash flow.\nOn February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019 upon receipt of regulatory approval. ALLETE plans to use the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services primarily to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE will also consider using a portion of the proceeds to implement a common stock repurchase program.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nRegulated Operations. Minnesota Power's long-term strategy is to be the leading electric energy provider in northeastern Minnesota by providing safe, reliable and cost-competitive electric energy, while complying with environmental permit conditions and renewable energy requirements. Keeping the cost of energy production competitive enables Minnesota Power to effectively compete in the wholesale power markets and minimizes retail rate increases to help maintain customer viability. As part of maintaining cost competitiveness, Minnesota Power intends to reduce its exposure to possible future carbon and GHG legislation by reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal. (See EnergyForward.) We will monitor and review proposed environmental regulations and may challenge those that add considerable cost with limited environmental benefit. Minnesota Power will continue to pursue customer growth opportunities and cost recovery rider approvals for transmission, renewable and environmental investments, as well as work with regulators to earn a fair rate of return. Minnesota Power anticipates filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a 2020 test year.\nRegulatory Matters. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment are under the jurisdiction of the MPUC, FERC, PSCW and NDPSC. See Note 4. Regulatory Matters for discussion of regulatory matters within these jurisdictions.\n2016 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2016, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC which sought an average increase of approximately 9 percent for retail customers. The rate filing sought a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The MPUC issued an order dated March 12, 2018, in Minnesota Power's general rate case approving a return on common equity of 9.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect on December 1, 2018, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $13 million on an annualized basis. Interim rates were collected from January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, which were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve. Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund, net of discounts provided to EITE customers, of $40.0 million as of December 31, 2018 ($23.7 million as of December 31, 2017) which is expected to be refunded in 2019. The MPUC also disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million pre-tax charge to Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility in 2017. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC also extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050 primarily to mitigate rate increases for our customers, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC requesting reconsideration of certain decisions in the MPUC's order dated March 12, 2018. In an order dated May 29, 2018, the MPUC denied Minnesota Power's petition for reconsideration and accepted a Minnesota Department of Commerce request for reconsideration reducing the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035 while utilizing the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA to mitigate the impact on customer rates.\nEnergy-Intensive Trade-Exposed Customer Rates. An EITE customer ratemaking law was enacted in 2015 establishing a Minnesota energy policy to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. The MPUC approved a reduction in rates for EITE customers in a December 2016 order and subsequently approved cost recovery in an April 2017 order. Minnesota Power expects the discount to EITE customers to be approximately $16 million annually based on EITE customer current operating levels. While interim rates were in effect for Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, discounts provided to EITE customers offset interim rate refund reserves for non-EITE customers. Minnesota Power provided $16.7 million of discounts to EITE customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 ($8.6 million and none for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively).\n2016 Wisconsin General Rate Case. SWL&P's retail rates in 2018 were based on a 2017 PSCW retail rate order effective August 2017 that allowed for a 10.5 percent return on common equity and a 55 percent equity ratio. SWL&P's retail rates prior to August 2017 were based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order that provided for a 10.9 percent return on equity.\n2018 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On May 25, 2018, SWL&P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW requesting an average increase of 2.7 percent for retail customers (2.0 percent increase in electric rates; 2.3 percent increase in natural gas rates; and 0.1 percent increase in water rates). The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.5 percent and a 55.41 percent equity ratio. In an order dated December 20, 2018, the PSCW approved a rate increase for SWL&P including a return of equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2019, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $1.3 million on an annualized basis.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load\nIndustrial Customers. Electric power is one of several key inputs in the taconite mining, iron concentrate, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other industries. Approximately 50 percent of our regulated utility kWh sales in 2018 (50 percent in 2017 and 45 percent in 2016) were made to our industrial customers. We expect industrial sales of approximately 7.0 million to 7.5 million MWh in 2019 (7.3 million MWh in 2018; 7.3 million MWh in 2017). (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Electric Sales / Customers.)\nTaconite and Iron Concentrate. Minnesota Power's taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also has provided electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore announced it would no longer seek to restart its operations. (See ERP Iron Ore / Magnetation.)\nThere has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2018 (74 percent in 2017 and 71 percent in 2016). The World Steel Association, an association of over 160 steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2019 will increase by approximately one percent compared to 2018.\nMinnesota Power's taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power's taconite customers' production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.\nUSS Corporation. In the first quarter of 2017, USS Corporation restarted its Minnesota Ore Operations Keetac plant in Keewatin, Minnesota, which had been idled since 2015. USS Corporation has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons at its Keetac Plant.\nUnited Taconite. In May 2017, Cliffs announced that production of a fully fluxed taconite pellet has started at its United Taconite facility. The product replaced a flux pellet previously made at Cliffs' indefinitely idled Empire operation in Michigan. United Taconite has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons of taconite annually.\nNorthshore Mining. Cliffs has announced that it is investing further in its Minnesota ore operations, specifically it plans to invest approximately $90 million through 2020 to expand capacity for producing direct reduced-grade pellets at Northshore Mining. The additional direct reduced-grade pellets could be sold commercially or used to supply Cliff's planned hot briquetted iron production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Minnesota Power has a PSA through 2031 with Silver Bay Power, which provides the majority of the electric service requirements for Northshore Mining. (See Silver Bay Power.)\nSilver Bay Power. In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which has been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Through 2019, Minnesota Power will supply Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power has the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitions away from self-generation. By December 31, 2019, Silver Bay Power is expected to cease self-generation and Minnesota Power is expected to supply the energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load (Continued)\nERP Iron Ore / Magnetation. In January 2017, ERP Iron Ore purchased substantially all of Magnetation's assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement approved by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota and announced that it would no longer seek to restart its operations. Minnesota Power has reserved for all receivables due from ERP Iron Ore.\nPaper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products. The four major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at lower levels in 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from the closure of the smaller of UPM Blandin's two paper machines in the fourth quarter of 2017. (See UPM Blandin.) We expect operating levels in 2019 to be similar to 2018.\nUPM Blandin. In October 2017, UPM-Kymmene Corporation announced that in light of the global market for graphic papers, and to sustain its competitiveness and leading position in the market, it planned to permanently close the smaller of UPM Blandin's two paper machines located in Grand Rapids, Minnesota; the closure was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Paper production related to the other paper machine is planned to continue at UPM Blandin. Minnesota Power provides electric and steam service to UPM Blandin. In October 2018, Minnesota Power amended and extended its electric service agreement with UPM Blandin through 2029, subject to MPUC approval.\nVerso Corporation. In the third quarter of 2018, Minnesota Power amended and extended its electric service agreement with Verso Corporation through 2024, which was approved by the MPUC at a hearing on December 20, 2018.\nPipeline and Other Industries.\nHusky Energy. On April 26, 2018, a fire at Husky Energy's refinery in Superior, Wisconsin disrupted operations at the facility. Under normal operating conditions, SWL&P provides approximately 14 MW of average monthly demand to Husky Energy in addition to water service. The facility remains at minimal operations, and the refinery is not expected to resume normal operations in 2020.\nProspective Additional Load. Minnesota Power is pursuing new wholesale and retail loads in and around its service territory. Currently, several companies in northeastern Minnesota continue to progress in the development of natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for Minnesota Power. We cannot predict the outcome of these projects.\nNashwauk Public Utilities Commission. Mesabi Metallics is a retail customer of the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission, and Minnesota Power has a wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission for electric service through at least December 2032. Mesabi Metallics filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016 under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In June 2017, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement plan for a consortium led by Chippewa Capital Partners LLC to take control of the project, subject to certain stipulations. In December 2017, Mesabi Metallics emerged from bankruptcy under the ownership of Chippewa Capital Partners LLC.\nPolyMet. PolyMet is planning to start a new copper-nickel and precious metal (non-ferrous) mining operation in northeastern Minnesota. In 2015, PolyMet announced the completion of the final EIS by state and federal agencies, which was subsequently published in the Federal Register and Minnesota Environmental Quality Board Monitor. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued its Record of Decision in 2016, finding the final EIS adequate. The final EIS also requires Records of Decision by the federal agencies, which are expected in 2019, before final action can be taken on the required federal permits to construct and operate the mining operation.\nIn 2016, PolyMet submitted applications for water-related permits with the DNR and MPCA, an air quality permit with the MPCA, and a state permit to mine application with the DNR detailing its operational plans for the mine. On November 1, 2018, the DNR issued PolyMet's permit to mine and certain water-related permits. On December 20, 2018, the MPCA issued PolyMet's final state water and air quality permits. PolyMet's remaining federal permit is under review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. On June 28, 2018, the U.S. Forest Service and PolyMet closed on a land exchange, which resulted in PolyMet obtaining surface rights to land needed to develop its mining operation. Minnesota Power could supply between 45 MW and 50 MW of load under a 10-year power supply contract with PolyMet that would begin upon start-up of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nEnergyForward. Minnesota Power is executing EnergyForward, a strategic plan for assuring reliability, protecting affordability and further improving environmental performance. The plan includes completed and planned investments in wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric power, construction of additional transmission capacity, the installation of emissions control technology and the idling of certain coal-fired generating facilities.\nIn July 2017, Minnesota Power submitted a resource package to the MPUC requesting approval of PPAs for the output of a 250 MW wind energy facility and a 10 MW solar energy facility as well as approval of a 250 MW natural gas capacity dedication agreement. These agreements were subject to MPUC approval of the construction of NTEC, a 525 MW to 550 MW combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative and a subsidiary of ALLETE. Minnesota Power would purchase approximately 50 percent of the facility's output starting in 2025. In an order dated January 24, 2019, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power's request for approval of the NTEC natural gas capacity dedication agreement. Separately, the MPUC required a baseload retirement evaluation in Minnesota Power's next IRP filing analyzing its existing fleet including potential early retirement scenarios of Boswell Units 3 and 4, including a securitization plan. The MPUC also approved Minnesota Power's request to extend the next IRP filing deadline until October 1, 2020. On January 8, 2019, an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for NTEC was submitted to the PSCW. A decision on the application is expected in 2020.\nOn June 18, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a separate petition for approval of the PPA for the output of the 10 MW solar energy facility to be located in central Minnesota, which was approved by the MPUC in an order dated October 2, 2018. On August 22, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a separate petition for approval of an amended PPA for the output of the 250 MW wind energy facility to be located in southwestern Minnesota which was approved in an order dated January 23, 2019. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIntegrated Resource Plan. In 2015, Minnesota Power filed its 2015 IRP with the MPUC, which included an analysis of a variety of existing and future energy resource alternatives and a projection of customer cost impact by class. The 2015 IRP also contained steps in Minnesota Power's EnergyForward strategic plan including the economic idling of Taconite Harbor Units 1 and 2 which occurred in 2016, the ceasing of coal-fired operations at Taconite Harbor in 2020, and the addition of between 200 MW and 300 MW of natural gas-fired generation. In a 2016 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power's 2015 IRP with modifications. The order accepted Minnesota Power's plans for Taconite Harbor, directed Minnesota Power to retire Boswell Units 1 and 2 no later than 2022, required an analysis of generation and demand response alternatives to be filed with a natural gas resource proposal, and required Minnesota Power to conduct request for proposals for additional wind, solar and demand response resource additions subject to further MPUC approvals. Minnesota Power retired Boswell Units 1 and 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nRenewable Energy. Minnesota Power's 2015 IRP includes an update on its plans and progress in meeting the Minnesota renewable energy milestones through 2025. Minnesota Power continues to execute its renewable energy strategy through renewable projects that will ensure it meets the identified state mandate at the lowest cost for customers. Minnesota Power has exceeded the interim milestone requirements to date and expects between 25 percent and 30 percent of its applicable retail and municipal energy sales will be supplied by renewable energy sources in 2019. (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Minnesota Legislation and EnergyForward.)\nMinnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota Power's solar energy supply consists of Camp Ripley, a 10 MW solar energy facility at the Camp Ripley Minnesota Army National Guard base and training facility near Little Falls, Minnesota, and a community solar garden project in northeastern Minnesota, which is comprised of a 1 MW solar array owned and operated by a third party with the output purchased by Minnesota Power and a 40 kW solar array that is owned and operated by Minnesota Power. In an order dated October 2, 2018, the MPUC approved a PPA for the output of the 10 MW Blanchard solar energy facility to be located in central Minnesota. Minnesota Power expects that Camp Ripley, the community solar garden arrays, the PPA for the output of the 10 MW Blanchard solar energy facility, and an increase in solar rebates will allow Minnesota Power to meet both parts of the solar mandate. (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Minnesota Legislature and EnergyForward.)\nMinnesota Power has approval for current cost recovery of investments and expenditures related to compliance with the Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. Currently, there is no approved customer billing rate for solar costs.\nWind Energy. Minnesota Power's wind energy facilities consist of Bison (497 MW) located in North Dakota and Taconite Ridge (25 MW) located in northeastern Minnesota. Minnesota Power also has two long-term wind energy PPAs with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc. to purchase the output from Oliver Wind I (50 MW) and Oliver Wind II (48 MW) located in North Dakota.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nEnergyForward (Continued)\nMinnesota Power uses the 465-mile, 250-kV DC transmission line that runs from Center, North Dakota, to Duluth, Minnesota, to transport increasing amounts of wind energy from North Dakota while gradually phasing out coal-based electricity delivered to its system over this transmission line from Square Butte's lignite coal-fired generating unit. The DC transmission line capacity can be increased if renewable energy or transmission needs justify investments to upgrade the line.\nMinnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider for certain renewable investments and expenditures. The cost recovery rider allows Minnesota Power to charge retail customers on a current basis for the costs of certain renewable investments plus a return on the capital invested. Updated customer billing rates for the renewable cost recovery rider were provisionally approved by the MPUC in an order dated November 19, 2018.\nNobles 2 PPA. In the third quarter of 2018, Minnesota Power and Nobles 2 signed an amended long-term PPA that provides for Minnesota Power to purchase the energy and associated capacity from a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota for a 20-year period beginning in 2020. The agreement provides for the purchase of output from the facility at fixed energy prices. There are no fixed capacity charges, and Minnesota Power will only pay for energy as it is delivered. This agreement is subject to construction of the wind energy facility. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nManitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power has five long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. The first PPA expires in May 2020. Under this agreement, Minnesota Power is purchasing 50 MW of capacity and the energy associated with that capacity. Both the capacity price and the energy price are adjusted annually by the change in a governmental inflationary index. Under the second PPA, Minnesota Power is purchasing surplus energy through April 2022. This energy-only agreement primarily consists of surplus hydro energy on Manitoba Hydro's system that is delivered to Minnesota Power on a non-firm basis. The pricing is based on forward market prices. Under this agreement, Minnesota Power will purchase at least one million MWh of energy over the contract term.\nThe third PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro for 15 years beginning in 2020. The PPA is subject to construction of the GNTL and MMTP. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The capacity price is adjusted annually until 2020 by the change in a governmental inflationary index. The energy price is based on a formula that includes an annual fixed price component adjusted for the change in a governmental inflationary index and a natural gas index, as well as market prices.\nThe fourth PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from Manitoba Hydro for 20 years beginning in 2020. The pricing under this PPA is based on forward market prices. The PPA is subject to the construction of the GNTL and MMTP. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nThe fifth PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 50 MW of capacity from Manitoba Hydro at fixed prices. The PPA began in June 2017 and expires in May 2020.\nTransmission. We continue to make investments in transmission opportunities that strengthen or enhance the transmission grid or take advantage of our geographical location between sources of renewable energy and end users. These include the GNTL, investments to enhance our own transmission facilities, investments in other transmission assets (individually or in combination with others), and our investment in ATC. See also Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations and Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.\nEnergy Infrastructure and Related Services.\nALLETE Clean Energy.\nALLETE Clean Energy will pursue growth through acquisitions or project development. ALLETE Clean Energy is targeting acquisitions of existing facilities up to 200 MW each, which have long-term PSAs in place for the facilities' output. At this time, ALLETE Clean Energy expects acquisitions or development of new facilities will be primarily wind or solar facilities in North America. ALLETE Clean Energy is also targeting the development of new facilities up to 200 MW each, which will have long-term PSAs in place for the output or may be sold upon completion. (See Item 1. Business - Energy Infrastructure and Related Services - ALLETE Clean Energy.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy (Continued)\nFederal production tax credit qualification is important to the economics of project development, and in 2016, 2017, and 2018 ALLETE Clean Energy invested in equipment to meet production tax credit safe harbor provisions which provides an opportunity to seek development of up to approximately 1,500 MW of production tax credit qualified wind projects through 2022. ALLETE Clean Energy will also invest approximately $80 million through 2020 for production tax credit requalification of up to 385 WTGs at its Storm Lake I, Storm Lake II and Lake Benton wind energy facilities. On December 18, 2018, ALLETE Clean Energy announced it will requalify its Condon wind energy facility for production tax credits, which will be completed in 2019. We anticipate annual production tax credits relating to these projects of approximately $14 million in 2019, $17 million to $22 million annually in 2020 through 2027, and decreasing thereafter through 2030.\nIn January 2017, ALLETE Clean Energy announced that it would develop a wind energy facility of up to 50 MW to be sold to Montana-Dakota Utilities; sale of the wind energy facility was completed on October 31, 2018, with revenue of $81.1 million and cost of sales of $67.4 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. ALLETE Clean Energy also constructed and sold a 107 MW wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities in 2015.\nIn March 2017, ALLETE Clean Energy announced it will build, own and operate a 100 MW wind energy facility pursuant to a 20-year PSA with Northern States Power; construction is expected to be completed in late 2019. On March 15, 2018, ALLETE Clean Energy announced that it will build, own and operate an 80 MW wind energy facility pursuant to a 15-year PSA with NorthWestern Corporation; construction is expected to be completed in late 2019.\nALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The current portfolio of approximately 545 MW is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. The current mix of PSA expiration and geographic location for existing facilities is as follows:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind Energy Facility\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>Capacity MW\n</td> <td>PSA MW\n</td> <td>PSA Expiration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Armenia Mountain\n</td> <td>Pennsylvania\n</td> <td>100.5\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chanarambie/Viking\n</td> <td>Minnesota\n</td> <td>97.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSA 1 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSA 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88%\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condon\n</td> <td>Oregon\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lake Benton\n</td> <td>Minnesota\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>2028\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lincoln Heights\n</td> <td>Minnesota\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>2028\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm Lake I\n</td> <td>Iowa\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storm Lake II\n</td> <td>Iowa\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSA 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90%\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PSA 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>2032\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The PSA expiration assumes the exercise of four one-year renewal options that ALLETE Clean Energy has the sole right to exercise.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Water Services.\nOn February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital.

On December 27, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE South Wind, entered into a partnership agreement with Tenaska to purchase a 49 percent equity interest in Nobles 2, the entity that will own and operate a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Minnesota Power. The wind energy facility will be built in Nobles County, Minnesota and is expected to be completed in late 2020, with an estimated total project cost of approximately $350 million to $400 million of which our portion is expected to be approximately $170 million to $200 million. We expect to utilize tax equity to finance a portion of our project costs, with an ALLETE expected equity investment of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We account for our investment in Nobles 2 under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2018, our equity investment in Nobles 2 was $33.0 million. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nALLETE Properties. Our strategy incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of the entire ALLETE Properties portfolio. Proceeds from a bulk sale would be strategically deployed to support growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE Properties also continues to pursue sales of individual parcels over time and will continue to maintain key entitlements and infrastructure. Market conditions can impact land sales and could result in our inability to cover our cost basis and operating expenses including fixed carrying costs such as community development district assessments and property taxes.\nIncome Taxes\nALLETE's aggregate federal and multi-state statutory tax rate is approximately 28 percent for 2018. ALLETE also has tax credits and other tax adjustments that reduce the combined statutory rate to the effective tax rate. These tax credits and adjustments historically have included items such as investment tax credits, production tax credits, AFUDC-Equity, depletion, as well as other items. The annual effective rate can also be impacted by such items as changes in income before income taxes, state and federal tax law changes that become effective during the year, business combinations, tax planning initiatives and resolution of prior years' tax matters. We expect our effective tax rate to be a benefit of approximately 10 percent for 2019 primarily due to federal production tax credits as a result of wind energy generation. We also expect that our effective tax rate will be lower than the combined statutory rate over the next 11 years due to production tax credits attributable to our wind energy generation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Position. ALLETE is well-positioned to meet its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.1 million, $388.6 million in available consolidated lines of credit and a debt-to-capital ratio of 41 percent.\nOn February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019 upon receipt of regulatory approval. ALLETE plans to use the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services primarily to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE will also consider using a portion of the proceeds to implement a common stock repurchase program.\nCapital Structure. ALLETE's capital structure for each of the last three years is as follows:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLETE Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,155.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,068.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,893.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt (Including Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year)\n</td> <td>1,495.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>1,513.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>1,569.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,651.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,581.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,462.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCash Flows.

Cash from operating activities was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities in 2018 and the timing of accounts payable, partially offset by lower recoveries from customers under cost recovery riders and higher contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in 2018.\nCash from operating activities was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a payment made in 2016 as part of the PSA between Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power, as well as higher recoveries from customers under cost recovery riders, net income and non-cash items in 2017, partially offset by an increase in customer receivables and timing of payments on accounts payable in 2017.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used for investing activities was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher capital expenditures and additional contributions to equity method investments in 2018. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.) These increases in cash used for investing activities were partially offset by the acquisition of Tonka Water in 2017.\nCash used for investing activities was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2017, partially offset by the acquisition of Tonka Water in 2017. (See Note 6. Acquisitions.)\nFinancing Activities. Cash used for financing activities was higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher dividends on common stock as well as lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long-term debt in 2018, partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2018.\nCash used for financing activities was lower in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long-term debt in 2017, partially offset by higher contingent consideration payments and repayments of long-term debt in 2017.\nWorking Capital. Additional working capital, if and when needed, generally is provided by consolidated bank lines of credit and the issuance of securities, including long-term debt, common stock and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated bank lines of credit aggregating $407.0 million ($407.0 million as of December 31, 2017), most of which expire in January 2024. We had $18.4 million outstanding in standby letters of credit and no outstanding draws under our lines of credit as of December 31, 2018 ($11.9 million in standby letters of credit and no outstanding draws as of December 31, 2017). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had 2.9 million original issue shares of our common stock available for issuance through Invest Direct and 2.9 million original issue shares of common stock available for issuance through a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets, Inc. (See Securities.) The amount and timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market conditions and our specific needs.\nOn January 10, 2019, ALLETE entered into an amended and restated $400 million credit agreement (Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement amended and restated ALLETE's $400 million credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in October 2020. The Credit Agreement is unsecured, has a variable interest rate and will expire in January 2024. (See Note 10. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nSecurities. We entered into a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets, Inc., in 2008, as amended most recently in 2016, with respect to the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 13.6 million shares of our common stock, without par value, of which 2.9 million shares remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no shares of common stock were issued under this agreement (1.0 million shares for net proceeds of $65.7 million in 2017; 0.1 million shares for net proceeds of $8.0 million in 2016). The shares issued in 2017 and 2016 were offered and sold pursuant to Registration Statement No. 333-212794, pursuant to which the remaining shares will continue to be offered for sale, from time to time.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 0.4 million shares of common stock through Invest Direct, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and the Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan, resulting in net proceeds of $20.3 million (0.3 million shares for net proceeds of $20.3 million in 2017; 0.4 million shares for net proceeds of $22.9 million in 2016). These shares of common stock were registered under Registration Statement Nos. 333-211075, 333-183051 and 333-162890. (See Note 10. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt and Note 12. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share for additional detail regarding ALLETE's debt and equity securities.)\nFinancial Covenants. See Note 10. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt for information regarding our financial covenants.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Management considers various factors when making funding decisions, such as regulatory requirements, actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the defined benefit pension plans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $15.0 million in cash and no shares of ALLETE common stock to the defined benefit pension plans. On January 15, 2019, we contributed $10.4 million in cash to the defined benefit pension plans. We do not expect to make any additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2019, and we do not expect to make any contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2019. (See Note 12. Common Stock and Earnings Per Share and Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. ALLETE has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs.

Our long-term debt obligations, including long-term debt due within one year, represent the principal amount of bonds, notes and loans which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus interest. The table above assumes that the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018, remain constant through the remaining term. (See Note 10. Short-Term and Long-Term Debt.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments (Continued)\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations represent our current estimate of future benefit payments through 2028. Pension contributions will be dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, Internal Revenue Service and other regulatory requirements, and contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions for the pension plans. Funding for the other postretirement benefit plans is impacted by realized asset performance, future discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, and utility regulatory requirements. These amounts are estimates and will change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. (See Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nEasement Obligations. Easement obligations represent the minimum payments for our land easement agreements at our wind energy facilities.\nPPA Obligations. PPA obligations represent our Square Butte, Manitoba Hydro, Minnkota Power and other PPAs. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nOther Purchase Obligations. Other purchase obligations represents our minimum purchase commitments under coal and rail contracts, purchase obligations for certain capital expenditure projects, and long-term service agreements for wind energy facilities. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nCredit Ratings. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit and ratings. Our securities have been rated by S&P Global Ratings and by Moody's. Rating agencies use both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company's credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength and future direction. Some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. Our current credit ratings are listed in the following table:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Ratings\n</td> <td>S&P Global Ratings\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuer Credit Rating\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Mortgage Bonds\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Not rated by S&P Global Ratings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOn February 6, 2018, S&P Global Ratings revised its credit rating outlook on ALLETE to negative from stable, while affirming its issuer and commercial paper ratings on ALLETE. S&P Global Ratings cited the potential effect of the TCJA on the Company's cash flows and S&P Global Ratings assessment of the Company's regulatory risk following Minnesota Power's recent general rate case as its rationale for issuing the negative outlook.\nOn February 8, 2018, Moody's issued a report on ALLETE noting that Minnesota Power's general rate case was credit negative. With respect to Minnesota Power's general rate case outcome, Moody's noted a lower return on equity, disallowance of various expenses, including a decision to disallow recovery of the prepaid pension asset, and a ruling against Minnesota Power's request to adopt an annual rate review mechanism. In addition, Moody's noted the potential negative impact of the TCJA on certain financial metrics used by Moody's.\nThe Company believes it is well-positioned to meet its liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.1 million, $388.6 million in available consolidated lines of credit and a debt-to-capital ratio of 41 percent. Our cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $433.1 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had 2.9 million original issue shares of our common stock available for issuance through Invest Direct and 2.9 million original issue shares of common stock available for issuance through a distribution agreement with Lampert Capital Markets, Inc.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommon Stock Dividends. ALLETE is committed to providing a competitive dividend to its shareholders while at the same time funding its growth. ALLETE's long-term objective is to maintain a dividend payout ratio similar to our peers and provide for future dividend increases. Our targeted payout range is between 60 percent and 65 percent. In 2018, we paid out 66 percent (63 percent in 2017; 66 percent in 2016) of our per share earnings in dividends. On January 31, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.5875 per share, which is payable on March 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2019.\nCapital Requirements\nALLETE's projected capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2023 are presented in the following table.

We will finance capital expenditures from a combination of internally generated funds, debt and equity issuance proceeds. We intend to maintain a capital structure with capital ratios near current levels. (See Capital Structure.)\nEnvironmental and Other Matters\nOur businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the past several years. Minnesota Power's facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)\nMarket Risk\nSecurities Investments.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of securities held in other postretirement plans to fund employee benefits. (See Note 8. Investments.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nMarket Risk (Continued)\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt. We manage our interest rate risk by varying the issuance and maturity dates of our fixed rate debt, limiting the amount of variable rate debt, and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.

Based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would impact the amount of pre-tax interest expense by $0.5 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the average variable interest rate on the variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nOur regulated utility operations incur costs for power and fuel (primarily coal and related transportation) in Minnesota, and power and natural gas purchased for resale in our regulated service territory in Wisconsin. Minnesota Power's exposure to price risk for these commodities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which allows recovery of fuel costs in excess of those included in base rates or distribution of savings in fuel costs to ratepayers. SWL&P's exposure to price risk for natural gas is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process and regulatory framework, which allows the commodity cost to be passed through to customers. We seek to prudently manage our customers' exposure to price risk by entering into contracts of various durations and terms for the purchase of power and coal and related transportation costs (Minnesota Power) and natural gas (SWL&P).\nPOWER MARKETING\nMinnesota Power's power marketing activities consist of: (1) purchasing energy in the wholesale market to serve its regulated service territory when energy requirements exceed generation output; and (2) selling excess available energy and purchased power. From time to time, Minnesota Power may have excess energy that is temporarily not required by retail and municipal customers in our regulated service territory. Minnesota Power actively sells any excess energy to the wholesale market to optimize the value of its generating facilities.\nWe are exposed to credit risk primarily through our power marketing activities. We use credit policies to manage credit risk, which includes utilizing an established credit approval process and monitoring counterparty limits.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\nNew accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1.

Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures in this Form 10-K under the headings: Forward-Looking Statements\u201d located on page 6 and Risk Factors\u201d located in Item 1A. The risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer if the risks are realized.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOverview\nBasis of Presentation. We present three reportable segments: Regulated Operations, ALLETE Clean Energy and U.S. Water Services. Our segments were determined in accordance with the guidance on segment reporting. We measure performance of our operations through budgeting and monitoring of contributions to consolidated net income by each business segment.\nRegulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL&P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 145,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 16 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. SWL&P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL&P provides regulated utility electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory authorities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in four states, approximately 545 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation that is contracted under PSAs of various durations. ALLETE Clean Energy also engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion.\nU.S. Water Services provides integrated water management for industry by combining chemical, equipment, engineering and service for customized solutions to reduce water and energy usage, and improve efficiency.\nCorporate and Other is comprised of BNI Energy, our coal mining operations in North Dakota, our investment in Nobles 2, ALLETE Properties, our legacy Florida real estate investment, other business development and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base generation, approximately 4,000 acres of land in Minnesota, and earnings on cash and investments.\nALLETE is incorporated under the laws of Minnesota. Our corporate headquarters are in Duluth, Minnesota. Statistical information is presented as of December 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned unless otherwise specifically indicated.

Net income in 2017 included the favorable impacts of $13.0 million after-tax, or $0.25 per share, for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and $7.9 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share, related to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2017 also included a non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge, or $0.22 per share, for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Earnings per share dilution in 2018 was $0.04 due to additional shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nRegulated Operations net income attributable to ALLETE was $131.0 million in 2018, compared to $128.4 million in 2017. Net income at Minnesota Power was higher than 2017 reflecting the non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge in 2017 for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. Net income in 2018 included lower transmission revenue resulting from lower MISO-related revenue and a $3.1 million after-tax out-of-period adjustment for an estimated true-up of MISO rates that were billed in 2017 and are expected to be credited to customers in 2019, the timing of fuel adjustment clause recoveries, lower industrial sales, and higher property tax and interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expense, higher pricing on PSAs with Other Power Suppliers, increased cost recovery rider revenue, and higher sales to residential and commercial customers due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018. Net income in 2018 also included higher depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, which was offset by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. Net income at SWL&P and our after-tax equity earnings in ATC were similar to 2017.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Financial Overview (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy net income attributable to ALLETE was $33.7 million in 2018 compared to $41.5 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities, a lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA and $7.4 million after-tax of additional production tax credits generated as ALLETE Clean Energy continues to execute its refurbishment strategy. Of the $7.4 million after-tax in additional production tax credits, $3.0 million resulted from the retrospective qualification of additional wind turbine generators in 2016 and 2017. These increases were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses.\nU.S. Water Services net income attributable to ALLETE was $3.2 million in 2018, compared to $10.7 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2018 included $0.6 million of after-tax expense recognized as cost of sales related to purchase accounting for sales backlog.\nCorporate and Other net income attributable to ALLETE was $6.2 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included additional income tax expense of $19.8 million after-tax for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2018 included an increase for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million after-tax as compared to 2017.\n2018 Compared to 2017\n(See Note 17. Business Segments for financial results by segment.)\nRegulated Operations\n\nOperating Revenue - Utility decreased $4.3 million from 2017 primarily due to lower transmission revenue, the impact of a regulatory outcome in 2017 related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, provision for tax reform refund related to income tax changes resulting from the TCJA, and lower financial incentives under the Minnesota conservation improvement program, partially offset by higher revenue from kWh sales, cost recovery rider revenue, fuel clause adjustment recoveries, and conservation improvement program recoveries.\nTransmission revenue decreased $15.0 million primarily due to lower MISO-related revenue and a $4.4 million out-of-period adjustment for an estimated true-up of MISO rates that were billed in 2017 and are expected to be credited to customers in 2019.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nRevenue decreased $14.0 million due to the impact of a regulatory outcome in 2017 related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. This decrease in revenue was offset by the income tax impacts of the regulatory outcome resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Expense.)\nRevenue decreased $11.9 million from 2017 reflecting income tax changes resulting from the TCJA primarily related to a provision for tax reform refund for the benefit of excess deferred income taxes in 2018. We have recorded the benefit of these excess deferred income taxes for Minnesota Power and SWL&P as regulatory liabilities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nFinancial incentives under the Minnesota conservation improvement program were lower by $2.5 million from 2017 as a result of MPUC-approved modifications to the mechanism for calculating the financial incentives.\nInterim retail rates of $29.5 million collected in 2018 were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Minnesota Power recognized interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million to fully offset interim retail rates collected throughout the year in 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case at a hearing on January 18, 2018.\nRevenue increased $13.5 million from 2017 reflecting higher kWh sales to Residential and Commercial customers, and higher pricing on sales to Other Power Suppliers. Sales to Residential and Commercial customers increased in 2018 primarily due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018 compared to 2017. Sales to Industrial customers decreased 0.9 percent reflecting lower sales to UPM Blandin as a result of the closure of the smaller of its two paper machines in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Husky Energy due to an April 2018 fire at its refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, partially offset by increased taconite production. Revenue from Other Power Suppliers increased due to higher pricing on sales, partially offset by a 2.1 percent decrease in kWh sales from 2017. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through PSAs of various durations.\n\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and iron concentrate customers accounted for 21 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (22 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (5 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 6 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (7 percent in 2017).\nCost recovery rider revenue increased $13.0 million primarily due to higher expenditures related to the construction of the GNTL and fewer production tax credits recognized by Minnesota Power. If production tax credits are recognized at a level below those assumed in Minnesota Power's base rates, an increase in cost recovery rider revenue is recognized to offset the impact of lower production tax credits on income tax expense.\nFuel adjustment clause recoveries increased $7.9 million due to higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers.\nConservation improvement program recoveries increased $3.5 million from 2017 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses increased $28.9 million, or 3 percent, from 2017.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $10.6 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher purchased power prices and higher fuel costs, partially offset by a $19.5 million expense in 2017 for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nOperating and Maintenance expense decreased $7.2 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to lower salary and benefit expenses, and lower materials purchased for generation facilities, partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in conservation improvement program expenses and additional severance expense of $1.9 million in 2018. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense increased $25.4 million, or 19 percent, from 2017 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell and additional property, plant and equipment in service. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017. Subsequently, as part of the reconsideration of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC reduced the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, resulting in higher depreciation expense in 2018. The increase in depreciation expense in 2018 was offset mostly by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Benefit.)\nInterest Expense increased $3.2 million, or 6 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances, higher interest rates and $0.5 million of interest on Minnesota Power's reserve for interim rate refunds. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC decreased $5.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2017 primarily due to the federal income tax rate change enacted as part of the TCJA, partially offset by additional investments in ATC. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Benefit was $15.5 million in 2018 compared to income tax expense of $27.2 million in 2017. The income tax benefit in 2018 reflects the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income. Income tax expense in 2017 included the impact of a regulatory outcome in 2017 related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE Clean Energy\n\n (a) Results in 2017 include a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. \nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy (Continued)\nOperating Revenue increased $79.4 million from 2017 due to the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities in 2018.\n\n(a) 2018 included the recognition of $67.4 million of cost of sales related to the sale of a wind energy facility.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE decreased $7.8 million from 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities, a lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA and $7.4 million after-tax of additional production tax credits generated as ALLETE Clean Energy continues to execute its refurbishment strategy. Of the $7.4 million after-tax in additional production tax credits, $3.0 million resulted from the retrospective qualification of additional wind turbine generators in 2016 and 2017. These increases were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses.\nU.S. Water Services\n\n (a) Results in 2017 include a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. \nOperating Revenue increased $20.3 million, or 13 percent, from 2017. Revenue from chemical sales and related services was $138.6 million in 2018 compared to $132.0 million in 2017. Revenue from capital projects was $33.5 million for 2018 compared to $19.8 million in 2017; capital project sales can significantly fluctuate from period to period. Revenue in 2018 reflected a full year of sales from Tonka Water, which was acquired in September 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE decreased $7.5 million from 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2018 included $0.6 million of after-tax expense recognized as cost of sales related to purchase accounting for sales backlog.\nCash flow from operations for U.S. Water Services was approximately $5 million in 2018 compared to approximately $12 million in 2017.\nCorporate and Other\nOperating Revenue decreased $16.1 million, or 13 percent, from 2017 primarily due to a decrease in land sales at ALLETE Properties and lower revenue at BNI Energy, which operates under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, as a result of lower expenses and fewer tons sold in 2018 compared to 2017.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nCorporate and Other (Continued)\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE was $6.2 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included additional income tax expense of $19.8 million after-tax for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2018 included an increase for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million after-tax.\nNet income at BNI Energy was $6.8 million in 2018 compared to $4.5 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $3.1 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. The net loss at ALLETE Properties was $0.5 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.8 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included a $7.8 million after-tax expense for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA.\nIncome Taxes - Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 9.8 percent (expense of 7.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017). The decrease from 2017 was primarily due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income in 2018, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA in 2017. The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 28 percent primarily due to production tax credits. (See Note 13. Income Tax Expense.)\n2017 Compared to 2016\n(See Note 17. Business Segments for financial results by segment.)\nRegulated Operations\n\nOperating Revenue - Utility increased $63.1 million, or 6 percent, from 2016 primarily due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, as well as higher fuel adjustment clause recoveries, conservation improvement program recoveries and revenue from kWh sales, partially offset by lower FERC formula-based rates, financial incentives under the conservation improvement program and transmission revenue. Interim retail rate refund reserves fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017.\nRevenue increased $29.0 million due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. As a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, operating revenue increased $14.0 million in 2017. In 2016, operating revenue decreased $15.0 million as a result of the adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nFuel adjustment clause recoveries increased $24.4 million due to higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers. (See Operating Expenses - Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility.)\nConservation improvement program recoveries increased $7.2 million from 2016 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.)\nRevenue from kWh sales increased $3.9 million from 2016 primarily due to higher sales to Industrial customers. Sales to Industrial customers increased 13.5 percent primarily due to increased taconite production and the commencement of a long-term PSA with Silver Bay Power in 2016. Sales to Other Power Suppliers decreased 6.4 percent from 2016 as a result of increased sales to Industrial customers. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations; market prices were lower in 2017 compared to 2016. Sales to Residential, Commercial and Municipal customers decreased primarily due to milder temperatures in 2017.\n\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and iron concentrate customers accounted for 22 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (18 percent in 2016). Revenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 5 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (6 percent in 2016). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 7 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (7 percent in 2016).\nInterim retail rates for Minnesota Power were approved by the MPUC and became effective on January 1, 2017. Interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case on January 18, 2018. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nRevenue from wholesale customers under FERC formula-based rates decreased $4.9 million from 2016 primarily due to lower rates.\nFinancial incentives under the conservation improvement program decreased $1.9 million from 2016.\nTransmission revenue decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower MISO-related revenue, partially offset by period over period changes in the estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Operating Expenses - Transmission Services - Utility.)\nOperating Expenses increased $44.5 million, or 5 percent, from 2016.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $57.0 million, or 17 percent, from 2016 primarily due to increased kWh sales, higher fuel costs and a $19.5 million expense for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs at a hearing on January 18, 2018, due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology. These increases were partially offset by lower purchased power prices. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nTransmission Services - Utility expense increased $6.0 million, or 9 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher MISO-related expense. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14 percent, from 2016 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell, partially offset by additional property, plant and equipment in service. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017.\nTaxes Other than Income Taxes increased $3.4 million, or 7 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher property tax expenses resulting from higher taxable plant.\nInterest Expense increased $4.9 million, or 9 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC increased $4.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2016 primarily due to additional investments in ATC and period over period changes in ATC's estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Expense increased $21.3 million, from 2016 due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits and higher pre-tax income. The TCJA did not have an impact on income tax expense for our Regulated Operations as the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities primarily resulted in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations.\nIn 2016, as a result of the adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order, Regulated Operations reduced operating revenue and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability for $15.0 million resulting in an income tax benefit of $6.2 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax benefit of $8.8 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax expense of $8.8 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Regulated Operations.\nALLETE Clean Energy\n\n (a) Results in 2017 include a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. \nOperating Revenue is consistent with 2016 as lower kWh sales at the wind energy facilities resulting from lower wind resources were offset by higher amortization of PSAs. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy (Continued)\n\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE increased $28.1 million from 2016. Net income in 2017 included a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, increased production tax credits due to the requalification of WTGs at ALLETE Clean Energy's Storm Lake I, Storm Lake II and Lake Benton wind energy facilities, lower operating and maintenance expense, and lower interest expense compared to 2016. Net income in 2016 included a $3.3 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge and a $0.9 million after-tax expense related to the repayment of long-term debt. Net income in 2016 also included an allocation of earnings to a non-controlling interest in the limited liability company that owns the Condon wind energy facility, which was acquired by ALLETE Clean Energy in April 2016. (See Note 6. Acquisitions.)\nU.S. Water Services\n\n (a) Results in 2017 include a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. \nOperating Revenue increased $14.3 million from 2016 primarily due to the acquisitions of WEST in 2016 and Tonka Water in September 2017. (See Note 6. Acquisitions.) Revenue from chemical sales and related services was $132.0 million in 2017 compared to $124.3 million in 2016. Revenue from capital project sales was $19.8 million for 2017 compared to $13.2 million in 2016; capital project sales can significantly fluctuate from period to period.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE increased $9.2 million from 2016. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, and higher operating revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses as a result of investments for future growth in waste treatment and water safety applications. Net income in 2017 also included a net loss of $0.8 million primarily for transaction fees and amortization expense of the Tonka Water acquisition in September 2017. (See Note 6. Acquisitions.)\nCorporate and Other\nOperating Revenue increased $2.2 million, or 2 percent, from 2016 primarily due to an increase in revenue at BNI Energy, which operates under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, as a result of higher expenses and record coal sales in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in land sales at ALLETE Properties. Operating revenue in 2016 included the sale of ALLETE Properties' Ormond Crossings project and Lake Swamp wetland mitigation bank for approximately $21 million.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nCorporate and Other (Continued)\nNet Loss Attributable to ALLETE was $8.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $4.9 million in 2016. The net loss in 2017 included a $19.8 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. The net loss in 2017 also included a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, lower accretion expense relating to the contingent consideration liability, and lower interest expense. Net income in 2016 included an after-tax gain of $13.6 million related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability, partially offset by an $8.8 million after-tax adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order.\nNet income at BNI Energy was $4.5 million in 2017 which included a $3.1 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, partially offset by more tons sold; net income in 2016 was $6.8 million. The net loss at ALLETE Properties was $8.8 million in 2017 which included a $7.8 million after-tax expense for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA; net income in 2016 was $0.7 million.\nIncome Taxes - Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was 7.9 percent (11.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016). The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and increased production tax credits, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. (See Regulated Operations - Income Tax Expense.) The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 41 percent primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, and production tax credits. (See Note 13. Income Tax Expense.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions may be revised, which may have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. These policies are discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. We believe the following policies are most critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations.\nRegulatory Accounting. Our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. These standards require us to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in our financial statements. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. (See Note 4.

We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality assumptions, among others, in determining our obligations and the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefits. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we determine the long-term historical performance of each asset class and adjust these for current economic conditions while utilizing the target allocation of our plan assets to forecast the expected long-term rate of return. Our pension asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 32 percent equity securities, 60 percent fixed income, 5 percent private equity and 3 percent real estate. Our postretirement health and life asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 62 percent equity securities, 34 percent fixed income and 4 percent private equity. Equity securities consist of a mix of market capitalization sizes with domestic and international securities. In 2018, we used expected long-term rates of return of 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension expense and 6.00 percent to 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our other postretirement expense. The actuarial determination uses an asset smoothing methodology for actual returns to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. We review our expected long-term rate of return assumption annually and will adjust it to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.8 million, pre-tax.\nThe discount rate is computed using a bond matching study which utilizes a portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to the projected costs of our pension and other postretirement plans. In 2018, we used discount rates of 3.81 percent to 3.96 percent and 3.86 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. We review our discount rates annually and will adjust them to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.7 million, pre-tax.\nThe mortality assumptions used to calculate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, considered a modified RP-2014 mortality table and mortality projection scale. (See Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets, which include the legacy real estate assets of ALLETE Properties, for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis.\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows are assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the time they are calculated and our expectations related to: management's best estimate of future sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method of disposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations.\nTaxation. We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in our financial statements of the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on audit. Tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criteria are reflected as a tax liability in accordance with the accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes. We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. We make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate our income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. Judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. Our assumptions and judgments include the application of tax statutes and regulations, and projections of future federal taxable income, state taxable income, and state apportionment to determine our ability to utilize NOL and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Significant changes in assumptions regarding future federal and state taxable income or a change in tax rates could require new or increased valuation allowances which could result in a material impact on our results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic and competitive risks. The fair value assigned to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation standards.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value, including projected future cash flows. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Goodwill was $148.5 million and $148.3 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets include customer relationships, patents, non-compete agreements, land easements, trademarks and trade names. Intangible assets with definite lives consist of customer relationships, which are amortized using an attrition model, and patents, non-compete agreements, land easements and certain trade names, which are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from approximately 4 years to approximately 19 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and certain trade names, which are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. Our impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $74.8 million and $77.6 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOutlook\nALLETE is an energy company committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses and sustains growth. The Company has long-term objectives of achieving average annual earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent, and providing a dividend payout competitive with our industry. Regulated Operations is projected to have average annual earnings growth of 4 percent to 5 percent and our Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses are projected to have average annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent over the long-term.\nALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P and an investment in ATC. ALLETE's strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while investing in its Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility's industrial customers and provide potential long-term earnings growth. ALLETE expects net income from Regulated Operations to be approximately 80 percent of total consolidated net income in 2019. Over the next several years, the contribution of the Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to net income is expected to increase as ALLETE grows these operations. ALLETE expects its businesses to provide regulated, contracted or recurring revenues, and to support sustained growth in net income and cash flow.\nOn February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019 upon receipt of regulatory approval. ALLETE plans to use the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services primarily to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE will also consider using a portion of the proceeds to implement a common stock repurchase program.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nRegulated Operations. Minnesota Power's long-term strategy is to be the leading electric energy provider in northeastern Minnesota by providing safe, reliable and cost-competitive electric energy, while complying with environmental permit conditions and renewable energy requirements. Keeping the cost of energy production competitive enables Minnesota Power to effectively compete in the wholesale power markets and minimizes retail rate increases to help maintain customer viability. As part of maintaining cost competitiveness, Minnesota Power intends to reduce its exposure to possible future carbon and GHG legislation by reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal. (See EnergyForward.) We will monitor and review proposed environmental regulations and may challenge those that add considerable cost with limited environmental benefit. Minnesota Power will continue to pursue customer growth opportunities and cost recovery rider approvals for transmission, renewable and environmental investments, as well as work with regulators to earn a fair rate of return. Minnesota Power anticipates filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a 2020 test year.\nRegulatory Matters. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment are under the jurisdiction of the MPUC, FERC, PSCW and NDPSC. See Note 4. Regulatory Matters for discussion of regulatory matters within these jurisdictions.\n2016 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2016, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC which sought an average increase of approximately 9 percent for retail customers. The rate filing sought a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The MPUC issued an order dated March 12, 2018, in Minnesota Power's general rate case approving a return on common equity of 9.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect on December 1, 2018, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $13 million on an annualized basis. Interim rates were collected from January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, which were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve. Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund, net of discounts provided to EITE customers, of $40.0 million as of December 31, 2018 ($23.7 million as of December 31, 2017) which is expected to be refunded in 2019. The MPUC also disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million pre-tax charge to Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility in 2017. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC also extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050 primarily to mitigate rate increases for our customers, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC requesting reconsideration of certain decisions in the MPUC's order dated March 12, 2018. In an order dated May 29, 2018, the MPUC denied Minnesota Power's petition for reconsideration and accepted a Minnesota Department of Commerce request for reconsideration reducing the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035 while utilizing the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA to mitigate the impact on customer rates.\nEnergy-Intensive Trade-Exposed Customer Rates. An EITE customer ratemaking law was enacted in 2015 establishing a Minnesota energy policy to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. The MPUC approved a reduction in rates for EITE customers in a December 2016 order and subsequently approved cost recovery in an April 2017 order. Minnesota Power expects the discount to EITE customers to be approximately $16 million annually based on EITE customer current operating levels. While interim rates were in effect for Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, discounts provided to EITE customers offset interim rate refund reserves for non-EITE customers. Minnesota Power provided $16.7 million of discounts to EITE customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 ($8.6 million and none for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively).\n2016 Wisconsin General Rate Case. SWL&P's retail rates in 2018 were based on a 2017 PSCW retail rate order effective August 2017 that allowed for a 10.5 percent return on common equity and a 55 percent equity ratio. SWL&P's retail rates prior to August 2017 were based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order that provided for a 10.9 percent return on equity.\n2018 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On May 25, 2018, SWL&P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW requesting an average increase of 2.7 percent for retail customers (2.0 percent increase in electric rates; 2.3 percent increase in natural gas rates; and 0.1 percent increase in water rates). The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.5 percent and a 55.41 percent equity ratio. In an order dated December 20, 2018, the PSCW approved a rate increase for SWL&P including a return of equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2019, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $1.3 million on an annualized basis.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load\nIndustrial Customers. Electric power is one of several key inputs in the taconite mining, iron concentrate, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other industries. Approximately 50 percent of our regulated utility kWh sales in 2018 (50 percent in 2017 and 45 percent in 2016) were made to our industrial customers. We expect industrial sales of approximately 7.0 million to 7.5 million MWh in 2019 (7.3 million MWh in 2018; 7.3 million MWh in 2017). (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Electric Sales / Customers.)\nTaconite and Iron Concentrate. Minnesota Power's taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also has provided electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore announced it would no longer seek to restart its operations. (See ERP Iron Ore / Magnetation.)\nThere has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2018 (74 percent in 2017 and 71 percent in 2016). The World Steel Association, an association of over 160 steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2019 will increase by approximately one percent compared to 2018.\nMinnesota Power's taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power's taconite customers' production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.\nUSS Corporation. In the first quarter of 2017, USS Corporation restarted its Minnesota Ore Operations Keetac plant in Keewatin, Minnesota, which had been idled since 2015. USS Corporation has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons at its Keetac Plant.\nUnited Taconite. In May 2017, Cliffs announced that production of a fully fluxed taconite pellet has started at its United Taconite facility. The product replaced a flux pellet previously made at Cliffs' indefinitely idled Empire operation in Michigan. United Taconite has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons of taconite annually.\nNorthshore Mining. Cliffs has announced that it is investing further in its Minnesota ore operations, specifically it plans to invest approximately $90 million through 2020 to expand capacity for producing direct reduced-grade pellets at Northshore Mining. The additional direct reduced-grade pellets could be sold commercially or used to supply Cliff's planned hot briquetted iron production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Minnesota Power has a PSA through 2031 with Silver Bay Power, which provides the majority of the electric service requirements for Northshore Mining. (See Silver Bay Power.)\nSilver Bay Power. In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which has been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Through 2019, Minnesota Power will supply Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power has the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitions away from self-generation. By December 31, 2019, Silver Bay Power is expected to cease self-generation and Minnesota Power is expected to supply the energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load (Continued)\nERP Iron Ore / Magnetation. In January 2017, ERP Iron Ore purchased substantially all of Magnetation's assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement approved by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota and announced that it would no longer seek to restart its operations. Minnesota Power has reserved for all receivables due from ERP Iron Ore.\nPaper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products. The four major paper and pulp mills",

Net income in 2017 included the favorable impacts of $13.0 million after-tax, or $0.25 per share, for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and $7.9 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share, related to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2017 also included a non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge, or $0.22 per share, for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.) Earnings per share dilution in 2018 was $0.04 due to additional shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nRegulated Operations net income attributable to ALLETE was $131.0 million in 2018, compared to $128.4 million in 2017. Net income at Minnesota Power was higher than 2017 reflecting the non-cash $11.4 million after-tax charge in 2017 for the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. Net income in 2018 included lower transmission revenue resulting from lower MISO-related revenue and a $3.1 million after-tax out-of-period adjustment for an estimated true-up of MISO rates that were billed in 2017 and are expected to be credited to customers in 2019, the timing of fuel adjustment clause recoveries, lower industrial sales, and higher property tax and interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expense, higher pricing on PSAs with Other Power Suppliers, increased cost recovery rider revenue, and higher sales to residential and commercial customers due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018. Net income in 2018 also included higher depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, which was offset by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. Net income at SWL&P and our after-tax equity earnings in ATC were similar to 2017.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Financial Overview (Continued)\nALLETE Clean Energy net income attributable to ALLETE was $33.7 million in 2018 compared to $41.5 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included the sale of a wind energy facility to Montana-Dakota Utilities, a lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA and $7.4 million after-tax of additional production tax credits generated as ALLETE Clean Energy continues to execute its refurbishment strategy. Of the $7.4 million after-tax in additional production tax credits, $3.0 million resulted from the retrospective qualification of additional wind turbine generators in 2016 and 2017. These increases were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses.\nU.S. Water Services net income attributable to ALLETE was $3.2 million in 2018, compared to $10.7 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2018 included $0.6 million of after-tax expense recognized as cost of sales related to purchase accounting for sales backlog.\nCorporate and Other net income attributable to ALLETE was $6.2 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included additional income tax expense of $19.8 million after-tax for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2018 included an increase for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million after-tax as compared to 2017.\n2018 Compared to 2017\n(See Note 17.

Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Expense.)\nRevenue decreased $11.9 million from 2017 reflecting income tax changes resulting from the TCJA primarily related to a provision for tax reform refund for the benefit of excess deferred income taxes in 2018. We have recorded the benefit of these excess deferred income taxes for Minnesota Power and SWL&P as regulatory liabilities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nFinancial incentives under the Minnesota conservation improvement program were lower by $2.5 million from 2017 as a result of MPUC-approved modifications to the mechanism for calculating the financial incentives.\nInterim retail rates of $29.5 million collected in 2018 were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Minnesota Power recognized interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million to fully offset interim retail rates collected throughout the year in 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case at a hearing on January 18, 2018.\nRevenue increased $13.5 million from 2017 reflecting higher kWh sales to Residential and Commercial customers, and higher pricing on sales to Other Power Suppliers. Sales to Residential and Commercial customers increased in 2018 primarily due to more favorable weather conditions in 2018 compared to 2017. Sales to Industrial customers decreased 0.9 percent reflecting lower sales to UPM Blandin as a result of the closure of the smaller of its two paper machines in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Husky Energy due to an April 2018 fire at its refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, partially offset by increased taconite production. Revenue from Other Power Suppliers increased due to higher pricing on sales, partially offset by a 2.1 percent decrease in kWh sales from 2017. Sales to Other Power Suppliers are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through PSAs of various durations.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nKilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Quantity\nVariance\n</td> <td>%\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulated Utility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>1,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>1,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>7,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal\n</td> <td>798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Retail and Municipal\n</td> <td>10,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Power Suppliers\n</td> <td>3,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Regulated Utility Kilowatt-hours Sold\n</td> <td>14,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from electric sales to taconite and iron concentrate customers accounted for 21 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (22 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to paper, pulp and secondary wood product customers accounted for 4 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (5 percent in 2017). Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 6 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2018 (7 percent in 2017).\nCost recovery rider revenue increased $13.0 million primarily due to higher expenditures related to the construction of the GNTL and fewer production tax credits recognized by Minnesota Power. If production tax credits are recognized at a level below those assumed in Minnesota Power's base rates, an increase in cost recovery rider revenue is recognized to offset the impact of lower production tax credits on income tax expense.\nFuel adjustment clause recoveries increased $7.9 million due to higher fuel and purchased power costs attributable to retail and municipal customers.\nConservation improvement program recoveries increased $3.5 million from 2017 primarily due to an increase in related expenditures. (See Operating Expenses - Operating and Maintenance.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nOperating Expenses increased $28.9 million, or 3 percent, from 2017.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $10.6 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher purchased power prices and higher fuel costs, partially offset by a $19.5 million expense in 2017 for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nOperating and Maintenance expense decreased $7.2 million, or 3 percent, from 2017 primarily due to lower salary and benefit expenses, and lower materials purchased for generation facilities, partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in conservation improvement program expenses and additional severance expense of $1.9 million in 2018. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense increased $25.4 million, or 19 percent, from 2017 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell and additional property, plant and equipment in service. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017. Subsequently, as part of the reconsideration of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC reduced the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035, resulting in higher depreciation expense in 2018. The increase in depreciation expense in 2018 was offset mostly by the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters and Income Tax Benefit.)\nInterest Expense increased $3.2 million, or 6 percent, from 2017 primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances, higher interest rates and $0.5 million of interest on Minnesota Power's reserve for interim rate refunds. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC decreased $5.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2017 primarily due to the federal income tax rate change enacted as part of the TCJA, partially offset by additional investments in ATC. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Benefit was $15.5 million in 2018 compared to income tax expense of $27.2 million in 2017. The income tax benefit in 2018 reflects the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income. Income tax expense in 2017 included the impact of a regulatory outcome in 2017 related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations. (See Note 4.

Revenue from capital projects was $33.5 million for 2018 compared to $19.8 million in 2017; capital project sales can significantly fluctuate from period to period. Revenue in 2018 reflected a full year of sales from Tonka Water, which was acquired in September 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE decreased $7.5 million from 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. Net income in 2018 included increased revenue primarily due to higher capital project sales and higher sales of chemicals and related services, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in 2018 included $0.6 million of after-tax expense recognized as cost of sales related to purchase accounting for sales backlog.\nCash flow from operations for U.S. Water Services was approximately $5 million in 2018 compared to approximately $12 million in 2017.\nCorporate and Other\nOperating Revenue decreased $16.1 million, or 13 percent, from 2017 primarily due to a decrease in land sales at ALLETE Properties and lower revenue at BNI Energy, which operates under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, as a result of lower expenses and fewer tons sold in 2018 compared to 2017.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2018 Compared to 2017 (Continued)\nCorporate and Other (Continued)\nNet Income Attributable to ALLETE was $6.2 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included additional income tax expense of $19.8 million after-tax for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its November 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. Net income in 2018 included an increase for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $1.3 million after-tax.\nNet income at BNI Energy was $6.8 million in 2018 compared to $4.5 million in 2017. Net income in 2017 included a $3.1 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. The net loss at ALLETE Properties was $0.5 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.8 million in 2017. The net loss in 2017 included a $7.8 million after-tax expense for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA.\nIncome Taxes - Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 9.8 percent (expense of 7.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017). The decrease from 2017 was primarily due to the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of the TCJA, the amortization of excess deferred income tax benefit resulting from the TCJA and lower pre-tax income in 2018, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA in 2017. The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 28 percent primarily due to production tax credits. (See Note 13.

Interim retail rate refund reserves fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017.\nRevenue increased $29.0 million due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits. As a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, operating revenue increased $14.0 million in 2017.

Revenue from electric sales to pipelines and other industrial customers accounted for 7 percent of consolidated operating revenue in 2017 (7 percent in 2016).\nInterim retail rates for Minnesota Power were approved by the MPUC and became effective on January 1, 2017. Interim retail rate refund reserves of $31.6 million fully offset the interim retail rates recognized during 2017 due to the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case on January 18, 2018. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nRevenue from wholesale customers under FERC formula-based rates decreased $4.9 million from 2016 primarily due to lower rates.\nFinancial incentives under the conservation improvement program decreased $1.9 million from 2016.\nTransmission revenue decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower MISO-related revenue, partially offset by period over period changes in the estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Operating Expenses - Transmission Services - Utility.)\nOperating Expenses increased $44.5 million, or 5 percent, from 2016.\nFuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility expense increased $57.0 million, or 17 percent, from 2016 primarily due to increased kWh sales, higher fuel costs and a $19.5 million expense for the MPUC's decision disallowing recovery of Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs at a hearing on January 18, 2018, due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology. These increases were partially offset by lower purchased power prices. Fuel and purchased power expense related to our retail and municipal customers is recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nRegulated Operations (Continued)\nTransmission Services - Utility expense increased $6.0 million, or 9 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher MISO-related expense. (See Operating Revenue - Utility.)\nDepreciation and Amortization expense decreased $21.7 million, or 14 percent, from 2016 primarily due to modifications of the depreciable lives for Boswell, partially offset by additional property, plant and equipment in service. At a hearing on January 18, 2018, the MPUC extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in 2017.\nTaxes Other than Income Taxes increased $3.4 million, or 7 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher property tax expenses resulting from higher taxable plant.\nInterest Expense increased $4.9 million, or 9 percent, from 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. We record interest expense for Regulated Operations primarily based on rate base and authorized capital structure, and allocate the balance to Corporate and Other.\nEquity Earnings in ATC increased $4.0 million, or 22 percent, from 2016 primarily due to additional investments in ATC and period over period changes in ATC's estimate of a refund liability related to MISO return on equity complaints. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)\nIncome Tax Expense increased $21.3 million, from 2016 due to the period over period impact of the regulatory outcomes related to the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits and higher pre-tax income. The TCJA did not have an impact on income tax expense for our Regulated Operations as the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities primarily resulted in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.\nIn 2017, as a result of the favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, Regulated Operations increased operating revenue and reduced the corresponding regulatory liability by $14.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $6.1 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax expense of $7.9 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax benefit of $7.9 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Regulated Operations.\nIn 2016, as a result of the adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order, Regulated Operations reduced operating revenue and recorded a corresponding regulatory liability for $15.0 million resulting in an income tax benefit of $6.2 million. In addition, Regulated Operations recorded an income tax benefit of $8.8 million for North Dakota investment tax credits transferred from Corporate and Other, resulting in no impact to net income for Regulated Operations. Corporate and Other recorded an offsetting income tax expense of $8.8 million for the North Dakota investment tax credits transferred to Regulated Operations.\nALLETE Clean Energy\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$80.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$80.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Attributable to ALLETE (a)\n</td> <td>$41.5\n</td> <td>$13.4\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Results in 2017 include a $23.6 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. \nOperating Revenue is consistent with 2016 as lower kWh sales at the wind energy facilities resulting from lower wind resources were offset by higher amortization of PSAs.

Net income in 2017 included a $9.2 million after-tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, and higher operating revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses as a result of investments for future growth in waste treatment and water safety applications. Net income in 2017 also included a net loss of $0.8 million primarily for transaction fees and amortization expense of the Tonka Water acquisition in September 2017. (See Note 6.

Operating revenue in 2016 included the sale of ALLETE Properties' Ormond Crossings project and Lake Swamp wetland mitigation bank for approximately $21 million.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\n2017 Compared to 2016 (Continued)\nCorporate and Other (Continued)\nNet Loss Attributable to ALLETE was $8.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $4.9 million in 2016. The net loss in 2017 included a $19.8 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA. The net loss in 2017 also included a $7.9 million after-tax favorable impact for the regulatory outcome of the MPUC's modification of its 2016 order on the allocation of North Dakota investment tax credits, lower accretion expense relating to the contingent consideration liability, and lower interest expense. Net income in 2016 included an after-tax gain of $13.6 million related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability, partially offset by an $8.8 million after-tax adverse impact for the regulatory outcome of the 2016 MPUC order.\nNet income at BNI Energy was $4.5 million in 2017 which included a $3.1 million after-tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, partially offset by more tons sold; net income in 2016 was $6.8 million. The net loss at ALLETE Properties was $8.8 million in 2017 which included a $7.8 million after-tax expense for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA; net income in 2016 was $0.7 million.\nIncome Taxes - Consolidated\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was 7.9 percent (11.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016). The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA and increased production tax credits, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. (See Regulated Operations - Income Tax Expense.) The effective rate deviated from the combined statutory rate of approximately 41 percent primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulting from the TCJA, and production tax credits. (See Note 13. Income Tax Expense.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions may be revised, which may have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. These policies are discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. We believe the following policies are most critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations.\nRegulatory Accounting. Our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for the effects of certain types of regulation. These standards require us to reflect the effect of regulatory decisions in our financial statements. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable for recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. The Company assesses quarterly whether regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment and recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction. If future recovery or refund of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized in current period net income or other comprehensive income. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nPension and Postretirement Health and Life Actuarial Assumptions. We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and mortality assumptions, among others, in determining our obligations and the annual cost of our pension and other postretirement benefits. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we determine the long-term historical performance of each asset class and adjust these for current economic conditions while utilizing the target allocation of our plan assets to forecast the expected long-term rate of return. Our pension asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 32 percent equity securities, 60 percent fixed income, 5 percent private equity and 3 percent real estate. Our postretirement health and life asset allocation as of December 31, 2018, was approximately 62 percent equity securities, 34 percent fixed income and 4 percent private equity. Equity securities consist of a mix of market capitalization sizes with domestic and international securities. In 2018, we used expected long-term rates of return of 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension expense and 6.00 percent to 7.50 percent in our actuarial determination of our other postretirement expense. The actuarial determination uses an asset smoothing methodology for actual returns to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. We review our expected long-term rate of return assumption annually and will adjust it to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.8 million, pre-tax.\nThe discount rate is computed using a bond matching study which utilizes a portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows similar to the projected costs of our pension and other postretirement plans. In 2018, we used discount rates of 3.81 percent to 3.96 percent and 3.86 percent in our actuarial determination of our pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. We review our discount rates annually and will adjust them to respond to changing market conditions. A one-quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the annual expense for pension and other postretirement benefits by approximately $1.7 million, pre-tax.\nThe mortality assumptions used to calculate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, considered a modified RP-2014 mortality table and mortality projection scale. (See Note 15. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.)\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review our long-lived assets, which include the legacy real estate assets of ALLETE Properties, for indicators of impairment in accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment on a quarterly basis.\nIn accordance with the accounting standards for property, plant and equipment, if indicators of impairment exist, we test our long-lived assets for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Cash flows are assessed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The undiscounted future net cash flows are impacted by trends and factors known to us at the time they are calculated and our expectations related to: management's best estimate of future sales prices; holding period and timing of sales; method of disposition; and future expenditures necessary to maintain the operations.\nTaxation. We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income taxes and taxes other than income taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in our financial statements of the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on audit. Tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criteria are reflected as a tax liability in accordance with the accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes. We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. We make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate our income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. Judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. Our assumptions and judgments include the application of tax statutes and regulations, and projections of future federal taxable income, state taxable income, and state apportionment to determine our ability to utilize NOL and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Significant changes in assumptions regarding future federal and state taxable income or a change in tax rates could require new or increased valuation allowances which could result in a material impact on our results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Policies (Continued)\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic and competitive risks. The fair value assigned to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation standards.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value, including projected future cash flows. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Goodwill was $148.5 million and $148.3 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets include customer relationships, patents, non-compete agreements, land easements, trademarks and trade names. Intangible assets with definite lives consist of customer relationships, which are amortized using an attrition model, and patents, non-compete agreements, land easements and certain trade names, which are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from approximately 4 years to approximately 19 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and certain trade names, which are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value. Our impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. The results of our annual impairment test are discussed in Note 9. Fair Value in this Form 10-K. Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $74.8 million and $77.6 million as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOutlook\nALLETE is an energy company committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses and sustains growth. The Company has long-term objectives of achieving average annual earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 7 percent, and providing a dividend payout competitive with our industry. Regulated Operations is projected to have average annual earnings growth of 4 percent to 5 percent and our Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses are projected to have average annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent over the long-term.\nALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P and an investment in ATC. ALLETE's strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while investing in its Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility's industrial customers and provide potential long-term earnings growth. ALLETE expects net income from Regulated Operations to be approximately 80 percent of total consolidated net income in 2019. Over the next several years, the contribution of the Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses to net income is expected to increase as ALLETE grows these operations. ALLETE expects its businesses to provide regulated, contracted or recurring revenues, and to support sustained growth in net income and cash flow.\nOn February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019 upon receipt of regulatory approval. ALLETE plans to use the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services primarily to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE will also consider using a portion of the proceeds to implement a common stock repurchase program.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nRegulated Operations. Minnesota Power's long-term strategy is to be the leading electric energy provider in northeastern Minnesota by providing safe, reliable and cost-competitive electric energy, while complying with environmental permit conditions and renewable energy requirements. Keeping the cost of energy production competitive enables Minnesota Power to effectively compete in the wholesale power markets and minimizes retail rate increases to help maintain customer viability. As part of maintaining cost competitiveness, Minnesota Power intends to reduce its exposure to possible future carbon and GHG legislation by reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal. (See EnergyForward.) We will monitor and review proposed environmental regulations and may challenge those that add considerable cost with limited environmental benefit. Minnesota Power will continue to pursue customer growth opportunities and cost recovery rider approvals for transmission, renewable and environmental investments, as well as work with regulators to earn a fair rate of return. Minnesota Power anticipates filing a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a 2020 test year.\nRegulatory Matters. Entities within our Regulated Operations segment are under the jurisdiction of the MPUC, FERC, PSCW and NDPSC. See Note 4. Regulatory Matters for discussion of regulatory matters within these jurisdictions.\n2016 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2016, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC which sought an average increase of approximately 9 percent for retail customers. The rate filing sought a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The MPUC issued an order dated March 12, 2018, in Minnesota Power's general rate case approving a return on common equity of 9.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect on December 1, 2018, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $13 million on an annualized basis. Interim rates were collected from January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, which were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve. Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund, net of discounts provided to EITE customers, of $40.0 million as of December 31, 2018 ($23.7 million as of December 31, 2017) which is expected to be refunded in 2019. The MPUC also disallowed Minnesota Power's regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million pre-tax charge to Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas - Utility in 2017. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, the MPUC also extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050 primarily to mitigate rate increases for our customers, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn April 2, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC requesting reconsideration of certain decisions in the MPUC's order dated March 12, 2018. In an order dated May 29, 2018, the MPUC denied Minnesota Power's petition for reconsideration and accepted a Minnesota Department of Commerce request for reconsideration reducing the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035 while utilizing the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA to mitigate the impact on customer rates.\nEnergy-Intensive Trade-Exposed Customer Rates. An EITE customer ratemaking law was enacted in 2015 establishing a Minnesota energy policy to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. The MPUC approved a reduction in rates for EITE customers in a December 2016 order and subsequently approved cost recovery in an April 2017 order. Minnesota Power expects the discount to EITE customers to be approximately $16 million annually based on EITE customer current operating levels. While interim rates were in effect for Minnesota Power's 2016 general rate case, discounts provided to EITE customers offset interim rate refund reserves for non-EITE customers. Minnesota Power provided $16.7 million of discounts to EITE customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 ($8.6 million and none for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively).\n2016 Wisconsin General Rate Case. SWL&P's retail rates in 2018 were based on a 2017 PSCW retail rate order effective August 2017 that allowed for a 10.5 percent return on common equity and a 55 percent equity ratio. SWL&P's retail rates prior to August 2017 were based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order that provided for a 10.9 percent return on equity.\n2018 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On May 25, 2018, SWL&P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW requesting an average increase of 2.7 percent for retail customers (2.0 percent increase in electric rates; 2.3 percent increase in natural gas rates; and 0.1 percent increase in water rates). The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.5 percent and a 55.41 percent equity ratio. In an order dated December 20, 2018, the PSCW approved a rate increase for SWL&P including a return of equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2019, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $1.3 million on an annualized basis.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load\nIndustrial Customers. Electric power is one of several key inputs in the taconite mining, iron concentrate, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, pipeline and other industries. Approximately 50 percent of our regulated utility kWh sales in 2018 (50 percent in 2017 and 45 percent in 2016) were made to our industrial customers. We expect industrial sales of approximately 7.0 million to 7.5 million MWh in 2019 (7.3 million MWh in 2018; 7.3 million MWh in 2017). (See Item 1. Business - Regulated Operations - Electric Sales / Customers.)\nTaconite and Iron Concentrate. Minnesota Power's taconite customers are capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also has provided electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore announced it would no longer seek to restart its operations. (See ERP Iron Ore / Magnetation.)\nThere has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2018 (74 percent in 2017 and 71 percent in 2016). The World Steel Association, an association of over 160 steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2019 will increase by approximately one percent compared to 2018.\nMinnesota Power's taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power's taconite customers' production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.\nUSS Corporation. In the first quarter of 2017, USS Corporation restarted its Minnesota Ore Operations Keetac plant in Keewatin, Minnesota, which had been idled since 2015. USS Corporation has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons at its Keetac Plant.\nUnited Taconite. In May 2017, Cliffs announced that production of a fully fluxed taconite pellet has started at its United Taconite facility. The product replaced a flux pellet previously made at Cliffs' indefinitely idled Empire operation in Michigan. United Taconite has the capability to produce approximately 5 million tons of taconite annually.\nNorthshore Mining. Cliffs has announced that it is investing further in its Minnesota ore operations, specifically it plans to invest approximately $90 million through 2020 to expand capacity for producing direct reduced-grade pellets at Northshore Mining. The additional direct reduced-grade pellets could be sold commercially or used to supply Cliff's planned hot briquetted iron production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Minnesota Power has a PSA through 2031 with Silver Bay Power, which provides the majority of the electric service requirements for Northshore Mining. (See Silver Bay Power.)\nSilver Bay Power. In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which has been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Through 2019, Minnesota Power will supply Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power has the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitions away from self-generation. By December 31, 2019, Silver Bay Power is expected to cease self-generation and Minnesota Power is expected to supply the energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.\nALLETE, Inc. 2018 Form 10-K\nOutlook (Continued)\nIndustrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load (Continued)\nERP Iron Ore / Magnetation. In January 2017, ERP Iron Ore purchased substantially all of Magnetation's assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement approved by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota and announced that it would no longer seek to restart its operations. Minnesota Power has reserved for all receivables due from ERP Iron Ore.\nPaper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products. The four major paper and pulp mills"
