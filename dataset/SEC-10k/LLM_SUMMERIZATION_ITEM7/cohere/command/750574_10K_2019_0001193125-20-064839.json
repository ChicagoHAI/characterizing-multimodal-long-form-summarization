MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to provide information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, so you should refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank holding company after it acquired its Alabama predecessor, which was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's principal subsidiary, is an Alabama state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated continuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered in Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its business primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas. The Bank operates full-service branches in Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley, Alabama. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and Phenix City, Alabama.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: tax-equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income (GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,570 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(250 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net earnings per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (a) Tax-equivalent.

Basic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.72 per share for the full year 2019, compared to $2.42 per share for the full year 2018.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, a 2% increase compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates. Average loans grew 4% to $474.3 million in 2019, compared to $456.3 million in 2018. The Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) increased to 3.43% in 2019, compared to 3.40% in 2018 as yields on earning assets improved.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019 compared to no provision for loan losses during 2018. The provision for loan losses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, credit quality and the amount of net charge-offs. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.03% in 2019 compared to annualized net recoveries of 0.01% in 2018.\nNoninterest income was $5.5 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million payment received by the Company that resulted from the termination of a loan guarantee program operated by the State of Alabama and a $0.3 million pre-tax gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019. Mortgage lending income also increased $0.2 million, or 32%, as pricing margins improved and lower interest rates for mortgage loans positively affected refinance activity.\nNoninterest expense was $19.7 million in 2019 compared to $17.9 million in 2018. This increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense of $1.3 million and $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn, including professional fees, temporary relocation costs, and revised depreciation estimates. The Company expects it will incur additional expense in 2020 related to this redevelopment project.\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2018 reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.57% and 19.84%, respectively.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2019, an increase of 4.2% from 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 19.69%, a tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.23% and common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) of 18.78% at December 31, 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, the valuation of other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets, were critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations. Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions and may accordingly impact our financial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are charged off, in whole or in part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \u201cconfirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. The impairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its ongoing internal, independent loan review process. The Company's loan review process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. The Company's loan review process includes the judgment of management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. The Company incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment of the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments: commercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer installment loans. The Company analyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan segment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the probable losses inherent for these types of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based on the Company's internal system of credit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's internal system of credit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For loan segments where the Company believes it does not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may make adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted its historical loss rates for the commercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's estimate of probable losses for several \u201cqualitative and environmental\u201d factors. The allocation for qualitative and environmental factors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of the balance sheet date, and are based upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit concentration changes, prevailing economic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending policies or procedures and other influencing factors. These qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments and the allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased based on the incremental assessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance for loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. The Company believes the extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in which the Company experienced significant losses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance would decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company increased its look-back period to 43 quarters to continue to include losses incurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company will likely continue to increase its look-back period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. Other than expanding the look-back period each quarter, the Company has not made any material changes to its methodology that would impact the calculation of the allowance for loan losses or provision for loan losses for the periods included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine whether there have been events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity securities with an unrealized loss, the Company considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment; the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; and recent events specific to the issuer or industry. Equity securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses).\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary impairment write-down is triggered when (1) the Company has the intent to sell a debt security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference between the debt security's amortized cost and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment write-down is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nFair Value Determination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value, including investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures, please refer to Note 15, Fair Value, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available. Comparable assets or liabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets or liabilities do not have readily available active market pricing. However, some of the Company's assets or liabilities lack an available or comparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between willing buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair value is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and other pricing techniques. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions are based upon management's best estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates, prepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable market data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities and the related income and expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans and is reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other OREO.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over the last three years and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Interest Rates\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield/ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans and loans held for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>474,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.83% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>457,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.76% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities -

See \u201cTable 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was due to improvement in the Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) and balance sheet growth.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets increased by 9 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 3.97%. Expansion of our earning asset yields was primarily driven by loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates, which positively impacted the yields on our short-term assets, including federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits.\nThe cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 0.80%. The increase in our funding costs was primarily due to higher prevailing market interest rates.\nThe Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage its risk to interest rate fluctuations. The Company's net interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset yields, increased competition for quality loan opportunities, and possible increases in our costs of funds. Management anticipates the Company's net interest income and margin will likely decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 as the Company's ability to lower its deposit costs will likely continue to lag the current decrease in earning asset yields.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019, compared to no provision for loan losses in 2018. The negative provision was primarily related to a decline in total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and more specifically the construction and land development loan portfolio segment.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance for loan losses to an amount it believes to be appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio. The Company's allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased to 0.95% at December 31, 2019 from 1.00% at December 31, 2018. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are believed adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates and judgment and are therefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions exist which may negatively and materially affect our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage lending\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from loan guarantee program\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities losses, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(123 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>5,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The Company's income from mortgage lending is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage loans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains or losses from the sale of the mortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated with the origination of loans, which are netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The Company's normal practice is to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or retain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method. Servicing fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular group of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair value, a valuation allowance for that group is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease in the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's mortgage lending income for 2019 and 2018.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Origination income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Servicing fees, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage lending income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in mortgage lending income was primarily due to improved pricing margins and an increase in the level of refinance activity. The Company's income from mortgage lending typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily attributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $1.7 million resulting from the termination of a Loan Guarantee Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) operated by the State of Alabama. For more information regarding the Program, please refer to Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $0.3 million gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>11,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC and other regulatory assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>19,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in salaries and benefits expense in 2019 over 2018 was due to a variety of factors, including an increase in the number of employees, routine annual wage increases, incentive accrual increases, an increase in the employer matching contribution percentage under the Company's 401(k) Plan, and an increase in severance pay.\nThe increase in net occupancy and equipment expense and professional fees expense was primarily due to $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn. This amount includes revised depreciation estimates of $0.2 million. For more information regarding changes in accounting estimates, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe decrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments expense was primarily due to the Bank receiving an assessment credit of approximately $0.2 million to offset future assessments in connection with the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund exceeding its target ratio of 1.35% as of September 30, 2018. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was 1.36% at December 31, 2018, below the 1.38% threshold required for assessment credits to be applied. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was again below 1.38% at June 30, 2019, so assessment credit were applied against our assessment due for the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Future expense may continue to be reduced by these assessment credits depending on the level of the Deposit Insurance Fund, until they are fully utilized.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 compared to $2.2 million in 2018. The Company's effective income tax rate was 19.57% in 2019, compared to 19.84% in 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $235.9 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 2%, compared to $239.8 million as of December 31, 2018. This decline was primarily due to a decrease of $11.7 million in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale as proceeds from sales, calls, and maturities were not reinvested. This decrease was offset by an increase in the fair value of securities available-for-sale of $7.8 million. The average tax-equivalent yields earned on total securities were 2.72% in 2019 and 2.76% in 2018.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2019 according to contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

December 31, 2018. Four loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019: commercial real estate mortgage loans (59%), residential real estate mortgage loans (20%), commercial and industrial loans (12%) and construction and land development loans (7%). Approximately 23% of the Company's commercial real estate loans were classified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2019.\nWithin its residential real estate mortgage portfolio, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $10.8 million, or 2%, and $12.3 million, or 3%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, approximately $0.8 million and $0.5 million required interest-only payments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's residential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any option ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer mortgage products.\nPurchased loan participations included in the Company's loan portfolio were approximately $1.4 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All purchased loan participations are underwritten by the Company independent of the selling bank. In addition, all loans, including purchased participations, are evaluated for collectability during the course of the Company's normal loan review procedures. If the Company deems a participation loan impaired, it applies the same accounting policies and procedures described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.83% in 2019 and 4.76% in 2018.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include, but are not limited to, the effects of current economic conditions on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market sales volumes, valuations, and availability and cost of financing for properties, real estate industry concentrations, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate fluctuations, reduced collateral values or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration of borrowers, fraud, and any violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks by adhering to loan to value guidelines for collateralized loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial positions. Also, we establish and periodically review our lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's credit exposure by prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital accounts; or 20% of capital accounts, if loans in excess of 10% are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured loan relationships in excess of approximately $19.5 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit for aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $17.5 million. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had no loan relationships exceeding our internal limit.\nWe periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists in any one or more industries. We use classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in order to categorize our commercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes exceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019 (and related balances at December 31, 2018).\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel/motel\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lessors of 1-4 family residential properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shopping centers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,789 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office buildings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes appropriate to adequately cover the Company's estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the allowance for loan losses was $4.4 million and $4.8 million, which management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The judgments and estimates associated with the determination of the allowance for loan losses are described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nA summary of the changes in the allowance

As noted under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires various material estimates and judgments including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 0.95% at December 31, 2019, compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. In the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding ratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance assessment in their entirety either improve or weaken.\nNet charge-offs were $0.2 million, or 0.03%, of average loans in 2019, compared to net recoveries of $33 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans, in 2018.\nOur regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nNonperforming Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 the Company had $0.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to $0.4

discontinues the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or (2) the principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the Company had $0.2 million in loans on nonaccrual.\nDue to the weakening credit status of a borrower, the Company may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that minimizes the potential losses that we might incur. Restructured loans, or troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), are classified as impaired loans, and if the loans are on nonaccrual status as of the date of restructuring, the loans are included in the nonaccrual loan balances noted above. Nonaccrual loan balances do not include loans that have been restructured that were performing as of the restructure date. At December 31, 2019 the Company had no accruing TDRs compared to $0.2 million in accruing TDRs at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest.\nThe table below provides information concerning the composition of OREO at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Potential Problem Loans\nPotential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by the Federal Reserve, the Company's primary regulator, for loans classified as substandard, excluding nonaccrual loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to $4.4 million, or 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2019, compared to $6.5 million, or 1.4% of total loans at

Of the $5.4 million increase in interest-bearing deposits, $17.5 million was due to increases in NOW accounts and $2.4 million in savings accounts. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $10.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit and $3.6 million in retail certificates of deposit.\nThe average rates paid on total interest-bearing deposits were 0.80% in 2019 and 0.68% in 2018.

Short-term borrowings generally consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with an original maturity of one year or less. The Bank had available federal fund lines totaling $41.0 million with none outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $1.1 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe average rates paid on short-term borrowings was 0.49% and 0.68% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Information concerning the average balances, weighted average rates, and maximum amounts outstanding for short-term borrowings during the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 is included in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On April 27, 2018, the Company formally redeemed all of the issued and outstanding junior subordinated debentures, which were previously presented as long-term debt. The average rate paid on long-term debt in 2018 was 4.50%.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nThe Company's consolidated stockholders' equity was $98.3 million and $89.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change from December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by net earnings of $9.7 million and other comprehensive gain due to the change in unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, of $5.8 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid of $3.5 million and stock repurchases of $2.7 million, representing 77,907 shares.\nThe Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.23%, Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) risk-based capital ratio was 17.28%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 17.28%, and total risk-based capital ratio was 18.12% at December 31, 2019. These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital percentages of 5.0% for Tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1 risk-based capital ratio, 8.0% for Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d Based on current regulatory standards, the Bank is classified as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\nManagement's objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The Bank's Asset Liability Management Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity risk management.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example, if liabilities reprice faster than assets, and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline. In addition, assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising, the Company may increase rates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the interest spread between new loan yields and funding costs. Further, the remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may prepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings. Interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other items affecting earnings.\nALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements used to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation and an economic value of equity model.\nEarnings simulation. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our earnings simulation modeling. On at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period is simulated to determine a baseline net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. The baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or flat interest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates for the next 12 months and other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations and estimates.\nTo help limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income from gradual changes in interest rates. For changes up or down in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income variances are as follows:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> +/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net interest income forecast at December 31, 2019.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in Interest Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Interest Income % Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (100) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.27) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (200) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.99) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (300) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (400) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> NM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2019, our earnings simulation model indicated that we were in compliance with the policy guidelines noted above.\nEconomic Value of Equity. Economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d) measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are estimated by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our earnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over a 12 month timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon which allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items. Further, EVE is measured using values as of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates, or market and competitive conditions.\nTo help limit interest rate risk, we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rates, such that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more than the following:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> 45% for an instantaneous change of +/- 400 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> 35% for an instantaneous change of +/- 300 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> 25% for an instantaneous change of +/- 200 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> 15% for an instantaneous change of +/- 100 basis points\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate change in interest rates up or down when compared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2019.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Changes in Interest Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>EVE % Variance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.09) % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.16) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.74) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.62) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (100) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.33) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (200) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.08) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (300) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (400) basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> NM=not meaningful\nAt December 31, 2019, our EVE model indicated that we were in compliance with the policy guidelines noted above.\nEach of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates, and other economic and market factors, including market perceptions. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as \u201cinterest rate caps and floors\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates or economic stress, which may differ across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory, consistent levels of profitability within the framework of the Company's established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.\nThe Company may also use derivative financial instruments to improve the balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate sensitivity while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps (\u201cswaps\u201d) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no derivative contracts to assist in managing interest rate sensitivity.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the Company's ability to convert assets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements, primarily for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations. Without proper management of its liquidity, the Company could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity, while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher-yielding investment opportunities.\nLiquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the Company. The second is the liquidity of the Bank. The management of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities with different funding needs and sources, and each are subject to regulatory guidelines and requirements. The Company depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to pay its operating expenses, debt obligations and dividends. The Bank's payment of dividends depends on its earnings, liquidity, capital and the absence of any regulatory restrictions.\nThe primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has been dividends received from the Bank. If needed, the Company could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses of funds by the Company include dividends paid to stockholders and stock repurchases.\nPrimary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits, other borrowings, repayment and maturity of securities, and sale and repayment of loans. The Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window. In addition to these sources, the Bank has participated in the FHLB's advance program to obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed and variable terms and are taken out with varying maturities. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB totaling $246.7 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal funds lines, with none outstanding. Primary uses of funds include repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents additional information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, which by their terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2019:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 to 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 to 5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposit maturities (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 724,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>724,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> (1) Deposits with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, money market, and savings deposits) are presented in the \u201c1 year or less\u201d column\nManagement believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate sources of liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor requirements over the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2019, the Bank had outstanding standby letters of credit of $1.9 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of $60.6 million. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions.\nResidential mortgage lending and servicing activities\nSince 2009, we have primarily sold residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae while retaining the servicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage loans with Fannie Mae and other investors include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, among other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans, which we have originated and sold, but retained the servicing rights was $271.5 million. Although these loans are generally sold on a non-recourse basis, except for breaches of customary seller representations and warranties, we may have to repurchase residential mortgage loans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or the other terms of the sale, such as where we fail to deliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective. Investors also may require the repurchase of a mortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant underwriting deficiencies, even if the mortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred. We seek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims by mortgage loan investors through our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices, including good communications with our residential mortgage investors.\nThe Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2019 as a result of representation and warranty provisions contained in the Company's sale agreements with Fannie Mae. During 2018, the Company was required to repurchase one loan with an aggregate principal balance of $53 thousand that was current as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no pending repurchase or make-whole requests related to representation and warranty provisions.\nWe service all residential mortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer, our primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the potential losses to investors consistent with the agreements governing our rights and duties as servicer.\nThe agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by us in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined by servicing guides issued by Fannie Mae as well as the contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and the Bank. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.\nAlthough to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions, and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency if investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. As of December 31, 2019, we believe that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends, the results of our quality control reviews, and the fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for Fannie Mae were current as of such date. We maintain ongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nThe following ASUs have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> </td> <td> ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInformation about these pronouncements is described in more detail below.\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses using a broader range of information regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts assessing the collectability of cash flows. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however the new standard will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The Company has developed an implementation team that is following a general timeline. The team has been working with an advisory consultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased. The Company's preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuing to evaluate the extent of the potential impact and expects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at the time of adoption will be a factor. In November 2019, the FASB issued guidance to defer the effective dates for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying standards on current expected credit losses. As a result of this delay, the Company's effective dated for ASU 2016-13 was delayed to fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by eliminating the requirements to disclose (i) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (ii) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and (iii) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU also added specific disclosure requirements for fair value measurements for public entities including the requirement to disclose the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and all interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of the ASU. Entities are permitted to early adopt amendments that remove or modify disclosures and delay the adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2018- 15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include internal-use software license). This ASU requires entities to use the guidance in FASB ASC 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software, to determine whether to capitalize or expense implementation costs related to the service contract. This ASU also requires entities to (i) expense capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement; (ii) present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item on the income statement as fees associated with the hosting element of the arrangement; (iii) classify payments for capitalized implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element; and (iv) present the capitalized implementation costs in the same balance sheet line item that a prepayment for the fees associated with the hosting arrangement would be presented.\nThe amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this annual report on Form 10-K includes certain designated net interest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, including the presentation of total revenue and the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis provides comparability of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability within the industry. Although the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP is presented below.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Financial Summary\nThe Company's net earnings were $9.7 million for the full year 2019, compared to $8.8 million for the full year 2018. Basic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.72 per share for the full year 2019, compared to $2.42 per share for the full year 2018.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, a 2% increase compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates. Average loans grew 4% to $474.3 million in 2019, compared to $456.3 million in 2018. The Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) increased to 3.43% in 2019, compared to 3.40% in 2018 as yields on earning assets improved.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019 compared to no provision for loan losses during 2018. The provision for loan losses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, credit quality and the amount of net charge-offs. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.03% in 2019 compared to annualized net recoveries of 0.01% in 2018.\nNoninterest income was $5.5 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million payment received by the Company that resulted from the termination of a loan guarantee program operated by the State of Alabama and a $0.3 million pre-tax gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019. Mortgage lending income also increased $0.2 million, or 32%, as pricing margins improved and lower interest rates for mortgage loans positively affected refinance activity.\nNoninterest expense was $19.7 million in 2019 compared to $17.9 million in 2018. This increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense of $1.3 million and $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn, including professional fees, temporary relocation costs, and revised depreciation estimates. The Company expects it will incur additional expense in 2020 related to this redevelopment project.\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2018 reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.57% and 19.84%, respectively.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2019, an increase of 4.2% from 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 19.69%, a tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.23% and common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) of 18.78% at December 31, 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, the valuation of other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets, were critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations. Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions and may accordingly impact our financial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are charged off, in whole or in part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \u201cconfirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. The impairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its ongoing internal, independent loan review process. The Company's loan review process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. The Company's loan review process includes the judgment of management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. The Company incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment of the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments: commercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer installment loans. The Company analyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan segment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the probable losses inherent for these types of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based on the Company's internal system of credit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's internal system of credit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For loan segments where the Company believes it does not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may make adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted its historical loss rates for the commercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's estimate of probable losses for several \u201cqualitative and environmental\u201d factors. The allocation for qualitative and environmental factors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of the balance sheet date, and are based upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit concentration changes, prevailing economic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending policies or procedures and other influencing factors. These qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments and the allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased based on the incremental assessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance for loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. The Company believes the extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in which the Company experienced significant losses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance would decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company increased its look-back period to 43 quarters to continue to include losses incurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company will likely continue to increase its look-back period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. Other than expanding the look-back period each quarter, the Company has not made any material changes to its methodology that would impact the calculation of the allowance for loan losses or provision for loan losses for the periods included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine whether there have been events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity securities with an unrealized loss, the Company considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment; the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; and recent events specific to the issuer or industry. Equity securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses).\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary impairment write-down is triggered when (1) the Company has the intent to sell a debt security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference between the debt security's amortized cost and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment write-down is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nFair Value Determination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value, including investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures, please refer to Note 15, Fair Value, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available. Comparable assets or liabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets or liabilities do not have readily available active market pricing. However, some of the Company's assets or liabilities lack an available or comparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between willing buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair value is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and other pricing techniques. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions are based upon management's best estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates, prepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable market data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities and the related income and expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans and is reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other OREO.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over the last three years and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Interest Rates\n (a) Tax-equivalent. See \u201cTable 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was due to improvement in the Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) and balance sheet growth.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets increased by 9 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 3.97%. Expansion of our earning asset yields was primarily driven by loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates, which positively impacted the yields on our short-term assets, including federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits.\nThe cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 0.80%. The increase in our funding costs was primarily due to higher prevailing market interest rates.\nThe Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage its risk to interest rate fluctuations. The Company's net interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset yields, increased competition for quality loan opportunities, and possible increases in our costs of funds. Management anticipates the Company's net interest income and margin will likely decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 as the Company's ability to lower its deposit costs will likely continue to lag the current decrease in earning asset yields.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019, compared to no provision for loan losses in 2018. The negative provision was primarily related to a decline in total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and more specifically the construction and land development loan portfolio segment.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance for loan losses to an amount it believes to be appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio. The Company's allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased to 0.95% at December 31, 2019 from 1.00% at December 31, 2018. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are believed adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates and judgment and are therefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions exist which may negatively and materially affect our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\n The Company's income from mortgage lending is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage loans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains or losses from the sale of the mortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated with the origination of loans, which are netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The Company's normal practice is to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or retain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method. Servicing fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular group of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair value, a valuation allowance for that group is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease in the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's mortgage lending income for 2019 and 2018.\n The increase in mortgage lending income was primarily due to improved pricing margins and an increase in the level of refinance activity. The Company's income from mortgage lending typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily attributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $1.7 million resulting from the termination of a Loan Guarantee Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) operated by the State of Alabama. For more information regarding the Program, please refer to Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $0.3 million gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019.\nNoninterest Expense\n The increase in salaries and benefits expense in 2019 over 2018 was due to a variety of factors, including an increase in the number of employees, routine annual wage increases, incentive accrual increases, an increase in the employer matching contribution percentage under the Company's 401(k) Plan, and an increase in severance pay.\nThe increase in net occupancy and equipment expense and professional fees expense was primarily due to $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn. This amount includes revised depreciation estimates of $0.2 million. For more information regarding changes in accounting estimates, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe decrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments expense was primarily due to the Bank receiving an assessment credit of approximately $0.2 million to offset future assessments in connection with the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund exceeding its target ratio of 1.35% as of September 30, 2018. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was 1.36% at December 31, 2018, below the 1.38% threshold required for assessment credits to be applied. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was again below 1.38% at June 30, 2019, so assessment credit were applied against our assessment due for the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Future expense may continue to be reduced by these assessment credits depending on the level of the Deposit Insurance Fund, until they are fully utilized.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 compared to $2.2 million in 2018. The Company's effective income tax rate was 19.57% in 2019, compared to 19.84% in 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $235.9 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 2%, compared to $239.8 million as of December 31, 2018. This decline was primarily due to a decrease of $11.7 million in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale as proceeds from sales, calls, and maturities were not reinvested. This decrease was offset by an increase in the fair value of securities available-for-sale of $7.8 million. The average tax-equivalent yields earned on total securities were 2.72% in 2019 and 2.76% in 2018.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2019 according to contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty.\n Loans\n Total loans, net of unearned income, were $460.9 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $16.0 million, or 3%, from $476.9 million at December 31, 2018. Four loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019: commercial real estate mortgage loans (59%), residential real estate mortgage loans (20%), commercial and industrial loans (12%) and construction and land development loans (7%). Approximately 23% of the Company's commercial real estate loans were classified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2019.\nWithin its residential real estate mortgage portfolio, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $10.8 million, or 2%, and $12.3 million, or 3%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, approximately $0.8 million and $0.5 million required interest-only payments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's residential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any option ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer mortgage products.\nPurchased loan participations included in the Company's loan portfolio were approximately $1.4 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All purchased loan participations are underwritten by the Company independent of the selling bank. In addition, all loans, including purchased participations, are evaluated for collectability during the course of the Company's normal loan review procedures. If the Company deems a participation loan impaired, it applies the same accounting policies and procedures described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.83% in 2019 and 4.76% in 2018.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include, but are not limited to, the effects of current economic conditions on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market sales volumes, valuations, and availability and cost of financing for properties, real estate industry concentrations, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate fluctuations, reduced collateral values or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration of borrowers, fraud, and any violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks by adhering to loan to value guidelines for collateralized loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial positions. Also, we establish and periodically review our lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's credit exposure by prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital accounts; or 20% of capital accounts, if loans in excess of 10% are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured loan relationships in excess of approximately $19.5 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit for aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $17.5 million. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had no loan relationships exceeding our internal limit.\nWe periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists in any one or more industries. We use classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in order to categorize our commercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes exceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019 (and related balances at December 31, 2018).\n Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes appropriate to adequately cover the Company's estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the allowance for loan losses was $4.4 million and $4.8 million, which management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The judgments and estimates associated with the determination of the allowance for loan losses are described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nA summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses and certain asset quality ratios for each of the five years in the five year period ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\n As noted under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires various material estimates and judgments including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 0.95% at December 31, 2019, compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. In the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding ratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance assessment in their entirety either improve or weaken.\nNet charge-offs were $0.2 million, or 0.03%, of average loans in 2019, compared to net recoveries of $33 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans, in 2018.\nOur regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nNonperforming Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 the Company had $0.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to $0.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe table below provides information concerning total nonperforming assets and certain asset quality ratios.\n The table below provides information concerning the composition of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n The Company discontinues the accrual of interest income when (1) there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected or", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to provide information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, so you should refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became a bank holding company after it acquired its Alabama predecessor, which was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank, the Company's principal subsidiary, is an Alabama state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and has operated continuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are headquartered in Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its business primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and surrounding areas. The Bank operates full-service branches in Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley, Alabama. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Auburn and Phenix City, Alabama.\nSummary of Results of Operations\n Year ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 Net interest income (a) $ 26,621 $ 26,183 Less: tax-equivalent adjustment 557 613 Net interest income (GAAP) 26,064 25,570 Noninterest income 5,494 3,325 Total revenue 31,558 28,895 Provision for loan losses (250 ) - Noninterest expense 19,697 17,874 Income tax expense 2,370 2,187 Net earnings $ 9,741 $ 8,834 Basic and diluted net earnings per share $ 2.72 $ 2.42 (a) Tax-equivalent. See \u201cTable 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.  Financial Summary\nThe Company's net earnings were $9.7 million for the full year 2019, compared to $8.8 million for the full year 2018. Basic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.72 per share for the full year 2019, compared to $2.42 per share for the full year 2018.\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, a 2% increase compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates. Average loans grew 4% to $474.3 million in 2019, compared to $456.3 million in 2018. The Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) increased to 3.43% in 2019, compared to 3.40% in 2018 as yields on earning assets improved.\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019 compared to no provision for loan losses during 2018. The provision for loan losses is based upon various estimates and judgements, including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, credit quality and the amount of net charge-offs. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 0.03% in 2019 compared to annualized net recoveries of 0.01% in 2018.\nNoninterest income was $5.5 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million payment received by the Company that resulted from the termination of a loan guarantee program operated by the State of Alabama and a $0.3 million pre-tax gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019. Mortgage lending income also increased $0.2 million, or 32%, as pricing margins improved and lower interest rates for mortgage loans positively affected refinance activity.\nNoninterest expense was $19.7 million in 2019 compared to $17.9 million in 2018. This increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense of $1.3 million and $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn, including professional fees, temporary relocation costs, and revised depreciation estimates. The Company expects it will incur additional expense in 2020 related to this redevelopment project.\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2018 reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.57% and 19.84%, respectively.\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $1.00 per share in 2019, an increase of 4.2% from 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of 19.69%, a tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.23% and common equity tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) of 18.78% at December 31, 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry. In connection with the application of those principles, we have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses, our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, the valuation of other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets, were critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations. Other policies also require subjective judgment and assumptions and may accordingly impact our financial position and results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, current asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. Loans are charged off, in whole or in part, when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. A loan may be partially charged-off after a \u201cconfirming event\u201d has occurred which serves to validate that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is unlikely.\nThe Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement.\nAn impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. The impairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are impaired are recorded at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent, impairment measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated disposal costs.\nThe level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off.\nIn assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also considers the results of its ongoing internal, independent loan review process. The Company's loan review process assists in determining whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio. The Company's loan review process includes the judgment of management, the input from our independent loan reviewers, and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. The Company incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether or not it is probable that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.\nAs part of the Company's quarterly assessment of the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio into five segments: commercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer installment loans. The Company analyzes each segment and estimates an allowance allocation for each loan segment.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a process of estimating the probable losses inherent for these types of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category and based on the Company's internal system of credit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation rate for the Company's internal system of credit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded loans. For loan segments where the Company believes it does not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company may make adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the years then ended, the Company adjusted its historical loss rates for the commercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer bank groups.\nThe estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments is then adjusted for management's estimate of probable losses for several \u201cqualitative and environmental\u201d factors. The allocation for qualitative and environmental factors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation. This amount represents estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet been identified, as of the balance sheet date, and are based upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual loans, credit concentration changes, prevailing economic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience, changes in lending policies or procedures and other influencing factors. These qualitative and environmental factors are considered for each of the five loan segments and the allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted above, is increased or decreased based on the incremental assessment of these factors.\nThe Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the allowance for loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. The Company believes the extension of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early cycle periods in which the Company experienced significant losses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for loan losses and its balance would decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company increased its look-back period to 43 quarters to continue to include losses incurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Company will likely continue to increase its look-back period to incorporate the effects of at least one economic downturn in its loss history. Other than expanding the look-back period each quarter, the Company has not made any material changes to its methodology that would impact the calculation of the allowance for loan losses or provision for loan losses for the periods included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings.\nAssessment for Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine whether there have been events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity securities with an unrealized loss, the Company considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment; the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; and recent events specific to the issuer or industry. Equity securities for which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses).\nFor debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than-temporary impairment write-down is triggered when (1) the Company has the intent to sell a debt security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire difference between the debt security's amortized cost and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment write-down is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows. The remaining difference between the security's fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nFair Value Determination\nU.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value, including investments classified as available-for-sale and derivatives. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures, please refer to Note 15, Fair Value, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nFair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or liabilities when available. Comparable assets or liabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are used when identical assets or liabilities do not have readily available active market pricing. However, some of the Company's assets or liabilities lack an available or comparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between willing buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair value is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash flows and other pricing techniques. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions are based upon management's best estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates, prepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into account current observable market data and experience.\nThese assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities and the related income and expense. As such, the use of different models and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different net earnings and retained earnings results.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans and is reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell at the date acquired with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments are determined on a specific property basis and are included as a component of other noninterest expense along with holding costs. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected in noninterest expense. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other OREO.\nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income over the last three years and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Interest Rates\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield/ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield/ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans and loans held for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>474,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.83% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>457,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.76% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities -

See \u201cTable 1 - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income (tax-equivalent) was $26.6 million in 2019, compared to $26.2 million in 2018. This increase was due to improvement in the Company's net interest margin (tax-equivalent) and balance sheet growth.\nThe tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets increased by 9 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 3.97%. Expansion of our earning asset yields was primarily driven by loan growth and increases in short-term market interest rates, which positively impacted the yields on our short-term assets, including federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits.\nThe cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points in 2019 from 2018 to 0.80%. The increase in our funding costs was primarily due to higher prevailing market interest rates.\nThe Company continues to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage its risk to interest rate fluctuations. The Company's net interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced earning asset yields, increased competition for quality loan opportunities, and possible increases in our costs of funds. Management anticipates the Company's net interest income and margin will likely decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 as the Company's ability to lower its deposit costs will likely continue to lag the current decrease in earning asset yields.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million in 2019, compared to no provision for loan losses in 2018. The negative provision was primarily related to a decline in total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and more specifically the construction and land development loan portfolio segment.\nBased upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management adjusts the allowance for loan losses to an amount it believes to be appropriate to adequately cover probable losses in the loan portfolio. The Company's allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased to 0.95% at December 31, 2019 from 1.00% at December 31, 2018. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are believed adequate by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators, they are based on estimates and judgment and are therefore approximate and imprecise. Factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, a local real estate market or particular industry conditions exist which may negatively and materially affect our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage lending\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from loan guarantee program\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities losses, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(123 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>5,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The Company's income from mortgage lending is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale of new mortgage loans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is comprised of gains or losses from the sale of the mortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and other fees associated with the origination of loans, which are netted against the commission expense associated with these originations. The Company's normal practice is to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and to either sell or retain the MSRs when the loan is sold.\nMSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing right on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method. Servicing fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.\nThe Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular group of MSRs exceeds the group's aggregate fair value, a valuation allowance for that group is established. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates typically results in a decrease in the fair value of MSRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the Company's mortgage lending income for 2019 and 2018.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Origination income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Servicing fees, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total mortgage lending income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in mortgage lending income was primarily due to improved pricing margins and an increase in the level of refinance activity. The Company's income from mortgage lending typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily attributable to the origination and sale of new mortgage loans.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $1.7 million resulting from the termination of a Loan Guarantee Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) operated by the State of Alabama. For more information regarding the Program, please refer to Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $0.3 million gain from an insurance recovery received in the first quarter of 2019.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>11,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC and other regulatory assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,544 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td>19,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,874 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in salaries and benefits expense in 2019 over 2018 was due to a variety of factors, including an increase in the number of employees, routine annual wage increases, incentive accrual increases, an increase in the employer matching contribution percentage under the Company's 401(k) Plan, and an increase in severance pay.\nThe increase in net occupancy and equipment expense and professional fees expense was primarily due to $0.5 million of various expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company's headquarters in downtown Auburn. This amount includes revised depreciation estimates of $0.2 million. For more information regarding changes in accounting estimates, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.\nThe decrease in FDIC and other regulatory assessments expense was primarily due to the Bank receiving an assessment credit of approximately $0.2 million to offset future assessments in connection with the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund exceeding its target ratio of 1.35% as of September 30, 2018. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was 1.36% at December 31, 2018, below the 1.38% threshold required for assessment credits to be applied. The Deposit Insurance Fund ratio was again below 1.38% at June 30, 2019, so assessment credit were applied against our assessment due for the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Future expense may continue to be reduced by these assessment credits depending on the level of the Deposit Insurance Fund, until they are fully utilized.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $2.4 million in 2019 compared to $2.2 million in 2018. The Company's effective income tax rate was 19.57% in 2019, compared to 19.84% in 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nSecurities available-for-sale were $235.9 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 2%, compared to $239.8 million as of December 31, 2018. This decline was primarily due to a decrease of $11.7 million in the amortized cost basis of securities available-for-sale as proceeds from sales, calls, and maturities were not reinvested. This decrease was offset by an increase in the fair value of securities available-for-sale of $7.8 million. The average tax-equivalent yields earned on total securities were 2.72% in 2019 and 2.76% in 2018.\nThe following table shows the carrying value and weighted average yield of securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2019 according to contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or prepaid with or without penalty.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

December 31, 2018. Four loan categories represented the majority of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019: commercial real estate mortgage loans (59%), residential real estate mortgage loans (20%), commercial and industrial loans (12%) and construction and land development loans (7%). Approximately 23% of the Company's commercial real estate loans were classified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2019.\nWithin its residential real estate mortgage portfolio, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $10.8 million, or 2%, and $12.3 million, or 3%, of total loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose, approximately $0.8 million and $0.5 million required interest-only payments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's residential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any option ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount of other high-risk consumer mortgage products.\nPurchased loan participations included in the Company's loan portfolio were approximately $1.4 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All purchased loan participations are underwritten by the Company independent of the selling bank. In addition, all loans, including purchased participations, are evaluated for collectability during the course of the Company's normal loan review procedures. If the Company deems a participation loan impaired, it applies the same accounting policies and procedures described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nThe average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.83% in 2019 and 4.76% in 2018.\nThe specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio include, but are not limited to, the effects of current economic conditions on our borrowers' cash flows, real estate market sales volumes, valuations, and availability and cost of financing for properties, real estate industry concentrations, deterioration in certain credits, interest rate fluctuations, reduced collateral values or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals, financial deterioration of borrowers, fraud, and any violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit risks by adhering to loan to value guidelines for collateralized loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers' financial positions. Also, we establish and periodically review our lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a bank's credit exposure by prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its capital accounts; or 20% of capital accounts, if loans in excess of 10% are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited from having secured loan relationships in excess of approximately $19.5 million. Furthermore, we have an internal limit for aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $17.5 million. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed this internal limit. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had no loan relationships exceeding our internal limit.\nWe periodically analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists in any one or more industries. We use classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services industry in order to categorize our commercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the following classes exceeded 25% of the Bank's total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019 (and related balances at December 31, 2018).\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multi-family residential properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hotel/motel\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lessors of 1-4 family residential properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shopping centers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,789 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office buildings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes appropriate to adequately cover the Company's estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the allowance for loan losses was $4.4 million and $4.8 million, which management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. The judgments and estimates associated with the determination of the allowance for loan losses are described under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nA summary of the changes in the allowance

As noted under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of each calendar quarter. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires various material estimates and judgments including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 0.95% at December 31, 2019, compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. In the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding ratio will increase or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our quarterly allowance assessment in their entirety either improve or weaken.\nNet charge-offs were $0.2 million, or 0.03%, of average loans in 2019, compared to net recoveries of $33 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans, in 2018.\nOur regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\nNonperforming Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 the Company had $0.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to $0.4
