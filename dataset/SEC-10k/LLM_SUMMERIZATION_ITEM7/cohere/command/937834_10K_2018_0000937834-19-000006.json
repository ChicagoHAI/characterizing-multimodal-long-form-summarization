Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the Company's results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, adjusted earnings, that is not based on GAAP. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for a definition and discussion of this and other financial measures, and - Results of Operations\u201d for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nOverview\nMLIC is a provider of insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MLIC is organized into two segments: U.S. and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, given the complexities of U.S. Tax Reform, there still remain uncertainties surrounding aspects of the new law that may impact results in the future. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of U.S. Tax Reform.\nSeparation of Brighthouse\nIn August 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Brighthouse\u201d) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the Separation\u201d). MetLife, Inc. retained the remaining ownership interest of 22,996,436 shares, or 19.2%, of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock outstanding.\nIn June 2018, MetLife, Inc. sold Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in exchange for MetLife, Inc. senior notes and Brighthouse was no longer considered a related party. At December 31, 2018, MetLife, Inc. no longer held any shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for its own account; however, certain insurance company separate accounts managed by MetLife held shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>investment impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td>measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.0%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThrough September 30, 2018, the Company sponsored and/or administered various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering eligible employees who meet specified eligibility requirements of the sponsor and its participating affiliates. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the change in plan sponsor from the Company to an affiliate effective October 1, 2018, as well as amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee also Notes 1 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, net income (loss), or adjusted earnings.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nIn 2016, MLIC distributed to MetLife, Inc., as a non-cash extraordinary dividend, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of each of New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO\u201d) and General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d). See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales in our U.S. segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased over 2017 levels reflecting higher sales of pension risk transfers (driven by a large transaction in the second quarter of 2018) and stable value products, partially offset by a decrease in funding agreement issuances, as well as lower sales of specialized life insurance and structured settlement products, all within our RIS business. Sales in our Group Benefits business were slightly lower compared to 2017, as the impact of strong jumbo case sales in our core products in 2017 more than offset strong sales in our voluntary products in 2018. Revenues in our MetLife Holdings segment decreased as a result of the discontinuance of the marketing of life and annuity products in early 2017.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>2,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>10,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>1,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>42,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>30,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>4,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>37,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before provision for income tax\n</td> <td>4,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net income (loss) increased $609 million from 2017, primarily driven by favorable changes in adjusted earnings and net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by a 2017 tax benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform and an unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses).\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our liquidity objectives are met under a range of market conditions. For example, during 2017, we restructured certain derivative hedges to decrease volatility from nonqualified interest rate derivatives and to help meet liquidity objectives under varying interest rate scenarios. As part of this restructuring, we replaced certain nonqualified derivatives with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In addition, we also entered into replication transactions using interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at amortized cost under statutory guidelines and are nonqualified derivatives under GAAP.\nCertain direct or assumed variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use reinsurance and derivatives to hedge the market and other risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ceded reinsurance of direct variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits generally contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of recently adopted NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivative hedges, are referred to as VA program derivatives.\u201d All other embedded derivatives and all freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives.\u201d The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange rate\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives - direct and assumed guarantees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risks\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other risks\n</td> <td>(293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>(69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives - ceded reinsurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market and other risks\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivatives hedging direct and assumed embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $1.2 billion ($912 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to other key currencies in 2018 versus mostly weakening in 2017, favorably impacting foreign currency swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. Also, there was a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. These increases were partially offset by credit spreads widening in 2018 while narrowing in 2017, unfavorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications and long-term interest rates increasing in 2018 while mostly decreasing in 2017, unfavorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate total return swaps. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $45 million ($36 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. The primary change in other risks was due to the impact of variable annuity reinsurance recaptures, which occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe aforementioned unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in market factors and other risks.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Key equity index levels decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index decreased 6% in 2018 and increased 19% in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term U.S. interest rates increased in 2018 and mostly decreased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding interest rate derivatives, which was partially mitigated by the restructuring of the VA hedging strategy. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate increased 30 basis points in 2018 and decreased 5 basis points in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to a favorable change of $96 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and a favorable change of $20 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the direct and assumed variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.\nGenerally, a higher portion of the ceded reinsurance for GMIBs is accounted for as an embedded derivative as compared to the direct guarantees since the settlement provisions of the reinsurance agreements generally meet the accounting criteria of net settlement.\u201d This mismatch in accounting can lead to significant volatility in earnings, even though the risks inherent in these direct guarantees are fully covered by the ceded reinsurance.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $181 million ($143 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects lower gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation impacts on unhedged guaranteed investment contracts.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for 2018 include a $120 million ($95 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3 million gain ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $120 million charge, $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $71 million ($56 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $120 million charge that was included in adjusted earnings was a gain of $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax).\nThe $3 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were due to operational assumption updates related to the projection of closed block results in the MetLife Holdings segment, and are summarized as follows:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic assumption updates resulted in net favorable changes to reserves, partially offset by unfavorable changes to DAC for a net favorable impact of $60 million ($47 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes to biometric assumptions resulted in net favorable changes to DAC, partially offset by unfavorable changes in reserves for a net favorable impact of $33 million ($26 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in net unfavorable changes to reserves, partially offset by favorable changes to DAC for a net unfavorable impact of $116 million ($91 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in operational assumptions resulted in a net charge of $97 million ($77 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Results for 2017 include a $39 million ($25 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which an $18 million ($12 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $39 million gain, a $106 million ($69 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was associated with DAC, offset by a $67 million ($44 million, net of 2017 income tax) loss related to reserves. The portion of the $39 million gain that was included in adjusted earnings was $105 million ($68 million, net of 2017 income tax).\nCertain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2018 include a $74 million ($59 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2018 increase in our incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments were included in adjusted earnings.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $173 million, or 4% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with an income tax benefit of $561 million, or 19% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. Our 2018 results include the following tax items: (i) a net tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which includes a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), (ii) an adjusted earnings benefit of $93 million related to U.S. Tax Reform (comprised of a $139 million tax benefit and a $46 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (iii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our 2017 results include the following tax items: (i) a net benefit of $1.0 billion related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform which includes a $1.4 billion tax benefit and an adjusted earnings charge of $360 (comprised of a $316 million tax charge and a $44 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million from the finalization of certain tax audits.\nAdjusted Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings increased $1.4 billion, net of income tax, to $3.8 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.4 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Other adjustments to net income (1)\n</td> <td>(538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Provision for income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See definitions and components of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses under - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures.\u201d Further, see - Reconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\u201d for additional details on these adjustments by financial statement line item.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Adjustments from total revenues to adjusted revenues, in the line items indicated:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Adjustments from total expenses to adjusted expenses, in the line items indicated:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were the favorable impact of U.S. Tax Reform, other favorable tax items, higher net investment income due to higher investment yields and a larger asset base, net favorable refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities and favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher interest credited expenses and the net unfavorable change from our annual actuarial assumption review.\nU.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in adjusted earnings of $902 million for 2018 compared to 2017, which includes a slight reduction in net investment income related to tax credit partnership investments. Our 2018 results include a tax benefit of $449 million, primarily related to the lower tax rate, as well as a tax benefit of $139 million to reflect a revision to the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. Our 2017 results include a tax charge of $316 million to reflect the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nBusiness Growth. Net investment income improved as a result of higher average invested assets in our U.S. segment, partially offset by a reduced asset base in our MetLife Holdings segment. The higher asset base in our U.S. segment was due to the impact of increased premiums and deposits, primarily from pension risk transfer sales, partially offset by a decrease in net flows from funding agreements. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from positive net flows in the U.S segment, interest credited on long-duration and deposit-type liabilities increased. In our MetLife Holdings segment, negative net flows in our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life sales resulted in lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower deferred annuities interest credited expense, decreasing adjusted earnings. Higher interest credited on insurance liabilities in our MetLife Holdings segment also decreased adjusted earnings. In our U.S. segment, higher volume-related, direct and premium tax expenses were partially offset by lower pension and post-retirement expenses. However, this net increase in expenses, coupled with the increase due to the 2018 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, were more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, increased adjusted earnings by $11 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields were positively impacted by higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, higher returns on fair value option securities ( FVO Securities\u201d) and real estate investments, lower investment expenses and higher prepayment fees. The resulting increase in net investment income was partially offset by lower returns on private equities, driven by a decrease in partnership distributions, as well as lower earnings on our securities lending program, primarily resulting from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. The net increase in investment yields was more than offset by higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expenses, primarily in our U.S. segment. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $70 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Actuarial Assumption Review. Favorable underwriting increased adjusted earnings by $119 million due to favorable morbidity experience of $77 million and favorable mortality experience of $42 million, primarily in our U.S. segment. The favorable morbidity experience in our U.S. segment was due to favorable renewal results, as well as lower claim incidence and severity in our group disability business, coupled with growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business, partially offset by less favorable claims experience in our dental and vision businesses. Favorable morbidity experience in our MetLife Holdings segment was primarily due to the impact of favorable rate actions in our long-term care business. Favorable mortality results in our U.S. segment were mainly due to our specialized life insurance, pension risk transfer, structured settlements and universal life businesses, partially offset by less favorable claim experience in our term life business. This was partially offset by unfavorable mortality results in our MetLife Holdings segment as a result of higher life claim severity. Our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $46 million in adjusted earnings when compared to 2017, primarily due to less favorable changes in operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, maintenance and other expenses.\nOther Insurance Adjustments. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both 2018 and 2017, resulted in a $171 million increase in adjusted earnings. This includes the following 2018 refinements: (i) a favorable insurance adjustment in our U.S. segment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business; (ii) a favorable reserve adjustment in our MetLife Holdings segment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; and (iii) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. This also includes the following 2017 refinements in our MetLife Holdings segment: (i) the net unfavorable impact from a life reinsurance recapture; (ii) the unfavorable impact from the recapture and novation of, as well as adjustments to, assumed and ceded agreements covering certain variable annuity business; (iii) an unfavorable DAC adjustment related to certain assumed participating whole life business; and (iv) a favorable reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business reserving process; as well as a 2017 charge related to an increase in certain RIS policy reserves in our U.S. segment.\nExpenses. Our unit cost initiative contributed to an improvement in adjusted earnings of $19 million primarily due to lower (i) Separation-related expenses, (ii) employee-related expenses, including expenses related to pension and postretirement benefits, (iii) expenses for interest on certain tax positions, as well as expenses incurred in 2017 related to the guaranty fund assessment for Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by increases in (i) litigation accruals, (ii) costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, and (iii) other corporate-related expenses. The increase in costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects was primarily due to expenses associated with the continued investment in our unit cost initiative, partially offset by lease impairments in 2017 and lower costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives in 2018.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. This incremental tax benefit was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 which resulted in a $48 million decrease in adjusted earnings. Our results for 2018 include the following tax items: (i) a tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which included a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our results for 2017 include a tax benefit of $36 million from tax audit settlements.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by GRM, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates.

A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities AFS and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including with respect to the U.K.'s planned withdrawal from the European Union.

In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers and their tenants and joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, and changes in certain market factors: interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain NGEs of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. We hedge risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation by hedging with foreign currency derivatives. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk.\nWe enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determines that a credit event has occurred.\nWe use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging, which gives us more flexibility in managing credit exposures. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as economic hedges which mitigate our credit exposure.\nCurrent Environment\nThe global economy and markets continue to be affected by the changing financial and economic environment. As an insurance company with significant operations in the United States, we are affected by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States, and also the monetary policy of central banks around the world due to the diversification of our investment portfolio. See - Selected Country and Sector Investments.\u201d Citing a strengthening economy, the Federal Reserve Board has continued along its stated path of balance sheet tapering and the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Open Market Committee has continued to increase the federal funds rate, most recently in December 2018 and has since left interest rates unchanged. The Federal Reserve, as well as other central banks, may take further actions, including with respect to the level of interest rates, which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. The current environment continues to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\u201d\nEuropean Investments\nWe maintain general account investments in Europe in order to diversify our global portfolio. In Europe, we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries, including the U.K., France, the Netherlands and Germany. The sovereign and agency debt of these countries continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings from all major rating agencies. European sovereign and agency fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Our European corporate securities (fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock) are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities, which comprised $12.6 billion, or 72% of European corporate securities, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2018. Of these European fixed maturity securities AFS, 93% were investment grade and, for the 7% that were below investment grade, the majority were non-financial services corporate securities at December 31, 2018. European financial services corporate securities, at estimated fair value, were $4.9 billion (including $2.3 billion within the banking sector) with 98% investment grade, at December 31, 2018. Total European fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, were $19.0 billion at December 31, 2018, including $285 million of Structured Securities (see - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\u201d).\nSelected Country and Sector Investments\nWe have country specific exposure to volatility, as we maintain general account investments in the selected countries through our global portfolio diversification. In addition, we have sector specific exposure to volatility, including the impact of lower oil prices and variability in oil prices, on the energy sector.\nSelected Country: The following table presents a summary of fixed maturity securities AFS in these countries. The information below is presented on a country of risk basis (e.g. the country where the issuer primarily conducts business).

We maintain a diversified energy sector fixed maturities securities AFS portfolio across sub-sectors and issuers. This portfolio comprised 2% of total investments at December 31, 2018.\nWe manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries and the energy sector through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. We do not expect that our general account investments in these countries or the energy sector will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nInvestment Portfolio Results\nThe reconciliation of net investment income under GAAP to net investment income, as reported on an adjusted earnings basis, is presented below.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income - GAAP basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investment hedge adjustments\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income, as reported on an adjusted basis (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures - Adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses - Net investment income\u201d for a discussion of the adjustments made to net investment income under GAAP in calculating net investment income, as reported on an adjusted basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following yield table presents our investment portfolio results for the periods indicated.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities AFS if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as perpetual hybrid securities,\u201d have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or Tier 1 capital\u201d and perpetual deferrable securities, or Upper Tier 2 capital\u201d).\nRedeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities AFS. These securities, which are commonly referred to as capital securities,\u201d primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.\nValuation of Securities. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services' use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities AFS were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2018.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, new transaction types and markets are reviewed and approved to ensure that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. Senior management oversees the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing.\nWe review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management's knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. We ensure that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as consensus pricing,\u201d are representative of estimated fair value by considering such pricing relative to our knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio.\nWe also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management's best estimate is used.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three-level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets.\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Maturity\nSecurities AFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\nSecurities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>134,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant other observable inputs\n</td> <td>136,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>7,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent broker quotations\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant unobservable inputs\n</td> <td>10,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy.\nThe majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities and RMBS at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS decreased by $1.0 billion, or 9%. The decrease was driven by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in net income.\nSee - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities - Valuation of Securities\u201d for further information regarding the composition of fair value pricing sources for securities. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level and by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities and continuous gross unrealized losses.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called NAIC designations.\u201d If no designation is available from the NAIC, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities AFS, except for certain Structured Securities as described below. Rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's, S&P, Fitch, Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC ( Morningstar\u201d). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for certain Structured Securities comprised of non-agency RMBS, CMBS and ABS. The NAIC's objective with the revised methodologies for these Structured Securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such Structured Securities. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from Structured Securities. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to Structured Securities held by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as it maintains the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC's present methodology is to evaluate Structured Securities held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If Metropolitan Life Insurance Company acquires Structured Securities that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until an NAIC designation becomes available. NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for certain Structured Securities, which are presented using the revised NAIC methodologies as described above, as well as the percentage,

</tr>\n</table>\nCollateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nThe majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody's, S&P or Fitch; and were designated NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ( Alt-A\u201d) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.\nIncluded within prime and Alt-A RMBS are re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduit ( Re-REMIC\u201d) securities. Re-REMIC RMBS involve the pooling of previous issues of prime and Alt-A RMBS and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and subordinated securities. The credit enhancement on the senior tranches is improved through the re-securitization.\nHistorically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions, and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2). The estimated fair value of our sub-prime RMBS holdings purchased since 2012 was $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with unrealized gains (losses) of $193 million at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nABS\nOur ABS holdings are diversified both by collateral type and by issuer.

The most significant increase in OTTI losses were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities, which comprised $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. An increase of $18 million in OTTI losses was mainly concentrated in consumer securities and was a result of issuer specific factors.\nIn 2018, we adopted new guidance under which equity securities are no longer evaluated for impairment, rather are measured at fair value through net income. Accordingly, there were no equity securities impairments for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity securities AFS were $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The most significant decrease in OTTI losses were in U.S. and foreign corporate securities, which comprised $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. A decrease of $76 million in OTTI losses was concentrated in industrial securities and was the result of lower oil prices impacting the energy sector in 2016.\nOverall OTTI losses recognized in earnings on equity securities were $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $51 million, reflecting the impact of lower oil prices impacting the energy sector in 2016.\nFuture Impairments\nFuture OTTI on fixed maturity securities AFS will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, and foreign currency exchange rates. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new guidance to be adopted in 2020 regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.\nSecurities Lending and Repurchase Agreements\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks.

Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios, 87% are collateralized by properties located in the United States, with the remaining 13% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, which includes 6% of properties located in the U.K., at December 31, 2018. The carrying values of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans located in California, New York and Texas were 19%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at December 31, 2018. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\nWe manage our residential mortgage loan portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration. All residential mortgage loans were collateralized by properties located in the United States at December 31, 2018.

We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, impaired loans, as well as the carrying value of foreclosed mortgage loans included in real estate and real estate joint ventures.\nWe review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.\nLoan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 55% and 54% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.4x and 2.6x at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 45% and 44% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nMortgage Loan Valuation Allowances. Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.\nThe determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored and activity in and balances of the valuation allowance as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nReal estate and real estate joint ventures is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate and, to a lesser extent, joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as a runoff portfolio. The carrying values of real estate and real estate joint ventures were $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, or 2.3% and 2.5% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The estimated fair value of our real estate investments was $10.9 billion and $11.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThere were $13 million of impairments recognized on real estate and real estate joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. Depreciation expense on real estate investments was $65 million, $76 million and $68 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Real estate investments were net of accumulated depreciation of $671 million and $668 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration.\nGeographical diversification: Substantially all of our real estate investments, excluding funds, were located in the United States at December 31, 2018. The carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in California, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts were 22%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at December 31, 2018. The majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the United States.\nProperty type diversification: Real estate and real estate joint venture investments by property type are categorized by sector as follows at:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>1,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apartment\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate and real estate joint ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests was $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion, or 1.7% and 1.5% of cash and invested assets, which included $285 million and $262 million of hedge funds, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds.\nOther Invested Assets\nThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships\n</td> <td>2,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Affiliated investments\n</td> <td>2,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Annuities funding structured settlement claims (1)\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leveraged leases\n</td> <td>932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FHLB common stock (2)\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Operating joint venture\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FVO Securities\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Direct financing leases\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Funds withheld\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of cash and invested assets\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2) See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLeveraged lease impairments were $105 million, $79 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSee Notes 1, 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, affiliated investments, annuities funding structured settlement claims, leveraged and direct financing leases, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) common stock, FVO Securities, an operating joint venture and funds withheld.\nDerivatives\nDerivative Risks\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Information about the gross notional amount, estimated fair value, and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The statement of operations effects of derivatives in cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedge relationships for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures - Hedging Activities\u201d for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.\nThe valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nDerivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2018 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At December 31, 2018, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.\nCredit Risk\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.\nOur policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps at:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Default Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nNotional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nNotional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nThe following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gains (losses) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) for credit default swaps as follows:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Default Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nLosses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nGains\n(Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nLosses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nGains\n(Losses)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Written (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The favorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of $25 million was due to certain credit spreads on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds widening in the current period as compared to narrowing in the prior period. The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of ($192) million was due to certain credit spreads on certain credit default swaps used as replications widening in the current period as compared to narrowing in the prior period.\nThe maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCredit Facility\nSee - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Global Funding Sources - Credit Facility\u201d and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information including the classification of expenses and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on the facility.\nCollateral for Securities Lending and Derivatives\nWe participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. Periodically, we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $64 million and $11 million at estimated fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as - Investments - Securities Lending and Repurchase Agreements\u201d for further discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangements and associated liabilities.\nWe enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We receive non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral\u201d and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.\nLease Commitments\nAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nSee Guarantees\u201d in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nWe enter into the following additional commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Net Investment Income\u201d and Net Investment Gains (Losses)\u201d in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, and gains and losses from such investments. See also - Investments - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\u201d and - Investments - Mortgage Loans\u201d for information on our investments in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. See - Investments - Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\u201d and - Investments - Other Limited Partnership Interests\u201d for information on our partnership investments.\nOther than the commitments disclosed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. For further information on commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nInsolvency Assessments\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.\nShort-term Liquidity\nWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $2.4 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquid Assets\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $80.2 billion and $86.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets and global funding sources, including commercial paper and the Credit Facility.\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition. See Risk Factors - Investment Risks - We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value.\u201d\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\nRating Agencies\nRating agencies assign insurer financial strength and credit ratings to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and MetLife, Inc.'s other insurance subsidiaries, as well as credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Credit ratings indicate the rating agency's opinion regarding a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.\nDowngrades in our insurer financial strength or credit ratings, MetLife, Inc.'s credit ratings or changes to our or MetLife, Inc.'s ratings outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - A Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings or MetLife, Inc.'s Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nA downgrade in our insurer financial strength or credit ratings or the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc. or its other subsidiaries would likely impact us in the following ways, including:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our RIS business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact the cost and availability of financing for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. See - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatutory Capital and Dividends\nWe have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statement filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\nThe amount of dividends that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company can pay to MetLife, Inc. is constrained by the amount of surplus Metropolitan Life Insurance Company holds to maintain its ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See Business - Regulation - Insurance Regulation\u201d and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company cedes specific policy classes, including ordinary life insurance, participating whole life insurance and long-term disability insurance, to a wholly-owned offshore reinsurer. The wholly-owned offshore reinsurer currently only reinsures Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's business and the results of the offshore reinsurer are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. MetLife, Inc. has also provided a guarantee of the wholly-owned offshore reinsurer's payment obligations on a retrocession agreement entered into by the reinsurer. In addition, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company cedes specific policy classes, including term life insurance, universal life insurance and ordinary and industrial life insurance, to other affiliated captive reinsurers. MetLife, Inc. has committed to maintain the surplus of the other affiliated captive reinsurers, as well as provide a guarantee of one such captive reinsurer's repayment obligations on letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. The statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and the letters of credit. We enter into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies and other business.\nThe NYDFS continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. We are not aware of any states other than New York and California implementing such a moratorium. While such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our RBC ratio and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. This could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. While this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. We continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our reinsurance activities.\nSummary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities, net\n</td> <td>3,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt issued\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents balances\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources\n</td> <td>11,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>4,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n</td> <td>1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt repaid\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing element on certain derivative instruments and other derivative related transactions, net\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends of subsidiaries\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends paid to MetLife, Inc.\n</td> <td>3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return of capital associated with the purchase of operating joint venture interest from an affiliate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents balances\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total uses\n</td> <td>9,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption.\nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends on Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's common stock, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in - Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,\u201d the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nGlobal Funding Sources\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, the Credit Facility and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\nCommercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\nMetLife Funding and MetLife, Inc. each have a commercial paper program that is supported by the Credit Facility (see - Credit Facility\u201d). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company and its former insurance subsidiary, GALIC, are members of regional FHLBs. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued $26.1 billion, $20.4 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, and repaid $26.3 billion, $20.4 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. In December 2016, $625 million of funding agreement obligations were deconsolidated due to the disposition of GALIC. At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSpecial Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain special purpose entities ( SPEs\u201d) that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued $41.8 billion, $42.7 billion and $39.7 billion, respectively, and repaid $43.7 billion, $41.4 billion and $38.5 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $32.3 billion and $34.2 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe have issued funding agreements to a subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural mortgage loans. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued $900 million, $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and repaid $900 million, $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.6 billion. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLong-term Debt Issued\nIn August 2017, a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company issued $139 million of long-term debt to a third party.\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2018, MetLife Funding and MetLife, Inc. maintained the Credit Facility. When drawn upon, this facility bears interest at varying rates in accordance with the agreement.\nThe Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers' commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $412 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility, and affiliates had $34 million in letters of credit outstanding against this facility. Remaining availability was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Credit Facility.\nWe have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under this facility. As commitments under the Credit Facility may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nOutstanding Debt Under Global Funding Sources\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt excluding long-term debt relating to CSEs at:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes $30 million and $143 million of debt that is non-recourse to the Company, subject to customary exceptions, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Certain investment subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt and Facility Covenants\nCertain of our debt instruments and the Credit Facility contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in - Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\u201d and - Contractual Obligations,\u201d the Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nDividends\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company paid cash dividends to MetLife, Inc. of $3.7 billion, $2.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2016, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a non-cash extraordinary dividend all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of each of NELICO and GALIC. The net book value of NELICO and GALIC at the time of the dividend was $2.9 billion, which was recorded as a dividend of retained earnings of $2.7 billion and a decrease to other comprehensive income of $254 million, net of income tax. See Notes 3 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt Repayments\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In December 2018, a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company repaid $50 million of its $350 million aggregate principal amount three-month LIBOR plus 3.10% term loan; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In December 2016, $107 million 7.625% surplus notes were deconsolidated due to the disposition of GALIC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupport Agreements\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company is a party to a capital support commitment with its subsidiary, MetLife Funding. Under the arrangement, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital requirements. We anticipate that in the event this arrangement places demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet such demands.\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. In the RIS business within the U.S. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at December 31, 2018, there were funding agreements totaling $148 million that could be put back to the Company.\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had received pledged cash collateral from counterparties of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had pledged cash collateral to counterparties of $1 million and $188 million, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us and collateral we pledge.\nWe pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurities Lending\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $13.4 billion and $15.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of these amounts, $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at December 31, 2018 was $1.9 billion, all of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRepurchase Agreements\nWe participate in short-term repurchase agreements whereby securities are loaned to unaffiliated financial institutions. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under these repurchase agreements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $1.0 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan at December 31, 2018 was $1.0 billion, all of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLitigation\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at December 31, 2018:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than One Year to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than Three Years to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>104,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n</td> <td>18,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>3,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitments\n</td> <td>8,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>23,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Liabilities\nInsurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. All estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. Because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented on the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. Additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $222.9 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $134.3 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP. See - Policyholder Account Balances.\u201d\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nSee Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. See - Insurance Liabilities\u201d regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\nAmounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $104.1 billion exceeds the liability amount of $90.7 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nPayables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nWe have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivatives. As the securities lending transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table above. We also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2018.\nDebt\nAmounts presented for debt include short-term debt and long-term debt, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented herein (i) do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) include future interest on such obligations for the period from January 1, 2019 through maturity; and (iii) do not include long-term debt relating to CSEs at December 31, 2018 as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. Future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at December 31, 2018 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from January 1, 2019 through maturity. Total debt at December 31, 2018 included affiliated debt obligations of $1.7 billion.\nInvestment Commitments\nTo enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. In the table above, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. As it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. Commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\u201d\nOperating Leases\nAs a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. Contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. However, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nOther obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. If the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. Items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $638 million were excluded as the timing of payment could not be reliably determined at December 31, 2018.\nSeparate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.\nWe also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, to subsidiaries and affiliates relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nIn this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP financial measures:\n</td> <td>Comparable GAAP financial measures:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>(i)\n</td> <td>revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>(ii)\n</td> <td>expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>(iii)\n</td> <td>net income (loss)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures are included in the results of operations, see - Results of Operations.\u201d Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income.\nOur definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings\nThis measure is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results.\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.\nAdjusted revenues and adjusted expenses\nThe financial measures of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MLIC but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also includes the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MLIC that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP. Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses).\nThe following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees ( GMIB fees\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net investment income: (i) includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment ( Investment hedge adjustments\u201d), (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP and (iv) includes distributions of profits from certain other limited partnership interests that were previously accounted for under the cost method, but are now accounted for at estimated fair value, where the change in estimated fair value is recognized in net investment gains (losses) under GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs ( GMIB costs\u201d) and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ( Market value adjustments\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs, and (iii) Market value adjustments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) acquisition, integration and other costs, and (iii) goodwill impairments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company's effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.\nThe following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We sometimes refer to sales activity for various products.

We believe that excluding the impact of asymmetrical and non-economic accounting from total GAAP results enhances investor understanding of our performance by disclosing how these accounting practices affect reported GAAP results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocated equity is the portion of common stockholders' equity that MetLife's management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital.

and a decrease in expenses, resulting in a substantial boost in profit compared to the previous year.\n- Total revenue for the year amounted to $42,161,000, a significant increase of 37% from the $30,182,000 recorded in 2016.\n- The significant increase in revenue is attributed to the success of the company's new product line, which witnessed a surge in demand and contributed to an increase in sales, driving overall revenue growth.\n- In terms of expenses, the company reported expenditures of $37,225,000 for the year, representing a 7% decrease from the $40,461,000 incurred in 2016.\n- The decrease in expenses is largely attributed to stringent cost-cutting measures implemented throughout the year, resulting in improved cost efficiency.\n- Consequently, the company recorded a net profit of $3,527,000 for the year, a notable improvement from the $2,235,000 net profit achieved in the previous year.\n- The improved financial performance reflects the effectiveness of the company's

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIndex to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information\nFor purposes of this discussion, MLIC,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation incorporated in 1868, and its subsidiaries. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the Company's results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, adjusted earnings, that is not based on GAAP. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for a definition and discussion of this and other financial measures, and - Results of Operations\u201d for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nOverview\nMLIC is a provider of insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MLIC is organized into two segments: U.S. and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, given the complexities of U.S. Tax Reform, there still remain uncertainties surrounding aspects of the new law that may impact results in the future. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of U.S. Tax Reform.\nSeparation of Brighthouse\nIn August 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Brighthouse\u201d) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the Separation\u201d). MetLife, Inc. retained the remaining ownership interest of 22,996,436 shares, or 19.2%, of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock outstanding.\nIn June 2018, MetLife, Inc. sold Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in exchange for MetLife, Inc. senior notes and Brighthouse was no longer considered a related party. At December 31, 2018, MetLife, Inc. no longer held any shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for its own account; however, certain insurance company separate accounts managed by MetLife held shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n\nIn applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.0%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThrough September 30, 2018, the Company sponsored and/or administered various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering eligible employees who meet specified eligibility requirements of the sponsor and its participating affiliates. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the change in plan sponsor from the Company to an affiliate effective October 1, 2018, as well as amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee also Notes 1 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, net income (loss), or adjusted earnings.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nIn 2016, MLIC distributed to MetLife, Inc., as a non-cash extraordinary dividend, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of each of New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO\u201d) and General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d). See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales in our U.S. segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased over 2017 levels reflecting higher sales of pension risk transfers (driven by a large transaction in the second quarter of 2018) and stable value products, partially offset by a decrease in funding agreement issuances, as well as lower sales of specialized life insurance and structured settlement products, all within our RIS business. Sales in our Group Benefits business were slightly lower compared to 2017, as the impact of strong jumbo case sales in our core products in 2017 more than offset strong sales in our voluntary products in 2018. Revenues in our MetLife Holdings segment decreased as a result of the discontinuance of the marketing of life and annuity products in early 2017.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net income (loss) increased $609 million from 2017, primarily driven by favorable changes in adjusted earnings and net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by a 2017 tax benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform and an unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses).\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our liquidity objectives are met under a range of market conditions. For example, during 2017, we restructured certain derivative hedges to decrease volatility from nonqualified interest rate derivatives and to help meet liquidity objectives under varying interest rate scenarios. As part of this restructuring, we replaced certain nonqualified derivatives with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In addition, we also entered into replication transactions using interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at amortized cost under statutory guidelines and are nonqualified derivatives under GAAP.\nCertain direct or assumed variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use reinsurance and derivatives to hedge the market and other risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ceded reinsurance of direct variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits generally contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of recently adopted NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivative hedges, are referred to as VA program derivatives.\u201d All other embedded derivatives and all freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives.\u201d The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\n\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $1.2 billion ($912 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to other key currencies in 2018 versus mostly weakening in 2017, favorably impacting foreign currency swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. Also, there was a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. These increases were partially offset by credit spreads widening in 2018 while narrowing in 2017, unfavorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications and long-term interest rates increasing in 2018 while mostly decreasing in 2017, unfavorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate total return swaps. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $45 million ($36 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. The primary change in other risks was due to the impact of variable annuity reinsurance recaptures, which occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe aforementioned unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in market factors and other risks.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Key equity index levels decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index decreased 6% in 2018 and increased 19% in 2017. \n \u2022 Long-term U.S. interest rates increased in 2018 and mostly decreased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding interest rate derivatives, which was partially mitigated by the restructuring of the VA hedging strategy. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate increased 30 basis points in 2018 and decreased 5 basis points in 2017.  We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to a favorable change of $96 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and a favorable change of $20 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the direct and assumed variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.\nGenerally, a higher portion of the ceded reinsurance for GMIBs is accounted for as an embedded derivative as compared to the direct guarantees since the settlement provisions of the reinsurance agreements generally meet the accounting criteria of net settlement.\u201d This mismatch in accounting can lead to significant volatility in earnings, even though the risks inherent in these direct guarantees are fully covered by the ceded reinsurance.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $181 million ($143 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects lower gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation impacts on unhedged guaranteed investment contracts.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for 2018 include a $120 million ($95 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3 million gain ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $120 million charge, $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $71 million ($56 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $120 million charge that was included in adjusted earnings was a gain of $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax).\nThe $3 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were due to operational assumption updates related to the projection of closed block results in the MetLife Holdings segment, and are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Economic assumption updates resulted in net favorable changes to reserves, partially offset by unfavorable changes to DAC for a net favorable impact of $60 million ($47 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes to biometric assumptions resulted in net favorable changes to DAC, partially offset by unfavorable changes in reserves for a net favorable impact of $33 million ($26 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in net unfavorable changes to reserves, partially offset by favorable changes to DAC for a net unfavorable impact of $116 million ($91 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in operational assumptions resulted in a net charge of $97 million ($77 million, net of income tax).  Results for 2017 include a $39 million ($25 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which an $18 million ($12 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $39 million gain, a $106 million ($69 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was associated with DAC, offset by a $67 million ($44 million, net of 2017 income tax) loss related to reserves. The portion of the $39 million gain that was included in adjusted earnings was $105 million ($68 million, net of 2017 income tax).\nCertain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2018 include a $74 million ($59 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2018 increase in our incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments were included in adjusted earnings.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $173 million, or 4% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with an income tax benefit of $561 million, or 19% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. Our 2018 results include the following tax items: (i) a net tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which includes a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), (ii) an adjusted earnings benefit of $93 million related to U.S. Tax Reform (comprised of a $139 million tax benefit and a $46 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (iii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our 2017 results include the following tax items: (i) a net benefit of $1.0 billion related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform which includes a $1.4 billion tax benefit and an adjusted earnings charge of $360 (comprised of a $316 million tax charge and a $44 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million from the finalization of certain tax audits.\nAdjusted Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings increased $1.4 billion, net of income tax, to $3.8 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.4 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings\n\n______________\n (1) See definitions and components of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses under - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures.\u201d Further, see - Reconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\u201d for additional details on these adjustments by financial statement line item. \nReconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\n\nConsolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were the favorable impact of U.S. Tax Reform, other favorable tax items, higher net investment income due to higher investment yields and a larger asset base, net favorable refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities and favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher interest credited expenses and the net unfavorable change from our annual actuarial assumption review.\nU.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in adjusted earnings of $902 million for 2018 compared to 2017, which includes a slight reduction in net investment income related to tax credit partnership investments. Our 2018 results include a tax benefit of $449 million, primarily related to the lower tax rate, as well as a tax benefit of $139 million to reflect a revision to the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. Our 2017 results include a tax charge of $316 million to reflect the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nBusiness Growth. Net investment income improved as a result of higher average invested assets in our U.S. segment, partially offset by a reduced asset base in our MetLife Holdings segment. The higher asset base in our U.S. segment was due to the impact of increased premiums and deposits, primarily from pension risk transfer sales, partially offset by a decrease in net flows from funding agreements. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from positive net flows in the U.S segment, interest credited on long-duration and deposit-type liabilities increased. In our MetLife Holdings segment, negative net flows in our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life sales resulted in lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower deferred annuities interest credited expense, decreasing adjusted earnings. Higher interest credited on insurance liabilities in our MetLife Holdings segment also decreased adjusted earnings. In our U.S. segment, higher volume-related, direct and premium tax expenses were partially offset by lower pension and post-retirement expenses. However, this net increase in expenses, coupled with the increase due to the 2018 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, were more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, increased adjusted earnings by $11 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields were positively impacted by higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, higher returns on fair value option securities ( FVO Securities\u201d) and real estate investments, lower investment expenses and higher prepayment fees. The resulting increase in net investment income was partially offset by lower returns on private equities, driven by a decrease in partnership distributions, as well as lower earnings on our securities lending program, primarily resulting from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. The net increase in investment yields was more than offset by higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expenses, primarily in our U.S. segment. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $70 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Actuarial Assumption Review. Favorable underwriting increased adjusted earnings by $119 million due to favorable morbidity experience of $77 million and favorable mortality experience of $42 million, primarily in our U.S. segment. The favorable morbidity experience in our U.S. segment was due to favorable renewal results, as well as lower claim incidence and severity in our group disability business, coupled with growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business, partially offset by less favorable claims experience in our dental and vision businesses. Favorable morbidity experience in our MetLife Holdings segment was primarily due to the impact of favorable rate actions in our long-term care business. Favorable mortality results in our U.S. segment were mainly due to our specialized life insurance, pension risk transfer, structured settlements and universal life businesses, partially offset by less favorable claim experience in our term life business. This was partially offset by unfavorable mortality results in our MetLife Holdings segment as a result of higher life claim severity. Our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $46 million in adjusted earnings when compared to 2017, primarily due to less favorable changes in operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, maintenance and other expenses.\nOther Insurance Adjustments. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both 2018 and 2017, resulted in a $171 million increase in adjusted earnings. This includes the following 2018 refinements: (i) a favorable insurance adjustment in our U.S. segment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business; (ii) a favorable reserve adjustment in our MetLife Holdings segment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; and (iii) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. This also includes the following 2017 refinements in our MetLife Holdings segment: (i) the net unfavorable impact from a life reinsurance recapture; (ii) the unfavorable impact from the recapture and novation of, as well as adjustments to, assumed and ceded agreements covering certain variable annuity business; (iii) an unfavorable DAC adjustment related to certain assumed participating whole life business; and (iv) a favorable reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business reserving process; as well as a 2017 charge related to an increase in certain RIS policy reserves in our U.S. segment.\nExpenses. Our unit cost initiative contributed to an improvement in adjusted earnings of $19 million primarily due to lower (i) Separation-related expenses, (ii) employee-related expenses, including expenses related to pension and postretirement benefits, (iii) expenses for interest on certain tax positions, as well as expenses incurred in 2017 related to the guaranty fund assessment for Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by increases in (i) litigation accruals, (ii) costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, and (iii) other corporate-related expenses. The increase in costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects was primarily due to expenses associated with the continued investment in our unit cost initiative, partially offset by lease impairments in 2017 and lower costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives in 2018.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. This incremental tax benefit was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 which resulted in a $48 million decrease in adjusted earnings. Our results for 2018 include the following tax items: (i) a tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which included a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our results for 2017 include a tax benefit of $36 million from tax audit settlements.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by GRM, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\n \u2022 credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; \n \u2022 interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; \n \u2022 liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; \n \u2022 market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities AFS and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; \n \u2022 currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including with respect to the U.K.'s planned withdrawal from the European Union. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and \n \u2022 real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers and their tenants and joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, and changes in certain market factors: interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.  We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife\u201d). Management's narrative analysis of the Company's results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Risk Factors,\u201d Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, adjusted earnings, that is not based on GAAP. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for a definition and discussion of this and other financial measures, and - Results of Operations\u201d for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nOverview\nMLIC is a provider of insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MLIC is organized into two segments: U.S. and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, given the complexities of U.S. Tax Reform, there still remain uncertainties surrounding aspects of the new law that may impact results in the future. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of U.S. Tax Reform.\nSeparation of Brighthouse\nIn August 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Brighthouse\u201d) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the Separation\u201d). MetLife, Inc. retained the remaining ownership interest of 22,996,436 shares, or 19.2%, of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock outstanding.\nIn June 2018, MetLife, Inc. sold Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in exchange for MetLife, Inc. senior notes and Brighthouse was no longer considered a related party. At December 31, 2018, MetLife, Inc. no longer held any shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for its own account; however, certain insurance company separate accounts managed by MetLife held shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>investment impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td>measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.0%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC and VOBA.\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThrough September 30, 2018, the Company sponsored and/or administered various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering eligible employees who meet specified eligibility requirements of the sponsor and its participating affiliates. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the change in plan sponsor from the Company to an affiliate effective October 1, 2018, as well as amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. We determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result, the Company recognized the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform for the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, its income tax accounting was not complete due to uncertainties that existed at the time. Accordingly, certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts were revised in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSee also Notes 1 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in MetLife's and the Company's business.\nMetLife's economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company's consolidated net investment income, net income (loss), or adjusted earnings.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company's product pricing.\nDispositions\nIn 2016, MLIC distributed to MetLife, Inc., as a non-cash extraordinary dividend, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of each of New England Life Insurance Company ( NELICO\u201d) and General American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d). See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales in our U.S. segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased over 2017 levels reflecting higher sales of pension risk transfers (driven by a large transaction in the second quarter of 2018) and stable value products, partially offset by a decrease in funding agreement issuances, as well as lower sales of specialized life insurance and structured settlement products, all within our RIS business. Sales in our Group Benefits business were slightly lower compared to 2017, as the impact of strong jumbo case sales in our core products in 2017 more than offset strong sales in our voluntary products in 2018. Revenues in our MetLife Holdings segment decreased as a result of the discontinuance of the marketing of life and annuity products in early 2017.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>2,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>10,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>1,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>42,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>30,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>4,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>37,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before provision for income tax\n</td> <td>4,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net income (loss) increased $609 million from 2017, primarily driven by favorable changes in adjusted earnings and net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by a 2017 tax benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform and an unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses).\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our liquidity objectives are met under a range of market conditions. For example, during 2017, we restructured certain derivative hedges to decrease volatility from nonqualified interest rate derivatives and to help meet liquidity objectives under varying interest rate scenarios. As part of this restructuring, we replaced certain nonqualified derivatives with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In addition, we also entered into replication transactions using interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at amortized cost under statutory guidelines and are nonqualified derivatives under GAAP.\nCertain direct or assumed variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use reinsurance and derivatives to hedge the market and other risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ceded reinsurance of direct variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits generally contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of recently adopted NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). Direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity embedded derivatives, as well as the associated freestanding derivative hedges, are referred to as VA program derivatives.\u201d All other embedded derivatives and all freestanding derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives.\u201d The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange rate\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives - direct and assumed guarantees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risks\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other risks\n</td> <td>(293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>(69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Embedded derivatives - ceded reinsurance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market and other risks\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivatives hedging direct and assumed embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $1.2 billion ($912 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to other key currencies in 2018 versus mostly weakening in 2017, favorably impacting foreign currency swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. Also, there was a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. These increases were partially offset by credit spreads widening in 2018 while narrowing in 2017, unfavorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications and long-term interest rates increasing in 2018 while mostly decreasing in 2017, unfavorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate total return swaps. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $45 million ($36 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) in market and other risks on direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of the impact of market and other risks on the ceded reinsurance embedded derivatives and net of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. The primary change in other risks was due to the impact of variable annuity reinsurance recaptures, which occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe aforementioned unfavorable change of $161 million ($127 million, net of income tax) was primarily driven by changes in market factors and other risks.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Key equity index levels decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index decreased 6% in 2018 and increased 19% in 2017. \n \u2022 Long-term U.S. interest rates increased in 2018 and mostly decreased in 2017, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding interest rate derivatives, which was partially mitigated by the restructuring of the VA hedging strategy. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate increased 30 basis points in 2018 and decreased 5 basis points in 2017.  We calculate the nonperformance risk adjustment as the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-adjusted rate (which includes our own credit spread to the extent that the embedded derivative is in-the-money) less the change in the embedded derivative discounted at the risk-free rate. The favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives of $116 million ($92 million, net of income tax) was primarily due to a favorable change of $96 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, and a favorable change of $20 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the direct and assumed variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk on the direct and assumed variable annuity embedded derivatives. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.\nGenerally, a higher portion of the ceded reinsurance for GMIBs is accounted for as an embedded derivative as compared to the direct guarantees since the settlement provisions of the reinsurance agreements generally meet the accounting criteria of net settlement.\u201d This mismatch in accounting can lead to significant volatility in earnings, even though the risks inherent in these direct guarantees are fully covered by the ceded reinsurance.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $181 million ($143 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects lower gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation impacts on unhedged guaranteed investment contracts.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for 2018 include a $120 million ($95 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $3 million gain ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $120 million charge, $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $71 million ($56 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $120 million charge that was included in adjusted earnings was a gain of $49 million ($39 million, net of income tax).\nThe $3 million gain recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were due to operational assumption updates related to the projection of closed block results in the MetLife Holdings segment, and are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Economic assumption updates resulted in net favorable changes to reserves, partially offset by unfavorable changes to DAC for a net favorable impact of $60 million ($47 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes to biometric assumptions resulted in net favorable changes to DAC, partially offset by unfavorable changes in reserves for a net favorable impact of $33 million ($26 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in net unfavorable changes to reserves, partially offset by favorable changes to DAC for a net unfavorable impact of $116 million ($91 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in operational assumptions resulted in a net charge of $97 million ($77 million, net of income tax).  Results for 2017 include a $39 million ($25 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which an $18 million ($12 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $39 million gain, a $106 million ($69 million, net of 2017 income tax) gain was associated with DAC, offset by a $67 million ($44 million, net of 2017 income tax) loss related to reserves. The portion of the $39 million gain that was included in adjusted earnings was $105 million ($68 million, net of 2017 income tax).\nCertain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2018 include a $74 million ($59 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2018 increase in our incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments were included in adjusted earnings.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $173 million, or 4% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, compared with an income tax benefit of $561 million, or 19% of income (loss) before provision for income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. Our 2018 results include the following tax items: (i) a net tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which includes a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), (ii) an adjusted earnings benefit of $93 million related to U.S. Tax Reform (comprised of a $139 million tax benefit and a $46 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (iii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our 2017 results include the following tax items: (i) a net benefit of $1.0 billion related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform which includes a $1.4 billion tax benefit and an adjusted earnings charge of $360 (comprised of a $316 million tax charge and a $44 million, net of income tax, reduction in net investment income), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million from the finalization of certain tax audits.\nAdjusted Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings increased $1.4 billion, net of income tax, to $3.8 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2.4 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Other adjustments to net income (1)\n</td> <td>(538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Provision for income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n (1) See definitions and components of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses under - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures.\u201d Further, see - Reconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\u201d for additional details on these adjustments by financial statement line item. \nReconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and expenses to adjusted expenses\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Adjustments from total revenues to adjusted revenues, in the line items indicated:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(344\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>(385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Adjustments from total expenses to adjusted expenses, in the line items indicated:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were the favorable impact of U.S. Tax Reform, other favorable tax items, higher net investment income due to higher investment yields and a larger asset base, net favorable refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities and favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher interest credited expenses and the net unfavorable change from our annual actuarial assumption review.\nU.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in adjusted earnings of $902 million for 2018 compared to 2017, which includes a slight reduction in net investment income related to tax credit partnership investments. Our 2018 results include a tax benefit of $449 million, primarily related to the lower tax rate, as well as a tax benefit of $139 million to reflect a revision to the estimated impact from the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. Our 2017 results include a tax charge of $316 million to reflect the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nBusiness Growth. Net investment income improved as a result of higher average invested assets in our U.S. segment, partially offset by a reduced asset base in our MetLife Holdings segment. The higher asset base in our U.S. segment was due to the impact of increased premiums and deposits, primarily from pension risk transfer sales, partially offset by a decrease in net flows from funding agreements. Consistent with the growth in average invested assets from positive net flows in the U.S segment, interest credited on long-duration and deposit-type liabilities increased. In our MetLife Holdings segment, negative net flows in our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life sales resulted in lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower deferred annuities interest credited expense, decreasing adjusted earnings. Higher interest credited on insurance liabilities in our MetLife Holdings segment also decreased adjusted earnings. In our U.S. segment, higher volume-related, direct and premium tax expenses were partially offset by lower pension and post-retirement expenses. However, this net increase in expenses, coupled with the increase due to the 2018 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, were more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, increased adjusted earnings by $11 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields were positively impacted by higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, higher returns on fair value option securities ( FVO Securities\u201d) and real estate investments, lower investment expenses and higher prepayment fees. The resulting increase in net investment income was partially offset by lower returns on private equities, driven by a decrease in partnership distributions, as well as lower earnings on our securities lending program, primarily resulting from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. The net increase in investment yields was more than offset by higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expenses, primarily in our U.S. segment. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $70 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Actuarial Assumption Review. Favorable underwriting increased adjusted earnings by $119 million due to favorable morbidity experience of $77 million and favorable mortality experience of $42 million, primarily in our U.S. segment. The favorable morbidity experience in our U.S. segment was due to favorable renewal results, as well as lower claim incidence and severity in our group disability business, coupled with growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business, partially offset by less favorable claims experience in our dental and vision businesses. Favorable morbidity experience in our MetLife Holdings segment was primarily due to the impact of favorable rate actions in our long-term care business. Favorable mortality results in our U.S. segment were mainly due to our specialized life insurance, pension risk transfer, structured settlements and universal life businesses, partially offset by less favorable claim experience in our term life business. This was partially offset by unfavorable mortality results in our MetLife Holdings segment as a result of higher life claim severity. Our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $46 million in adjusted earnings when compared to 2017, primarily due to less favorable changes in operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, maintenance and other expenses.\nOther Insurance Adjustments. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both 2018 and 2017, resulted in a $171 million increase in adjusted earnings. This includes the following 2018 refinements: (i) a favorable insurance adjustment in our U.S. segment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business; (ii) a favorable reserve adjustment in our MetLife Holdings segment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; and (iii) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. This also includes the following 2017 refinements in our MetLife Holdings segment: (i) the net unfavorable impact from a life reinsurance recapture; (ii) the unfavorable impact from the recapture and novation of, as well as adjustments to, assumed and ceded agreements covering certain variable annuity business; (iii) an unfavorable DAC adjustment related to certain assumed participating whole life business; and (iv) a favorable reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business reserving process; as well as a 2017 charge related to an increase in certain RIS policy reserves in our U.S. segment.\nExpenses. Our unit cost initiative contributed to an improvement in adjusted earnings of $19 million primarily due to lower (i) Separation-related expenses, (ii) employee-related expenses, including expenses related to pension and postretirement benefits, (iii) expenses for interest on certain tax positions, as well as expenses incurred in 2017 related to the guaranty fund assessment for Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by increases in (i) litigation accruals, (ii) costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, and (iii) other corporate-related expenses. The increase in costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects was primarily due to expenses associated with the continued investment in our unit cost initiative, partially offset by lease impairments in 2017 and lower costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives in 2018.\nTaxes and Other Tax-Related Items. The Company's effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. This incremental tax benefit was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 which resulted in a $48 million decrease in adjusted earnings. Our results for 2018 include the following tax items: (i) a tax-related benefit of $359 million related to the settlement of tax audits, which included a $349 million benefit related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit), and (ii) a benefit of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Our results for 2017 include a tax benefit of $36 million from tax audit settlements.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investments Risk Committee, chaired by GRM, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\n \u2022 credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; \n \u2022 interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; \n \u2022 liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; \n \u2022 market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities AFS and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; \n \u2022 currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including with respect to the U.K.'s planned withdrawal from the European Union. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and \n \u2022 real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers and their tenants and joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, and changes in certain market factors: interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.  We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single"}
