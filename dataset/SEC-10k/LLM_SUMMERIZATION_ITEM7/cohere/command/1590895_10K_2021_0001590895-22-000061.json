See Item 1A, Risk Factors-CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d of this report.\nObjective\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to be a narrative explanation of the financial statements and other statistical data that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements to enhance an investor's understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Our objectives are: (i) to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that will enable investors to see the Company through the eyes of management; (ii) to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and (iii) to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flows so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. ( Isle\u201d or Isle of Capri\u201d) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, we completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation ( Former Caesars\u201d) pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from ERI\u201d to CZR\u201d.\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion (the William Hill Acquisition\u201d).\nWe currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 52 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 55,700 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,900 table games and approximately 47,700 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties' gaming operations, retail and online sports betting as well as online gaming, and we utilize hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 20 of our casinos and leased 26 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ( VICI\u201d) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease. In addition, we lease seven casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ( GLPI\u201d) pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the GLPI Master Lease\u201d) and a Lumi\u00e8re lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the GLPI Leases\u201d). Additionally, we lease the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino from a separate third party. See descriptions under the GLPI Leases\u201d and VICI Leases.\u201d\nWe also operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 states and domestic jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in five states. Our recently launched Caesars Sportsbook app operates on the Liberty platform, which we acquired in the William Hill Acquisition along with other technology platforms that we intend to migrate to the Liberty platform in the future, subject to required approvals. The map below illustrates Caesars Digital's presence as of December 31, 2021:\nSubsequent to December 31, 2021, we launched mobile sports betting on our Liberty platform in New York on January 8, 2022 and Louisiana on January 28, 2022 and went live with retail sports betting in Washington on February 10, 2022. We are also in the process of expanding our Caesars Digital footprint into other states in the near term.\nWe periodically divest of assets in order to raise capital or as a result of a determination that the assets are not core to our business. We also divested certain assets in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals related to closing of the Merger. A summary of recently completed and planned divestitures of our properties as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Date Sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales Price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Presque Isle Downs & Casino ( Presque\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>January 11, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$179 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin ( Nemacolin\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>March 8, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort ( Mountaineer\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Isle Casino Cape Girardeau ( Cape Girardeau\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville ( Caruthersville\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Isle of Capri Casino Kansas City ( Kansas City\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg ( Vicksburg\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Eldorado Resort Casino Shreveport ( Eldorado Shreveport\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 23, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$140 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>MontBleu Casino Resort & Spa ( MontBleu\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>April 6, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$15 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Tropicana Evansville ( Evansville\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>June 3, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$480 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel ( Baton Rouge\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Harrah's Reno </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$42 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Bally's Atlantic City </td> <td> </td> <td>November 18, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$25 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Harrah's Louisiana Downs </td> <td> </td> <td>November 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$22 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Caesars Southern Indiana </td> <td> </td> <td>September 3, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$250 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>Emerald Resort & Casino </td> <td> </td> <td>July 16, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>Caesars Entertainment UK </td> <td> </td> <td>July 16, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>William Hill International </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a32.2 billion\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n*Not meaningful.\n(a)Mountaineer, Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville were sold for aggregate consideration of $385 million.\n(b)Kansas City and Vicksburg were sold for aggregate consideration of $230 million.\n(c)The proceeds of this sale were split between the Company and VICI.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion on these key transactions and any applicable gain (loss) or impairment charges recorded.\nMerger and Acquisitions Related Activities\nAcquisition of William Hill\nOn September 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day \u00a31.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day \u00a3116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the Debt Financing\u201d). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The \u00a31.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement ( Interim Facilities Agreement\u201d) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, the Company repaid the \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full \u00a3116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of \u00a3700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, William Hill International\u201d), all of which are held for sale and reflected within\ndiscontinued operations. Certain investments acquired will be excluded from the held for sale group.\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately \u00a32.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, and other working capital adjustments, the Company expects to receive approximately \u00a3835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC ( Horseshoe Baltimore\u201d), a property which we also managed, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. We were subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and have consolidated the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. As a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our Managed and Branded segment. Operations following the consolidation event are presented within our Regional segment.\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets\n\u2022Diversification of the Company's domestic footprint\n\u2022Access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience\n\u2022Realization of significant identified synergies\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvestments and Partnerships\nNeoGames\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. ( NeoGames\u201d), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately 2 million shares of NeoGames common stock with a fair value of $60 million. The shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the Company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (Level 1). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss to the investment in NeoGames of $54 million, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nThe Stars Group/Flutter Entertainment\nIn November 2018, the Company entered into a 20-year agreement with The Stars Group Inc. ( TSG\u201d) pursuant to which we agreed to provide TSG with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to states in which our properties are located. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 1 million TSG common shares. The fair value of the shares received was deferred and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the 20-year agreement term. In addition, we received a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by TSG under our licenses. In December 2020, the Company sold a portion of these Flutter shares for net proceeds of $24 million.\nOn July 7, 2021, the Company sold all remaining Flutter shares for $9 million. The Company recorded a loss of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within Other income (loss) on our Statements of Operations.\nPompano Joint Venture\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies ( Cordish\u201d) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company's Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company's input and will submit it for the Company's review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash since the inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of December 31, 2021. We entered into a short-term lease agreement in February 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.\nWhile the Company holds a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction costs and other operating costs on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company's investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.\nReportable Segments\nSegment results in this MD&A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a significant market\u201d basis. Management views each of the Company's casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Prior to the William Hill Acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in three regionally-focused reportable segments: Las Vegas, Regional, and Managed, International, CIE, in addition to Corporate and Other.\nThe William Hill Acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, Caesars Interactive Entertainment CIE\u201d and now, inclusive of William Hill US, Caesars Digital\u201d) expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and iGaming gaming operations. As a result, the Company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. The Las Vegas and Regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former Managed, International and CIE reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments; Caesars Digital and Managed and Branded. Accordingly, our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See Item 2. Properties\u201d for listing of properties by segment.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company's sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. Refer to Reportable Segments\u201d above for a discussion of changes to the Company's reportable segments.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&A in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. In June 2021, the Indiana Gaming Commission amended its order that previously required the Company to sell a third casino asset in the state of Indiana. As a result, Horseshoe Hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. The assets and liabilities previously held\nfor sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. Additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented.\nKey Performance Metrics\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. Additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications.\nKey performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 14% to 23% of table game drop in the Las Vegas segment and 18% to 21% of table game drop in the Regional segment. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See Results of Operations\u201d section below. Complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Financial Results\nThe following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAcquisitions and Transaction Costs\n\u2022Acquisition of William Hill - On April 22, 2021, the Company consummated its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction of \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion. We recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International.\n\u2022Consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore - On August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore to approximately 75.8%. Prior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. As a result of the consolidation, the Company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation - The Merger closed on July 20, 2020. The Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations\n\u2022Divestitures and Discontinued Operations - See Overview\u201d section above for detail on properties divested or held for sale, including related discontinued operations.\nFinancing and Lease Transactions\n\u2022Debt Transactions - In connection with the Merger, we issued new notes, entered into a new credit agreement and assumed certain of Former Caesars indebtedness. In addition, we terminated previously outstanding credit agreements and discharged outstanding notes. During 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029, we repriced the Incremental CRC Term Loan, we fully converted the outstanding the 5% Convertible Notes, we purchased or redeemed the entire $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding CRC Notes of, and we purchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of CEI Senior Notes. As a result of these transactions, described more fully in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we experienced some interest savings subsequent to these transactions. Additionally, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $236 million and\n$197 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Operations.\n\u2022VICI Leases - Upon consummation of the Merger, CEI assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from VICI by Former Caesars under various lease agreements. We recorded interest expense of $1.1 billion and $519 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the VICI Leases. Our VICI Leases also contain annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index ( CPI\u201d), with a floor of 2%.\n\u2022GLPI Leases - We have accounted for the GLPI Leases as deferred financing obligations. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $111 million, $104 million and $99 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the GLPI Leases. Our GLPI Leases also contain an annual escalation provision based on stated rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.0% per year.\nOther Significant Factors\n\u2022COVID-19 Public Health Emergency - In January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified and has since spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\nWe experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although we have experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\n\u2022Impairment Charges - As a result of COVID-19, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our Regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. In December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.\n\u2022Weather and Construction Disruption - During the third quarter of 2021, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by natural disasters including Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the Lake Tahoe area. Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Lake Tahoe and Harvey's Lake Tahoe all experienced temporary closures which lasted slightly more than one week. Additionally, in late August 2020, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by Hurricane Laura, causing severe damage to Lake Charles, which will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be complete. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $44 million related to damaged fixed assets and remediation costs. The Company also recorded a gain of $21 million as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets.\n\u2022Caesars Sportsbook Launch and Rebranding - In connection with the launch and rebranding of the Caesars Sportsbook app during the year ended December 31, 2021, our Caesars Digital segment initiated a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and other media personalities. As new states and jurisdictions\nhave legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investment which has been executed through the marketing campaign and promotional incentives to establish ourselves as an industry leader.\n\u2022Post-Merger Synergies - We continue to identify operating and cost efficiencies, including savings from the purchasing power of the combined Caesars organization and targeted integrated marketing strategies, as well as the elimination of redundant costs such as accounting and professional expenses, certain payroll costs, and other corporate costs. As a result, we experienced margin improvements in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Las Vegas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td>5,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Digital </td> <td>337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed and Branded </td> <td>278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other (a)\n</td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,016) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,758) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (b):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Las Vegas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Digital </td> <td>(476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed and Branded </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other (a)\n</td> <td>(168) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) margin (c)\n</td> <td>(10.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(48.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n(a)Corporate and Other includes revenues related to certain licensing arrangements and various revenue sharing agreements.

In addition, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020. Further, many of our properties were operating under restrictive guidelines through the first half of 2021 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19 resulted in reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy as well as limitations on the operation of food and beverage outlets, live entertainment events, and conventions. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties have resumed certain operations, to the extent permitted, with the exception of Lake Charles which was severely damaged by Hurricane Laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casino and pari-mutuel commissions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and beverage </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td>438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>1,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>1,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs and other operating costs </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nCasino and pari-mutuel expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, marketing and promotions and gaming taxes. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations.\nCasino and pari-mutuel, hotel, food and beverage, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, the reopening of substantially all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the partial return of our workforce, and advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to the launch and rebranding of our Caesars Sportsbook app contributed\nto the increase noted. These increases were partially offset as the Company focused on labor efficiencies and post-merger synergies, as described above. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company managed increases in food costs and effectively improved margins by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses not directly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as the result of the reopening of all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. These increases were partially offset by a reduced cost structure implemented by the Company while our properties were temporarily closed due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, synergies associated with the combined companies from the Merger and the Company's focus on labor efficiencies and expense savings resulted in reductions to certain administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCorporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, annual bonus plans, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company's operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, corporate expenses increased primarily due to the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, payroll costs increased as compared to the prior year period due to performance-based incentives and higher costs in the labor market. These costs have been partially offset by a decline in the corporate headcount.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore.\nTransaction costs and other operating costs primarily included expenses related to the William Hill Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2021 and costs related to the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment charges in 2021 relate to the rebranding of certain of our properties. Impairment charges in 2020 relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from COVID-19 and agreements to sell properties whereby the carrying value exceeded the estimated net sales proceeds.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,295) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,202) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(286) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,093) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(916) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(236) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(197) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (loss) </td> <td>(198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (provision) for income taxes </td> <td>283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(132) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>(88) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(200.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense, net increased year over year as a result of the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Outstanding debt assumed, additional debt raised, and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction in interest expense due to the extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes, early extinguishment of the CRC Notes, partial repayment of the CEI Senior Notes and the repricing of CRC Incremental Term Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on extinguishment of debt was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the CRC Notes and CEI Senior Notes, the repricing of the CRC Incremental Term Loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to the payment of outstanding debt in connection with the Merger.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (loss) fluctuated year over year mainly due to a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes.\nThe effective tax rate was 22.3% for 2021, (8.2%) for 2020, and 35.2% for 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with VICI during the year. Such transactions did not occur in 2021.

Caesars Digital's sports betting handle, iGaming handle, and net revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period due to the acquisitions and the recent marketing launch of our new sportsbook. However, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by a sports betting hold percentage that was below our typical range. The low hold percentage was driven in part by increased odds and profit boosts, which are promotional enhancements that improve odds or wager payouts for customers. In addition, our hold percentage was negatively impacted by competitive pricing strategies and lower than typical hold in certain betting markets. iGaming hold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range.\nIn connection with the launch of our Caesars branded sportsbook and iGaming applications, we deployed a significant level of marketing spend to build brand awareness and acquire and retain customers.

Additionally, in connection with the closing of the sale of Caesars Southern Indiana on September 3, 2021, the Company and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians ( EBCI\u201d) extended their existing relationship by entering into a 10-year brand license agreement, with cancellation rights in exchange for a termination fee at the buyer's discretion following the fifth anniversary of the agreement, for the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana. Caesars Southern Indiana was previously reported within the Regional segment and subsequent to the sale, as a result of the license agreement relating to the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana, is reported within the Managed and Branded\nsegment.

Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, unrealized (gain) loss on investments and marketable securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the divestitures of properties, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss related to divestitures, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses such as sign-on and retention bonuses, business optimization expenses and transformation expenses, certain litigation awards and settlements, losses on inventory associated with properties temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, contract exit or termination costs, and certain regulatory settlements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our leases with affiliates of GLPI and VICI Properties Inc. and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.\nThe following table summarizes our Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with GAAP (unaudited):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>CEI </td> <td> </td> <td>Pre-Cons.

We make capital expenditures and perform continuing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. Our capital expenditure requirements for 2022 are expected to increase compared to prior periods as a result of increased expansion projects, the rebranding of certain properties, implementation and migration of states to our Liberty platform and continued investment into new markets with our Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming applications in our Caesars Digital segment.

Upon either party exercising their option, the Centaur properties would be sold at a price in accordance with the agreement and leased back to CEI in accordance to the pre-existing terms of the Regional Lease.\nThe sale of Caesars Southern Indiana to EBCI for $250 million was finalized on September 3, 2021 and as a result of the sale, Caesars' annual payments to VICI Properties under the Regional Lease decreased by $33 million and variable rent under the lease shall exclude net revenue attributable to Caesars Southern Indiana.\nOur VICI Leases are accounted for as a financing obligation and totaled $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements for additional information about our VICI Leases and related matters.\nGLPI Leases\nThe GLPI Master Lease, encompassing a portfolio of properties within the United States, provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land (including barges and riverboats), easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties. The GLPI Master Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term of 20 years (through September 2038), with four five-year renewals at the Company's option, (ii) annual land and building base rent of $24 million and $63 million, (iii) escalating provisions of building base rent equal to 101.25% of the rent for the preceding year for lease years five and six, 101.75% for lease years seven and eight and 102% for each lease year thereafter and (iv) relief from the operating, capital expenditure and financial covenants in the event of involuntary closures.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re Lease was entered into by the Company and GLPI, whereby the Company sold the real estate underlying Lumi\u00e8re to GLPI and leased back the property under a long-term financing obligation. The Lumi\u00e8re Lease, inclusive of all amendments, provides for (i) an initial term commencing on September 29, 2020 and ending on October 31, 2033, (ii) four five-year renewal options, (iii) annual rent payments of $23 million, (iv) escalation provisions commencing in lease year two equal to 101.25% of the rent for the preceding year for lease years two through five, 101.75% for lease years six and seven and 102% for each lease year thereafter, (v) maintaining a minimum of 1.20:1 adjusted revenue to rent ratio and (vi) certain relief under the financial covenant in the event of involuntary closures.\nThe GLPI Leases are accounted for as financing obligations and totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements for additional information about our GLPI Leases and related matters.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nWe are faced with certain contingencies, from time to time, involving litigation, claims, assessments, environmental remediation or compliance. These commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 11 to our Financial Statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, new competition among retail and online operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business\u201d which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality. When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Certain of our accounting policies, including those in connection with business combinations, certain fair value measurements, income taxes, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables, self-insurance reserves, and litigation, claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n\u2022the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and\n\u2022different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations.\nBy their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information gathered from customer behavior, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOur most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations,\u201d in the accounting for our acquisitions of Former Caesars, William Hill PLC, and our additional interest in Horseshoe Baltimore. It required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, which were determined using market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, Caesars Rewards acquired in the Merger, customer relationships and gaming rights. The fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach.\nAcquired trademarks, developed technology and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, technology, or loyalty program, we would have to make a stream of\npayments to a third party in return for the right to use their name, technology, or program. By virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the Company's ownership of the brand name, technology, or program.\nCustomer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach. The incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced.\nGaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value.\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach.\nThe fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period.\nReacquired rights were valued using the excess earnings method that reflects the present value of the future profit William Hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship as a component of the purchase consideration.\nFair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. The market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. The value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. Other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. The cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence.\nAssets and liabilities which are designated as held for sale on an acquisition date are also measured at fair value, utilizing similar market, income and cost approaches described above, based on the underlying asset class held for sale.\nCash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, future growth rates, and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value. These inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of COVID-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination, which may not be realized as projected. Certain assumptions, such as the effects of COVID-19, may be beyond our control.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use interest rate swaps, which are derivative instruments classified as hedging transactions, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. Derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value. The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes. Such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are limited to major banks and financial institutions. The fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty, if the derivative is an asset, or adjusted for the credit rating of the Company, if the derivative is a liability.\nSee Note 8 for more details regarding fair value measurements and", "summary": "- Caesars Entertainment Corporation reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December

Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. ( Isle\u201d or Isle of Capri\u201d) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, we completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation ( Former Caesars\u201d) pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from ERI\u201d to CZR\u201d.\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion (the William Hill Acquisition\u201d).\nWe currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 52 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 55,700 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,900 table games and approximately 47,700 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties' gaming operations, retail and online sports betting as well as online gaming, and we utilize hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 20 of our casinos and leased 26 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ( VICI\u201d) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease. In addition, we lease seven casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ( GLPI\u201d) pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the GLPI Master Lease\u201d) and a Lumi\u00e8re lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the GLPI Leases\u201d). Additionally, we lease the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino from a separate third party. See descriptions under the GLPI Leases\u201d and VICI Leases.\u201d\nWe also operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 states and domestic jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in five states. Our recently launched Caesars Sportsbook app operates on the Liberty platform, which we acquired in the William Hill Acquisition along with other technology platforms that we intend to migrate to the Liberty platform in the future, subject to required approvals. The map below illustrates Caesars Digital's presence as of December 31, 2021:\nSubsequent to December 31, 2021, we launched mobile sports betting on our Liberty platform in New York on January 8, 2022 and Louisiana on January 28, 2022 and went live with retail sports betting in Washington on February 10, 2022. We are also in the process of expanding our Caesars Digital footprint into other states in the near term.\nWe periodically divest of assets in order to raise capital or as a result of a determination that the assets are not core to our business. We also divested certain assets in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals related to closing of the Merger. A summary of recently completed and planned divestitures of our properties as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n\n____________________\n*Not meaningful.\n(a)Mountaineer, Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville were sold for aggregate consideration of $385 million.\n(b)Kansas City and Vicksburg were sold for aggregate consideration of $230 million.\n(c)The proceeds of this sale were split between the Company and VICI.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion on these key transactions and any applicable gain (loss) or impairment charges recorded.\nMerger and Acquisitions Related Activities\nAcquisition of William Hill\nOn September 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day \u00a31.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day \u00a3116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the Debt Financing\u201d). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The \u00a31.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement ( Interim Facilities Agreement\u201d) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, the Company repaid the \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full \u00a3116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of \u00a3700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, William Hill International\u201d), all of which are held for sale and reflected within\ndiscontinued operations. Certain investments acquired will be excluded from the held for sale group.\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately \u00a32.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, and other working capital adjustments, the Company expects to receive approximately \u00a3835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC ( Horseshoe Baltimore\u201d), a property which we also managed, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. We were subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and have consolidated the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. As a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our Managed and Branded segment. Operations following the consolidation event are presented within our Regional segment.\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets\n\u2022Diversification of the Company's domestic footprint\n\u2022Access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience\n\u2022Realization of significant identified synergies\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvestments and Partnerships\nNeoGames\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. ( NeoGames\u201d), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately 2 million shares of NeoGames common stock with a fair value of $60 million. The shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the Company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (Level 1). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss to the investment in NeoGames of $54 million, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nThe Stars Group/Flutter Entertainment\nIn November 2018, the Company entered into a 20-year agreement with The Stars Group Inc. ( TSG\u201d) pursuant to which we agreed to provide TSG with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to states in which our properties are located. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 1 million TSG common shares. The fair value of the shares received was deferred and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the 20-year agreement term. In addition, we received a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by TSG under our licenses. In December 2020, the Company sold a portion of these Flutter shares for net proceeds of $24 million.\nOn July 7, 2021, the Company sold all remaining Flutter shares for $9 million. The Company recorded a loss of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within Other income (loss) on our Statements of Operations.\nPompano Joint Venture\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies ( Cordish\u201d) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company's Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company's input and will submit it for the Company's review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash since the inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of December 31, 2021. We entered into a short-term lease agreement in February 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.\nWhile the Company holds a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction costs and other operating costs on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company's investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.\nReportable Segments\nSegment results in this MD&A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a significant market\u201d basis. Management views each of the Company's casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Prior to the William Hill Acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in three regionally-focused reportable segments: Las Vegas, Regional, and Managed, International, CIE, in addition to Corporate and Other.\nThe William Hill Acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, Caesars Interactive Entertainment CIE\u201d and now, inclusive of William Hill US, Caesars Digital\u201d) expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and iGaming gaming operations. As a result, the Company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. The Las Vegas and Regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former Managed, International and CIE reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments; Caesars Digital and Managed and Branded. Accordingly, our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See Item 2. Properties\u201d for listing of properties by segment.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company's sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. Refer to Reportable Segments\u201d above for a discussion of changes to the Company's reportable segments.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&A in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. In June 2021, the Indiana Gaming Commission amended its order that previously required the Company to sell a third casino asset in the state of Indiana. As a result, Horseshoe Hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. The assets and liabilities previously held\nfor sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. Additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented.\nKey Performance Metrics\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. Additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications.\nKey performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 14% to 23% of table game drop in the Las Vegas segment and 18% to 21% of table game drop in the Regional segment. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See Results of Operations\u201d section below. Complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Financial Results\nThe following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAcquisitions and Transaction Costs\n\u2022Acquisition of William Hill - On April 22, 2021, the Company consummated its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction of \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion. We recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International.\n\u2022Consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore - On August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore to approximately 75.8%. Prior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. As a result of the consolidation, the Company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation - The Merger closed on July 20, 2020. The Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations\n\u2022Divestitures and Discontinued Operations - See Overview\u201d section above for detail on properties divested or held for sale, including related discontinued operations.\nFinancing and Lease Transactions\n\u2022Debt Transactions - In connection with the Merger, we issued new notes, entered into a new credit agreement and assumed certain of Former Caesars indebtedness. In addition, we terminated previously outstanding credit agreements and discharged outstanding notes. During 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029, we repriced the Incremental CRC Term Loan, we fully converted the outstanding the 5% Convertible Notes, we purchased or redeemed the entire $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding CRC Notes of, and we purchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of CEI Senior Notes. As a result of these transactions, described more fully in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we experienced some interest savings subsequent to these transactions. Additionally, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $236 million and\n$197 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Operations.\n\u2022VICI Leases - Upon consummation of the Merger, CEI assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from VICI by Former Caesars under various lease agreements. We recorded interest expense of $1.1 billion and $519 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the VICI Leases. Our VICI Leases also contain annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index ( CPI\u201d), with a floor of 2%.\n\u2022GLPI Leases - We have accounted for the GLPI Leases as deferred financing obligations. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $111 million, $104 million and $99 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the GLPI Leases. Our GLPI Leases also contain an annual escalation provision based on stated rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.0% per year.\nOther Significant Factors\n\u2022COVID-19 Public Health Emergency - In January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified and has since spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\nWe experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although we have experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\n\u2022Impairment Charges - As a result of COVID-19, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our Regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. In December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.\n\u2022Weather and Construction Disruption - During the third quarter of 2021, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by natural disasters including Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the Lake Tahoe area. Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Lake Tahoe and Harvey's Lake Tahoe all experienced temporary closures which lasted slightly more than one week. Additionally, in late August 2020, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by Hurricane Laura, causing severe damage to Lake Charles, which will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be complete. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $44 million related to damaged fixed assets and remediation costs. The Company also recorded a gain of $21 million as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets.\n\u2022Caesars Sportsbook Launch and Rebranding - In connection with the launch and rebranding of the Caesars Sportsbook app during the year ended December 31, 2021, our Caesars Digital segment initiated a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and other media personalities. As new states and jurisdictions\nhave legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investment which has been executed through the marketing campaign and promotional incentives to establish ourselves as an industry leader.\n\u2022Post-Merger Synergies - We continue to identify operating and cost efficiencies, including savings from the purchasing power of the combined Caesars organization and targeted integrated marketing strategies, as well as the elimination of redundant costs such as accounting and professional expenses, certain payroll costs, and other corporate costs. As a result, we experienced margin improvements in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations:\n\n___________________\n(a)Corporate and Other includes revenues related to certain licensing arrangements and various revenue sharing agreements. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA includes corporate overhead costs, which consist of certain expenses, such as: payroll, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.\n(b)See the Supplemental Unaudited Presentation of Consolidated Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d)\u201d discussion later in this MD&A for a description of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA related margins.\n(c)Net income (loss) margin is calculated as net income (loss) divided by net revenues.\nConsolidated comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations: Comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are described below. A discussion of changes in our results of operations between year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\u201d of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The reclassification of Horseshoe Hammond from discontinued operations to continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020 did not result in material changes to the comparative analysis provided on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues were as follows:\n\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nConsolidated revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to recent acquisitions including the Merger on July 20, 2020, the William Hill Acquisition on April 22, 2021, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, offset by the divestiture of certain properties discussed above. In addition, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020. Further, many of our properties were operating under restrictive guidelines through the first half of 2021 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19 resulted in reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy as well as limitations on the operation of food and beverage outlets, live entertainment events, and conventions. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties have resumed certain operations, to the extent permitted, with the exception of Lake Charles which was severely damaged by Hurricane Laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows:\n\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nCasino and pari-mutuel expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, marketing and promotions and gaming taxes. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations.\nCasino and pari-mutuel, hotel, food and beverage, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, the reopening of substantially all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the partial return of our workforce, and advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to the launch and rebranding of our Caesars Sportsbook app contributed\nto the increase noted. These increases were partially offset as the Company focused on labor efficiencies and post-merger synergies, as described above. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company managed increases in food costs and effectively improved margins by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses not directly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as the result of the reopening of all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. These increases were partially offset by a reduced cost structure implemented by the Company while our properties were temporarily closed due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, synergies associated with the combined companies from the Merger and the Company's focus on labor efficiencies and expense savings resulted in reductions to certain administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCorporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, annual bonus plans, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company's operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, corporate expenses increased primarily due to the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, payroll costs increased as compared to the prior year period due to performance-based incentives and higher costs in the labor market. These costs have been partially offset by a decline in the corporate headcount.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore.\nTransaction costs and other operating costs primarily included expenses related to the William Hill Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2021 and costs related to the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment charges in 2021 relate to the rebranding of certain of our properties. Impairment charges in 2020 relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from COVID-19 and agreements to sell properties whereby the carrying value exceeded the estimated net sales proceeds.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was as follows:\n\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense, net increased year over year as a result of the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Outstanding debt assumed, additional debt raised, and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction in interest expense due to the extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes, early extinguishment of the CRC Notes, partial repayment of the CEI Senior Notes and the repricing of CRC Incremental Term Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on extinguishment of debt was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the CRC Notes and CEI Senior Notes, the repricing of the CRC Incremental Term Loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to the payment of outstanding debt in connection with the Merger.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (loss) fluctuated year over year mainly due to a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes.\nThe effective tax rate was 22.3% for 2021, (8.2%) for 2020, and 35.2% for 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with VICI during the year. Such transactions did not occur in 2021. Refer to Item 8. - Note 17 for the effective income tax rate reconciliation.\nSegment comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nLas Vegas Segment\n\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nLas Vegas segment's net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of the Merger and reopening of all of our Las Vegas properties in accordance with state and local regulations as of December 31, 2021. In June 2021, convention and entertainment venues began to reopen as COVID-19 capacity restrictions were lifted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our reopened properties in the Las Vegas segment experienced an increase in net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA compared to Former Caesars' prior year results as all properties were temporarily closed for a portion of 2020. Slot win percentage in Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range and hotel occupancy trended upward compared to 2020. Additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the Las Vegas segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. These positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to COVID-19.\nRegional Segment\n\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nRegional segment's net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period as a result of the Merger and consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. The increase was slightly offset by divestitures of certain properties and closures of certain properties due to Hurricane Ida and the Caldor fire. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCaesars Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is referred to as the Company,\u201d CEI,\u201d Caesars,\u201d or the Registrant,\u201d and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as we,\u201d us\u201d or our.\u201d\nWe also refer to (i) our Consolidated Financial Statements as our Financial Statements,\u201d (ii) our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) as our Statements of Operations,\u201d (iii) our Consolidated Balance Sheets as our Balance Sheets,\u201d and (iv) our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as our Statements of Cash Flows.\u201d References to numbered Notes\u201d refer to Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nThe statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors-CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d of this report.\nObjective\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to be a narrative explanation of the financial statements and other statistical data that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements to enhance an investor's understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Our objectives are: (i) to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that will enable investors to see the Company through the eyes of management; (ii) to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and (iii) to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flows so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. ( Isle\u201d or Isle of Capri\u201d) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, we completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation ( Former Caesars\u201d) pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from ERI\u201d to CZR\u201d.\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion (the William Hill Acquisition\u201d).\nWe currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 52 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 55,700 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,900 table games and approximately 47,700 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties' gaming operations, retail and online sports betting as well as online gaming, and we utilize hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 20 of our casinos and leased 26 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ( VICI\u201d) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease. In addition, we lease seven casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ( GLPI\u201d) pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the GLPI Master Lease\u201d) and a Lumi\u00e8re lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the GLPI Leases\u201d). Additionally, we lease the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino from a separate third party. See descriptions under the GLPI Leases\u201d and VICI Leases.\u201d\nWe also operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 states and domestic jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in five states. Our recently launched Caesars Sportsbook app operates on the Liberty platform, which we acquired in the William Hill Acquisition along with other technology platforms that we intend to migrate to the Liberty platform in the future, subject to required approvals. The map below illustrates Caesars Digital's presence as of December 31, 2021:\nSubsequent to December 31, 2021, we launched mobile sports betting on our Liberty platform in New York on January 8, 2022 and Louisiana on January 28, 2022 and went live with retail sports betting in Washington on February 10, 2022. We are also in the process of expanding our Caesars Digital footprint into other states in the near term.\nWe periodically divest of assets in order to raise capital or as a result of a determination that the assets are not core to our business. We also divested certain assets in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals related to closing of the Merger. A summary of recently completed and planned divestitures of our properties as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Property </td> <td> </td> <td>Date Sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sales Price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Presque Isle Downs & Casino ( Presque\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>January 11, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$179 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin ( Nemacolin\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>March 8, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort ( Mountaineer\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Isle Casino Cape Girardeau ( Cape Girardeau\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville ( Caruthersville\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 6, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Isle of Capri Casino Kansas City ( Kansas City\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg ( Vicksburg\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>July 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Eldorado Resort Casino Shreveport ( Eldorado Shreveport\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 23, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$140 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>MontBleu Casino Resort & Spa ( MontBleu\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>April 6, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$15 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Tropicana Evansville ( Evansville\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>June 3, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$480 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel ( Baton Rouge\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Harrah's Reno </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$42 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Bally's Atlantic City </td> <td> </td> <td>November 18, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$25 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Harrah's Louisiana Downs </td> <td> </td> <td>November 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$22 million (c) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td> </td> <td>Caesars Southern Indiana </td> <td> </td> <td>September 3, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$250 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>Emerald Resort & Casino </td> <td> </td> <td>July 16, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>Caesars Entertainment UK </td> <td> </td> <td>July 16, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>William Hill International </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a32.2 billion\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n*Not meaningful.\n(a)Mountaineer, Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville were sold for aggregate consideration of $385 million.\n(b)Kansas City and Vicksburg were sold for aggregate consideration of $230 million.\n(c)The proceeds of this sale were split between the Company and VICI.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion on these key transactions and any applicable gain (loss) or impairment charges recorded.\nMerger and Acquisitions Related Activities\nAcquisition of William Hill\nOn September 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition for \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day \u00a31.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day \u00a3116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the Debt Financing\u201d). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The \u00a31.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement ( Interim Facilities Agreement\u201d) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, the Company repaid the \u00a3503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full \u00a3116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of \u00a3700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, William Hill International\u201d), all of which are held for sale and reflected within\ndiscontinued operations. Certain investments acquired will be excluded from the held for sale group.\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately \u00a32.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, and other working capital adjustments, the Company expects to receive approximately \u00a3835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC ( Horseshoe Baltimore\u201d), a property which we also managed, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. We were subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and have consolidated the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. As a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our Managed and Branded segment. Operations following the consolidation event are presented within our Regional segment.\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Creation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets\n\u2022Diversification of the Company's domestic footprint\n\u2022Access to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience\n\u2022Realization of significant identified synergies\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvestments and Partnerships\nNeoGames\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. ( NeoGames\u201d), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately 2 million shares of NeoGames common stock with a fair value of $60 million. The shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the Company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (Level 1). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss to the investment in NeoGames of $54 million, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nThe Stars Group/Flutter Entertainment\nIn November 2018, the Company entered into a 20-year agreement with The Stars Group Inc. ( TSG\u201d) pursuant to which we agreed to provide TSG with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to states in which our properties are located. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 1 million TSG common shares. The fair value of the shares received was deferred and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the 20-year agreement term. In addition, we received a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by TSG under our licenses. In December 2020, the Company sold a portion of these Flutter shares for net proceeds of $24 million.\nOn July 7, 2021, the Company sold all remaining Flutter shares for $9 million. The Company recorded a loss of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within Other income (loss) on our Statements of Operations.\nPompano Joint Venture\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies ( Cordish\u201d) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company's Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company's input and will submit it for the Company's review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash since the inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of December 31, 2021. We entered into a short-term lease agreement in February 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.\nWhile the Company holds a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction costs and other operating costs on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company's investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.\nReportable Segments\nSegment results in this MD&A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a significant market\u201d basis. Management views each of the Company's casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Prior to the William Hill Acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in three regionally-focused reportable segments: Las Vegas, Regional, and Managed, International, CIE, in addition to Corporate and Other.\nThe William Hill Acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, Caesars Interactive Entertainment CIE\u201d and now, inclusive of William Hill US, Caesars Digital\u201d) expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and iGaming gaming operations. As a result, the Company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. The Las Vegas and Regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former Managed, International and CIE reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments; Caesars Digital and Managed and Branded. Accordingly, our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See Item 2. Properties\u201d for listing of properties by segment.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company's sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. Refer to Reportable Segments\u201d above for a discussion of changes to the Company's reportable segments.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&A in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. In June 2021, the Indiana Gaming Commission amended its order that previously required the Company to sell a third casino asset in the state of Indiana. As a result, Horseshoe Hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. The assets and liabilities previously held\nfor sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. Additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented.\nKey Performance Metrics\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. Additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications.\nKey performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 14% to 23% of table game drop in the Las Vegas segment and 18% to 21% of table game drop in the Regional segment. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See Results of Operations\u201d section below. Complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Financial Results\nThe following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAcquisitions and Transaction Costs\n\u2022Acquisition of William Hill - On April 22, 2021, the Company consummated its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction of \u00a32.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion. We recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International.\n\u2022Consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore - On August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore to approximately 75.8%. Prior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. As a result of the consolidation, the Company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation - The Merger closed on July 20, 2020. The Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations\n\u2022Divestitures and Discontinued Operations - See Overview\u201d section above for detail on properties divested or held for sale, including related discontinued operations.\nFinancing and Lease Transactions\n\u2022Debt Transactions - In connection with the Merger, we issued new notes, entered into a new credit agreement and assumed certain of Former Caesars indebtedness. In addition, we terminated previously outstanding credit agreements and discharged outstanding notes. During 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029, we repriced the Incremental CRC Term Loan, we fully converted the outstanding the 5% Convertible Notes, we purchased or redeemed the entire $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding CRC Notes of, and we purchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of CEI Senior Notes. As a result of these transactions, described more fully in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we experienced some interest savings subsequent to these transactions. Additionally, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $236 million and\n$197 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Operations.\n\u2022VICI Leases - Upon consummation of the Merger, CEI assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from VICI by Former Caesars under various lease agreements. We recorded interest expense of $1.1 billion and $519 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the VICI Leases. Our VICI Leases also contain annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index ( CPI\u201d), with a floor of 2%.\n\u2022GLPI Leases - We have accounted for the GLPI Leases as deferred financing obligations. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $111 million, $104 million and $99 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the GLPI Leases. Our GLPI Leases also contain an annual escalation provision based on stated rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.0% per year.\nOther Significant Factors\n\u2022COVID-19 Public Health Emergency - In January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified and has since spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\nWe experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although we have experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\n\u2022Impairment Charges - As a result of COVID-19, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our Regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. In December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.\n\u2022Weather and Construction Disruption - During the third quarter of 2021, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by natural disasters including Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the Lake Tahoe area. Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Lake Tahoe and Harvey's Lake Tahoe all experienced temporary closures which lasted slightly more than one week. Additionally, in late August 2020, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by Hurricane Laura, causing severe damage to Lake Charles, which will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be complete. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $44 million related to damaged fixed assets and remediation costs. The Company also recorded a gain of $21 million as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets.\n\u2022Caesars Sportsbook Launch and Rebranding - In connection with the launch and rebranding of the Caesars Sportsbook app during the year ended December 31, 2021, our Caesars Digital segment initiated a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and other media personalities. As new states and jurisdictions\nhave legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investment which has been executed through the marketing campaign and promotional incentives to establish ourselves as an industry leader.\n\u2022Post-Merger Synergies - We continue to identify operating and cost efficiencies, including savings from the purchasing power of the combined Caesars organization and targeted integrated marketing strategies, as well as the elimination of redundant costs such as accounting and professional expenses, certain payroll costs, and other corporate costs. As a result, we experienced margin improvements in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Las Vegas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td>5,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Digital </td> <td>337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed and Branded </td> <td>278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other (a)\n</td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,016) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,758) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (b):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Las Vegas </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>719 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Digital </td> <td>(476) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed and Branded </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other (a)\n</td> <td>(168) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,990 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) margin (c)\n</td> <td>(10.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(48.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n(a)Corporate and Other includes revenues related to certain licensing arrangements and various revenue sharing agreements.

In addition, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020. Further, many of our properties were operating under restrictive guidelines through the first half of 2021 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19 resulted in reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy as well as limitations on the operation of food and beverage outlets, live entertainment events, and conventions. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties have resumed certain operations, to the extent permitted, with the exception of Lake Charles which was severely damaged by Hurricane Laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casino and pari-mutuel commissions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food and beverage </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel </td> <td>438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>1,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>1,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs and other operating costs </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nCasino and pari-mutuel expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, marketing and promotions and gaming taxes. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations.\nCasino and pari-mutuel, hotel, food and beverage, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, the reopening of substantially all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the partial return of our workforce, and advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to the launch and rebranding of our Caesars Sportsbook app contributed\nto the increase noted. These increases were partially offset as the Company focused on labor efficiencies and post-merger synergies, as described above. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company managed increases in food costs and effectively improved margins by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses not directly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as the result of the reopening of all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. These increases were partially offset by a reduced cost structure implemented by the Company while our properties were temporarily closed due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, synergies associated with the combined companies from the Merger and the Company's focus on labor efficiencies and expense savings resulted in reductions to certain administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCorporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, annual bonus plans, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company's operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, corporate expenses increased primarily due to the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, payroll costs increased as compared to the prior year period due to performance-based incentives and higher costs in the labor market. These costs have been partially offset by a decline in the corporate headcount.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore.\nTransaction costs and other operating costs primarily included expenses related to the William Hill Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2021 and costs related to the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment charges in 2021 relate to the rebranding of certain of our properties. Impairment charges in 2020 relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from COVID-19 and agreements to sell properties whereby the carrying value exceeded the estimated net sales proceeds.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,295) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,202) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(286) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,093) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(916) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(236) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(197) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (loss) </td> <td>(198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (provision) for income taxes </td> <td>283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(132) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td>(88) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(200.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\n* Not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense, net increased year over year as a result of the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Outstanding debt assumed, additional debt raised, and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction in interest expense due to the extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes, early extinguishment of the CRC Notes, partial repayment of the CEI Senior Notes and the repricing of CRC Incremental Term Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on extinguishment of debt was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the CRC Notes and CEI Senior Notes, the repricing of the CRC Incremental Term Loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to the payment of outstanding debt in connection with the Merger.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (loss) fluctuated year over year mainly due to a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes.\nThe effective tax rate was 22.3% for 2021, (8.2%) for 2020, and 35.2% for 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with VICI during the year. Such transactions did not occur in 2021.

of December 31, 2021. In June 2021, convention and entertainment venues began to reopen as COVID-19 capacity restrictions were lifted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our reopened properties in the Las Vegas segment experienced an increase in net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA compared to Former Caesars' prior year results as all properties were temporarily closed for a portion of 2020. Slot win percentage in Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range and hotel occupancy trended upward compared to 2020. Additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the Las Vegas segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. These positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to COVID-19.\nRegional Segment\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
