MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes thereto. This Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See section heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOutlook\nOverview\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a strategic national U.S. Uranium Reserve program, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of our production facilities, including the currently operating White Mesa Mill, as well as the Alta Mesa ISR Facility, the Nichols Ranch ISR Facility, the La Sal Complex and Pinyon Plain Mine, which are currently on standby. The Company may commence such activities, prior to the implementation of all program details, recognizing that there can be no guarantee that the program details will be satisfactory and that the timing and outcome of this process is therefore uncertain, or as market conditions may warrant. Alternatively, the Company may defer commencing any such activities until further clarification is obtained, or as market conditions otherwise warrant. No decisions on any project-specific actions have been made at this time.\nDuring 2021 the Company expects to recover uranium at the White Mesa Mill from pond-returns and from alternate feed materials. The vanadium pond-return campaign that was conducted in 2019 was brought to a close in early 2020. The Company also expects to produce mixed REE carbonate from natural monazite ore during 2021, subject to successful ramp-up. The Company does not plan to extract and/or recover any amounts of uranium of any significance from its Nichols Ranch Project in 2021, which was placed on standby in the second quarter of 2020 due to the depletion of its existing wellfields. Uranium recovery is expected to be maintained at reduced levels, as a result of current uranium market conditions, until such time when market conditions improve sufficiently. Until such time that improvement in uranium market conditions is observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into, the Company expects to defer further wellfield development at its Nichols Ranch Project and maintain that project on standby. In addition, the Company expects to keep the Alta Mesa Project and its conventional mining properties on standby.\nThe Company is also seeking new sources of revenue, including its emerging REE business, as well as new sources of alternate feed materials and new fee processing opportunities at the White Mesa Mill that can be processed under existing market conditions (i.e., without reliance on current uranium sales prices). The Company will also continue its support of U.S. governmental activities to support the U.S. uranium mining industry, including the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve. In addition, the Company is in discussions to potentially sell certain of its non-core properties, although there are currently no binding offers, and there can be no assurance that a sale will be completed or that we will be successful in completing a sale on acceptable terms. The Company will evaluate additional acquisition and disposition opportunities that may arise.\nExtraction and Recovery Activities Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 196,500 pounds of U3O8, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company also recovered approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 for its own account. The Company expects to produce no vanadium. In 2021, the Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons of total rare earth oxides ( TREO\u201d).\nThe Company has strategically opted not to enter into any uranium sales commitments for 2021. Therefore, subject to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, all 2021 uranium production is expected to be added to existing inventories, which inventories are expected to total approximately 720,000 to 750,000 pounds of U3O8 at year-end. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or improvements in general market conditions, both ISR and conventional uranium extraction and/or recovery is expected to continue to be maintained at reduced levels until such time that improvements in uranium market conditions are observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into. All V2O5 inventory is expected to be sold on the spot market if prices rise significantly above current levels, but otherwise maintained in inventory. The Company expects to sell all or a portion of its mixed REE carbonate to global separation facilities and/or to stockpile it for future separation at the Mill or elsewhere.\nISR Activities\nWe extracted and recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Nichols Ranch Project for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company expects to produce insignificant quantities of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 from Nichols Ranch.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Nichols Ranch wellfields had nine header houses that previously extracted uranium, and which are now depleted. Until such time as improvement in uranium market conditions is observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured, the Company expects to defer development of further header houses at its Nichols Ranch Project. The Company currently holds 34 fully-permitted, undeveloped wellfields at Nichols Ranch, including four additional wellfields at the Nichols Ranch wellfields, 22 wellfields at the adjacent Jane Dough wellfields, and eight wellfields at the Hank Project, which is fully permitted to be constructed as a satellite facility to the Nichols Ranch Plant.\nThe Company expects to continue to keep the Alta Mesa Project on standby until such time as improvements in uranium market conditions are observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured.\nConventional Activities\nConventional Extraction and Recovery Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the White Mesa Mill recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5. The Mill also focused on developing its REE recovery business. During 2021, the Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 at the White Mesa Mill, including uranium recovered through the processing of REE- and uranium-bearing natural monazite ore. The Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the Mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons TREO. The Company currently has approximately 127,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in stockpiled alternate feed material and ore inventory that can be recovered in the future for the U.S. uranium reserve or as general market conditions warrant. In addition, there remains an estimated 1.5-3 million pounds of solubilized recoverable V2O5 inventory remaining in the tailings facility awaiting future recovery, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis whereby uranium and/or vanadium recovery is scheduled as mill feed, cash needs, contract requirements, and/or market conditions may warrant. The Company currently expects that planned uranium production from alternate feed materials, processing natural monazite ore for the recovery of uranium and REEs, and receipt of uranium-bearing materials from mine cleanup activities will keep the Mill in operation through 2021 and beyond. The Company is also actively pursuing opportunities to process additional sources of natural monazite ore, new and additional alternate feed material sources, and new and additional low-grade ore from third parties in connection with various uranium clean-up requirements. Successful results from these activities would allow the Mill to extend operations well into 2022 and beyond.\nHowever, if at any time the Company is unable to justify full operation of the Mill, the Company would place uranium, REE and/or vanadium recovery activities at the Mill on standby at that time. While on standby, the Mill would continue to dry and package material from the Nichols Ranch Plant, if operating, and continue to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future milling campaigns. Each future milling campaign would be subject to receipt of sufficient mill feed and resulting cash flow that would allow the Company to operate the Mill on a profitable basis or to recover all or a portion of the Mill's standby costs.\nConventional Standby, Permitting and Evaluation Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, standby and environmental compliance activities occurred at the Pinyon Plain Project. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, during 2021, the Company plans to continue carrying out engineering, metallurgical testing, procurement and construction management activities at its Pinyon Plain Project. The timing of the Company's plans to extract and process mineralized materials from this project will be based on the results of this additional evaluation work, along with market conditions, available financing, sales requirements, and/or permits required for copper recovery at the Mill.\nThe Company is selectively advancing certain permits at its other major conventional uranium projects, such as the Roca Honda Project, a large, high-grade conventional project in New Mexico. The Company will also maintain required permits at the Company's conventional projects, including the Sheep Mountain Project, La Sal Complex, and the Whirlwind mines. In\naddition, the Company will continue to evaluate the Bullfrog Property at its Henry Mountains Project. Expenditures for certain of these projects have been adjusted to coincide with expected dates of price recoveries based on the Company's forecasts. All of these projects serve as important pipeline assets for the Company's future conventional production capabilities, as market conditions warrant. The Company is also in discussions to potentially sell the Tony M, Daneros, Rim and other non-core conventional assets.\nUranium Sales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed no sales of uranium. The Company currently has no remaining contracts, and therefore all existing uranium inventory and future production is fully unhedged to future uranium price changes.\nVanadium Sales\nDuring 2020, the Company completed no sales of vanadium. The Company expects to sell finished vanadium product when justified into the metallurgical industry, as well as other markets that demand a higher purity product, including the aerospace, chemical, and potentially the vanadium battery industries. The Company expects to sell to a diverse group of customers in order to maximize revenues and profits. The vanadium produced in the recent pond return campaign was a high-purity vanadium product of 99.6%-99.7% V2O5. The Company believes there may be opportunities to sell certain quantities of this high-purity material at a premium to reported spot prices. The Company may also retain vanadium product in inventory for future sale, depending on vanadium spot prices and general market conditions.\nRare Earth Sales\nThe Company expects to commence commercial production of a mixed REE carbonate in 2021. Subject to successfully ramping-up production of a salable product during 2021, the Company expects to sell some or all of this intermediate REE product to Neo's Silmet separation facility in Europe and potentially to other REE separation facilities outside the U.S. To the extent not sold, the Company expects to stockpile mixed REE carbonate at the Mill for future separation and other downstream REE processing at the Mill or elsewhere. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above and Update on Rare Earth Element Initiative,\u201d below.\nThe Company also continues to pursue new sources of revenue, including additional alternate feed materials and other sources of feed for the White Mesa Mill.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company continues to evaluate the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business objectives, projections and workforce. Due to the current uncertainty, the Company is continuing its cost-cutting measures, while retaining the operational readiness of the Company's core production assets. The Company is also continuing to work to secure U.S. government support for U.S. uranium miners. To date, although the Company has made operational adjustments since the onset of the pandemic to ensure its workforce remains protected, the Company has not been required to shut down any operations as a result of COVID-19. None of these operational adjustments have been material to the Company. The Company has evaluated any potential shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of COVID-19, and has determined that any such shutdown could be accommodated by the Company in a manner consistent with a typical shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of depressed commodity prices. Management believes the Company is well-capitalized and will be able to withstand facility shutdowns or depressed share prices as a result of COVID-19 for at least the next twelve months.\nBought Deal Financing\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of Common Shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 Common Shares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering.\nFull Redemption of Convertible Debentures\nOn July 14, 2020, the Company redeemed Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Cdn$20.86 million Convertible Debentures then outstanding for approximately $7.78 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding July 14, 2020. On October 6, 2020, the Company redeemed the remaining Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Convertible Debentures then outstanding for\napproximately $7.82 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding October 6, 2020. As a result of the final redemption, no Convertible Debentures are outstanding or subject to the terms of the Indenture, and the Convertible Debentures have ceased to be listed on the TSX. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements: Loans and Borrowings.\u201d The Company decided to redeem all of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity because the U.S.-Canada currency exchange rate was favorable, the Company had sufficient cash available, and the Company avoided approximately US$0.46 million in interest payments in 2020 by doing so. By proactively managing its outstanding indebtedness in this way, the Company was able to redeem the Convertible Debentures on the Company's own timing and terms and with minimal market disruption. The Company currently has no other remaining short- or long-term debt.\nAgreement to Acquire Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) Borehole Logging Technology and Equipment\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire from GeoInstruments Logging LLC ( GIL\u201d) all of its Prompt Fission Neutron ( PFN\u201d) technology and equipment, including all of its related intellectual property, giving Energy Fuels the exclusive right to use, license, and service this particular PFN technology globally. PFN is critical to successful uranium production particularly from many in situ recovery ( ISR\u201d) deposits, as it more accurately measures downhole in-situ U3O8 ore grade versus traditional Total Gamma and Spectral Gamma methods. On July 31, 2020, the parties closed the transaction and all such equipment and technology was transferred to the Company.\nThe PFN equipment and technology acquired by Energy Fuels includes: four (4) PFN tools; nine (9) gamma tools; two (2) low-mileage, heavy-duty logging trucks with logging and associated equipment; power supplies, computers, communication, and other technology; and all associated intellectual property, and the sole right to utilize and license the acquired PFN technology globally. The total consideration paid by Energy Fuels to GIL was $0.5 million cash.\nEnergy Fuels currently has some PFN equipment in various states of repair, which it has used for its mining operations in the past, as do other companies in the U.S. and around the world. With the acquisition of this additional PFN equipment and technology from GIL, Energy Fuels is not only able to utilize the additional equipment to ramp-up production from its ISR properties more quickly and efficiently in the event of improved market conditions, but has also secured the ability to service, repair and maintain PFN equipment currently held by the Company and others, as well as license this technology to others in the future.\nUpdate on Rare Earth Element Initiative\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company announced its intent to enter the REE market following several months of review and testing, including discussions with various technical experts and the U.S. government. The U.S. government is actively seeking a domestic source of REE minerals, which are needed for national defense among other applications.\nREEs are a group of 17 chemical elements (the 15 elements in the lanthanum series, plus yttrium and scandium) that have a variety of industrial, energy, military and defense uses, including automotive components, communications technology, clean energy production, consumer electronics, defense systems, advanced magnets, lasers and numerous other applications. According to a 2017 report by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS\u201d), China has controlled more than 90% of the global supply of REEs since the late-1990s and has placed restrictions on REE exports since 2010.\nEnergy Fuels believes the White Mesa Mill is uniquely suited to potentially receive and process a number of different types of ores for the recovery of REEs (along with uranium), which, if achievable on a commercial basis and subject to the receipt of any required license or permit amendments, would eliminate the current need to ship those ores to China for processing. If successful, the Company expects to offer customers tolling or processing arrangements at the White Mesa Mill.\nOn May 21, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into consulting agreements with Constantine Karayannopoulos and Brock O'Kelley, two REE industry experts who each have decades of experience producing commercially viable rare earth products, to aid in the development and implementation of commercial and technical REE strategies for the Company's REE program. A chemical engineer by training with more than 25 years of experience in the rare earth industry, Mr. Karayannopoulos, was at the time of the announcement Chair of Neo Performance Materials (TSX:NEO) ( Neo\u201d), one of the world's leading producers of advanced industrial materials, including rare earth-based engineered products, for multiple global markets. Mr. O'Kelley played a key role in the operation of the Mountain Pass, California rare earth processing facility during the 1990s and 2000s. Both are industry veterans with extensive knowledge of REE processing facility design, start-up, operations, and downstream value-added manufacturing of advanced REE products. On July 7, 2020, Mr. Karayannopoulos was reappointed as President and CEO of Neo. As a result of his new executive roles with Neo, his consulting agreement with the Company ended on August 6, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the Company entered into a non-exclusive Letter of Intent with Neo, under which: (i) Mr. Karayannopoulos and other Neo personnel will continue to assist Energy Fuels in developing commercial and technical aspects of the Company's REE strategy, including the potential production of a rare earth oxide concentrate at the Mill that can be sold to REE separation facilities; and (ii) the Company and Neo will work together toward potentially creating\na longer term mutually beneficial relationship, which may involve commitments to buy and sell all or a portion of the REE concentrate produced at the Mill or other commercial arrangements.\nOn December 14, 2020, the Company announced it entered into a three-year supply agreement with The Chemours Company (NYSE: CC) ( Chemours\u201d) to acquire a minimum of 2,500 tons per year of natural monazite sands, one of the highest-grade REE ores in the world, from Chemours' Offerman Mineral Sand Plant located in Georgia. The Company expects to process this monazite at the Mill, starting in 2021, to recover the contained uranium and to produce a marketable mixed REE carbonate as a step toward re-establishing a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company and Neo jointly announced that they had entered into an agreement in principle, subject to completion of definitive agreements, under which Energy Fuels will process natural monazite sands into an REE Carbonate beginning in March or April 2021 and ship a portion of that production to Neo's rare earth separations facility in Sillam\u00e4e, Estonia (\"Silmet\"). Neo will then process the REE Carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth-based advanced materials. Silmet is the only operational rare earth separations facility in Europe and has been separating rare earths into commercial value-added products for more than 50 years. Implementation of this initiative is subject to successful ramp-up to commercial-scale operations, execution of definitive agreements, and optimization of the companies' production processes.\nUpon a successful ramp-up of this program, the Company will be the first U.S. company in several years to produce a marketable mixed REE concentrate ready for separation on a commercial scale. The Company estimates that the amount of REEs contained in the monazite sands to be supplied by Chemours will equal close to 10% of total current U.S. REE demand, as contained in end-use products.\nRemoval and recovery of the uranium and other radionuclides from rare earth ores is a key aspect of Energy Fuels' value proposition, as many REE separation and recovery facilities are not able to handle those radionuclides from a technical or regulatory standpoint. The White Mesa Mill has a 40-year history of responsibly handling, processing and recycling uranium bearing materials. Therefore, it has the potential to provide a crucial link in a commercially viable U.S. REE supply chain. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above.\nProposed Establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group Update\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company participated in the joint filing of a Petition for Relief under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten National Security (the Petition\u201d). The Petition describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China are believed to represent a threat to U.S. national security.\nOn July 18, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce ( DOC\u201d) initiated an investigation in response to the Petition (the Section 232 Investigation\u201d).\nOn April 14, 2019, the DOC completed the Section 232 Investigation, and the Secretary of Commerce submitted a report to the former President of the United States containing his findings (the Section 232 Report\u201d).\nOn July 12, 2019, in response to the Section 232 Report, former President Trump issued a memorandum, where he stated that I agree with the Secretary that the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.\u201d In order to address the concerns identified by the Secretary regarding domestic uranium production and to ensure a comprehensive review of the entire domestic nuclear supply chain,\u201d former President Trump formed the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group (the Working Group\u201d) to examine the current state of domestic nuclear fuel production to reinvigorate the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, consistent with United States national security and nonproliferation goals.\u201d Former President Trump instructed the Working Group to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production,\u201d and to submit a report to him within 90 days setting forth the Working Group's findings and making recommendations to further enable domestic nuclear fuel production if needed.\u201d\nOn February 10, 2020, the federal executive Budget for fiscal year 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021) (the Budget\u201d) was published. The Budget Supports Nuclear Fuel Cycle Capabilities,\u201d and states that [o]n July 12, 2019, the [former] President determined that \u2018...the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.' The Budget establishes a U.S. Uranium Reserve to provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.\u201d Table 25-1 of the Budget sought congressional appropriations of $150 million per year over the next 10 years (totaling $1.5 billion over that time frame) for domestic uranium purchases. For fiscal 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021), the Budget sought an appropriation of $150 million, to remain available until expended,\u201d as the appropriation for the first year of the 10-year program. The Budget further stated that Establishing a Uranium Reserve provides assurance of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption and\nsupports strategic U.S. fuel cycle capabilities. This action addresses immediate challenges to the production of domestic uranium and reflects the Administration's Nuclear Fuel Working Group (NFWG) priorities. The NFWG will continue to evaluate issues related to uranium supply chain and fuel supply.\u201d\nOn April 23, 2020, the Working Group published its report: Restoring America's Competitive Nuclear Energy Advantage: A strategy to assure U.S. national security. This comprehensive strategy sought to revive and strengthen U.S. nuclear fuel capabilities, starting with uranium mining, with the goals of supporting U.S. energy and national security, preventing geopolitical adversaries (particularly those in Russia) from using their nuclear capabilities to influence the U.S. and the world, and promoting global non-proliferation objectives and nuclear safety. The report stated that the clear outcome of the Working Group's efforts is confirmation that it is in the nation's national security interests to preserve the assets and investments of the entire U.S. nuclear enterprise and to revitalize the sector to regain U.S. global nuclear leadership.\u201d The report recommended government purchases to establish a Uranium Reserve, as contemplated by the Budget, and other actions aimed to strengthen the entire nuclear fuel cycle.\nOn December 27, 2020, the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill, which includes $75 million for the proposed establishment of a strategic U.S. Uranium Reserve, was signed into law by the United States Congress. This key funding opens the door for the U.S. government to purchase domestically-produced uranium to guard against potential commercial and national security risks presented by the country's near-total reliance on foreign imports of uranium. The Company stands ready to benefit from this program through sales out of its existing uranium inventories and future production from its mines and facilities. However, because the U.S. Uranium Reserve has yet to be established at this time, the details of implementation of activities pursuant to the new law have not yet been defined. As a result, there can be no certainty as to the outcome of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, if any, including the process for and details of its development, and any resulting support for the Company's ongoing and planned activities, or for any further evaluations of the Working Group.\nIf the uranium and vanadium markets or general market conditions do not improve, whether as a result of the establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or otherwise, the Company may further reduce its operational activities as required in order to minimize its cash expenditures while preserving its core asset base for increased production in the future, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe Company's Plans in Response to the Proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of its production facilities, subject to general market conditions. No decisions on any project-specific actions to be taken in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve have been made at this time.\nRenewal of the Russian Suspension Agreement\nOn September 14, 2020, the DOC announced that it had obtained Russia's agreement to extend limits on uranium imports into the U.S. from Russia through 2040 under an extended Russian Suspension Agreement. This is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry. The DOC won important concessions from Russia, including lower quotas starting in the mid-2020s, allowing only a portion of the quotas to be used for the sale of U3O8 and conversion into the U.S., and strict controls on Russian enrichment service contracts, reducing U.S. dependence on Russian uranium in the long term. While the extended Russian Suspension Agreement is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry, it does not supplant the need for the establishment of a Uranium Reserve as proposed in the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill and as recommended by the Working Group.\nManagement Streamlining\nOn August 20, 2020, the Company announced that it was making a number of changes to its management team in order to reduce costs, flatten the organizational structure, and focus on the ongoing growth of a new generation of U.S. uranium and REE professionals, including the following, effective September 1, 2020: (a) Mr. Scott Bakken, former Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs, became the Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, responsible for permitting and regulatory matters relating to all of the Company's operations, both conventional and ISR, and also for overall worker health and safety matters at the Company; (b) Mr. Bernard Bonifas, former Director, Wyoming Operations, became the Director, ISR Operations, responsible for all of the Company's ISR operations, including its Nichols Ranch ISR project in Wyoming and its Alta Mesa ISR project in Texas; (c) Ms. Sarai Luksch, CPA, joined the Company as Controller; (d) Ms. Dee Ann Nazarenus, former Director, Human Resources & Administration, became the Vice President, Human Resources & Administration, responsible for planning, developing, organizing, implementing, directing and evaluating all human resource functions of the Company, and directing and managing all administrative functions of the Company; and (e) Mr. Logan Shumway, former Manager of the Company's\nWhite Mesa Mill, became the Director, Conventional Operations, responsible for overseeing the advancement of the Company's REE objectives, in addition to being responsible for overall White Mesa Mill management. In addition, and in support of the objective to reduce costs, effective as of August 31, 2020, former Chief Operating Officer, Mr. W. Paul Goranson left the Company to pursue other opportunities, and effective as of October 31, 2020, former Chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Matthew Tarnowski, left the Company to pursue other opportunities.\nContinued Efforts to Minimize Costs\nThe Company will continue to seek ways to minimize the costs of maintaining its critical properties in a state of readiness for potential improvements in market conditions, and is evaluating whether additional cost-cutting measures may be warranted at this time as a result of general market conditions, such as the possibility of monetizing non-core conventional assets of the Company. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: Potential Sale of Non-Core Assets,\u201d above.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31,

the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a net loss of $27.87 million or $0.23 per share compared with a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an operating loss of $24.63 million compared with an operating loss of $40.58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues\nPreviously, the Company's revenues from uranium were based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer had any uranium sales contacts. Any future\nsales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the Budget. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from Pond Return at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1.66 million, all of which were related to fees for ore received from a third-party uranium mine.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Return. The Company recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 from the pond solutions and alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nThere are no costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company did not make any concentrate sales of U3O8 or V2O5 and only collected a fee to receive ore from a third-party uranium mine for which the Company incurred de minimis costs, compared with $3.95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company spent $4.33 million for development of the Company's properties, which did not include costs associated with the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project, and significantly less costs associated with V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill, as were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $0.85 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $9.18 million primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2020. In the beginning of 2018 as well as the beginning of 2020, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, standby costs totaled $4.02 million compared with $2.58 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to a reduction in recovery activities at Nichols Ranch as it was placed on standby during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and prolonged periods of standby at the Mill. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $7.00 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.91 million compared with the prior year of $1.93 million, primarily due to changes in timing of estimated reclamation activities at some of the Company's projects.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate, general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.38 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred approximately $1.04 million in one-time management streamlining restructuring expenses.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $1.64 million and $14.35 million, respectively, in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium and vanadium prices versus our cost to produce. The decrease in impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to lower production levels as well as improved uranium prices.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.95 million compared with $1.49 million in the prior year due to early redemption of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other expenses net of other income totaled $2.29 million. These amounts primarily consist of a mark-to-market loss on the increase in fair value of warrant liabilities of $5.44 million, offset by a $1.84 million mark-to-market gain on investments accounted for at fair value, a gain on foreign exchange of $0.77 million, a mark-to-market gain on the change in the fair value of the Convertible Debentures of $0.16 million, interest income of $0.15 million, and other of $0.23 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income net of other expenses totaled $3.98 million. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share compared with a net loss of $25.36 million or $0.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an operating loss of $40.58 million compared with an operating loss of $21.31 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nThe Company's revenues from uranium were previously based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer has any uranium sales contacts. Any future sales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the proposed Uranium Reserve. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from its pond solution at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $31.72 million, of which $30.79 million was related to sales of 650,000 pounds of U3O8, which included the sale of 450,000 pounds of U3O8 pursuant to term contracts at an average price of\n$57.24 per pound and the sale of 200,000 pounds of U3O8 into contracts based on spot market prices at an average price of $25.16 per pound.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recovered 917,000 pounds of U3O8 of which 493,000 pounds were for the Company's own account and 424,000 pounds were for the account of a tolling customer. Of the 493,000 pounds recovered for its own account, 137,000 pounds were from alternate feed sources, 216,000 pounds were from uranium recovered from existing tailings pond solutions at the White Mesa Mill, and 140,000 pounds were from ISR recovery activities.\nCosts and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3.95 million, compared with $14.75 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in cost and expenses applicable to revenue is $2.08 million and nil related to toll processing and other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials. All costs and expenses applicable to revenue for 2018 were related to uranium concentrates.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company spent $9.18 million for development of the Company's properties. This is primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $9.91 million for development, permitting and land holding, comprised of the acquisition of royalties, the development of the Pinyon Plain Project and permitting and land holding costs related to the Pinyon Plain Project, development of the V2O5 test mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with preparing the White Mesa Mill for V2O5 production.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2019. In the beginning of 2018, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, standby costs totaled $2.58 million compared with $5.11 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to vanadium recovery activities at the White Mesa Mill.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.93 million compared with the prior year of $1.84 million, primarily due to normal accretion activity.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate and general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is a result of the Company not recognizing any intangible amortization cost from favorable contracts in the year ended December 31, 2019 as the Company does not have any additional contract sales, offset by an increase in spending on the Section 232 Petition and related Working Group activities of $0.77 million.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $14.35 million in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and included in impairment charges were depreciation expenses of $2.09 million. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project of $4.48 million, the decrease in the market price of vanadium recovered from Pond Return of $8.62 million and the decrease in the market price of vanadium in the La Sal stockpile of $1.25 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $4.58 million in inventory impairment due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project. Included in impairment were depreciation expenses of $2.05 million.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.49 million compared with $1.72 million in the prior year due to lower principal amounts from the repayment of Wyoming revenue bond loan and the put option conversion of the Convertible Debentures.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income and expense totaled $3.98 million income, net. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income and expense totaled $2.33 million expense, net. These amounts consist of a loss for the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $3.47 million and a loss in the mark-to-market values of the Company's Convertible Debentures of $0.61 million, partially offset by interest income of $0.34 million, sales of surplus assets of $0.29 million, gain of assets held for sale of $0.34 million and a $0.77 million increase in the value of investments accounted for at fair value.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFunding of major business and property acquisitions\nOver the past eight years the Company has funded major business and property acquisitions with capital provided by issuances of its Common Shares. In 2012, we acquired Titan Uranium Inc. and the U.S. Mining Division of Denison Mines Corp., in 2013 we acquired Strathmore Minerals Corp, in 2015 we acquired Uranerz and in 2016 we acquired Meste\u00f1a, each in exchange for newly issued shares.\nWe intend to continue to acquire assets utilizing Common Shares when we can do so under attractive terms.\nShares issued for cash\nOn December 23, 2016, the Company filed a prospectus supplement in both Canada and the United States to its Canadian base shelf prospectus and U.S. registration statement on Form S-3, which enabled the Company, at its discretion from time to time, to sell up to $20 million worth of Common Shares by way of an at-the-market\u201d offering (the ATM\u201d). On December 29, 2017, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On November 5, 2018, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. Then, on the same date, the Company filed a base shelf prospectus whereby the Company may sell any combination of the Securities\u201d as defined thereunder in one or more offerings up to an initial aggregate offering amount of $150.00 million. On May 5, 2019, the prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement expired, and was replaced on May 7, 2019 by a new prospectus supplement in the same amount, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2019, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2020, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $35.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of common shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the \"Offering\"). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 common\nshares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering (see Note 12 to the Financial Statements: Capital Stock\u201d).\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 18, 2021, the Company issued 5.50 million Common Shares at a weighted-average price of $5.53 for net proceeds of $29.70 million using the ATM.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2020 and future requirements for funds\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $40.16 million, including $20.17 million in cash, $2.25 million of marketable securities, approximately 690,700 pounds of uranium finished goods inventory and approximately 1,672,000 pounds of vanadium finished goods inventory. The Company believes it has sufficient cash and resources to carry out its business plan for at least the next twelve months.\nThe Company is actively focused on its forward-looking liquidity needs, especially in light of the current depressed uranium markets. The Company is evaluating its ongoing fixed cost structure as well as decisions related to project retention, advancement and development. If current uranium prices persist for any extended period of time, the Company will likely be required to raise capital or take other measures to fund its ongoing operations. Significant development activities, if warranted, will require that we arrange for financing in advance of planned expenditures. In addition, we expect to continue to augment our current financial resources with external financing as our long-term business needs require. We cannot provide any assurance that we will pursue any of these transactions or that we will be successful in completing them on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its working capital and its capital structure.\nCash and cash flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $40.99 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $32.89 million at December 31, 2019. The increase of $8.09 million was due primarily to cash provided by financing activities of $36.58 million, cash provided by investing activities of $3.58 million, offset by cash used in operating activities of $32.18 million and loss on foreign exchange on cash held in foreign currencies of $0.11 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $32.18 million is comprised of the net loss of $27.87 million for the period adjusted for non-cash items and for changes in working capital items. Significant items not involving cash were $2.70 million of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, $1.64 million impairment on inventory, share-based compensation expense of $2.60 million, a $5.44 million change in warrant liabilities, accretion of asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) of $1.91 million, offset by a revision of ARO of $7.85 million, unrealized foreign exchange gain of $1.05 million, other non-cash expenses of $0.71 million and a $0.16 million change in value of the Convertible Debentures. Other items include an increase in inventories of $6.10 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.08 million, partially offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables of $0.19 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.15 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.58 million comprised of $4.21 million cash received from maturities of marketable securities partially offset by $0.63 million cash used for the purchase of mineral properties and property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $36.58 million consisting of $52.39 million net proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares from a public offering and the issuance of shares under the Company's ATM facility, $0.49 million cash received from exercise of stock options, and $0.13 million cash received from non-controlling interest, partially offset by $16.02 million to repay loans and borrowings and $0.42 million cash paid to fund employee income tax withholding due upon vesting of restricted stock units.\nYear ended December 31, 2019\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $32.89 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $34.29 million at December 31, 2018.

These leases are renewable annually and are expected to total $1.51 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies. These judgments and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances taking into account previous experience. Although the Company regularly reviews the estimates and judgments made that affect these financial statements, actual results may be materially different.\nSignificant estimates made by management include:\na. Exploration Stage\nSEC Industry Guide 7 defines a reserve as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.\u201d The classification of a reserve must be evidenced by a bankable feasibility study using the latest three-year price average. While the Company has established the existence of mineral resources and has successfully extracted and recovered saleable uranium from certain of these resources, the Company has not established proven or probable reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, for these operations or any of its uranium projects. As a result, the Company is in the Exploration Stage as defined under Industry Guide 7. Furthermore, the Company has no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of its uranium projects.\nWhile in the Exploration Stage, among other things, the Company must expense all amounts that would normally be capitalized and subsequently depreciated or depleted over the life of the mining operation on properties that have proven or probable reserves. Items such as the construction of wellfields and related header houses, additions to our recovery facilities and advancement of properties will all be expensed in the period incurred. As a result, the Company's consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to the financial statements of mining companies in the development or production stages.\nb. Resource estimates utilized\nThe Company utilizes estimates of its mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons. The information relating to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the deposits requires complex geological judgments to interpret the data. The estimation of future cash flows related to resources is based upon factors such as estimates of future uranium prices, future construction and operating costs along with geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the resource. Changes in the mineral resource estimates may impact the carrying value of mining and recovery assets, goodwill, reclamation and remediation obligations and depreciation and impairment.\nc. Depreciation of mining and recovery assets acquired\nFor mining and recovery assets actively extracting and recovering uranium we depreciate the acquisition costs of the mining and recovery assets on a straight-line basis over our estimated lives of the mining and recovery assets. The process of estimating the useful life of the mining and recovery assets requires significant judgment in evaluating and assessing available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data, projected rates of extraction and recovery, estimated commodity price forecasts and the timing of future expenditures, all of which are, by their very nature, subject to interpretation and uncertainty.\nChanges in these estimates may materially impact the carrying value of the Company's mining and recovery assets and the recorded amount of depreciation.\nd. Impairment testing of mining and recovery assets\nThe Company undertakes a review of the carrying values of its mining and recovery assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may exceed their estimated net recoverable amounts determined by reference to estimated future operating results and net cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of a mining or recovery asset is not recoverable based on this analysis. In undertaking this review, the management of the Company is required to make significant estimates of, among other things, future production and sale volumes, forecast commodity prices, future operating and capital costs and reclamation costs to the end of the mining asset's life. These estimates are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may ultimately have an impact on the expected recoverability of the carrying values of mining and recovery assets.\ne. Asset retirement obligations\nAsset retirement obligations are recorded as a liability when an asset that will require reclamation and remediation is initially acquired. For disturbances created on a property owned that will require future reclamation and remediation the Company records asset retirement obligations for such disturbance when occurred. The Company has accrued its best estimate of its share of the cost to decommission its mining and milling properties in accordance with existing laws, contracts and other policies. The estimate of future costs involves a number of estimates relating to timing, type of costs, mine closure plans, and review of potential methods and technical advancements. Furthermore, due to uncertainties concerning environmental remediation, the ultimate cost of the Company's decommissioning liability could differ from amounts provided. The estimate of the Company's obligation is subject to change due to amendments to applicable laws and regulations and as new information concerning the Company's operations becomes available. The Company is not able to determine the impact on its financial position, if any, of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future. Additionally, the expected cash flows in the future are discounted at the Company's estimated cost of capital based on the periods the Company expects to complete the reclamation and remediation activities. Differences in the expected periods of reclamation or in the discount rates used could have a material difference in the actual settlement of the obligations compared with the amounts provided.", "summary": "- Energy Fuels Inc.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes thereto. This Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See section heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOutlook\nOverview\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a strategic national U.S. Uranium Reserve program, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of our production facilities, including the currently operating White Mesa Mill, as well as the Alta Mesa ISR Facility, the Nichols Ranch ISR Facility, the La Sal Complex and Pinyon Plain Mine, which are currently on standby. The Company may commence such activities, prior to the implementation of all program details, recognizing that there can be no guarantee that the program details will be satisfactory and that the timing and outcome of this process is therefore uncertain, or as market conditions may warrant. Alternatively, the Company may defer commencing any such activities until further clarification is obtained, or as market conditions otherwise warrant. No decisions on any project-specific actions have been made at this time.\nDuring 2021 the Company expects to recover uranium at the White Mesa Mill from pond-returns and from alternate feed materials. The vanadium pond-return campaign that was conducted in 2019 was brought to a close in early 2020. The Company also expects to produce mixed REE carbonate from natural monazite ore during 2021, subject to successful ramp-up. The Company does not plan to extract and/or recover any amounts of uranium of any significance from its Nichols Ranch Project in 2021, which was placed on standby in the second quarter of 2020 due to the depletion of its existing wellfields. Uranium recovery is expected to be maintained at reduced levels, as a result of current uranium market conditions, until such time when market conditions improve sufficiently. Until such time that improvement in uranium market conditions is observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into, the Company expects to defer further wellfield development at its Nichols Ranch Project and maintain that project on standby. In addition, the Company expects to keep the Alta Mesa Project and its conventional mining properties on standby.\nThe Company is also seeking new sources of revenue, including its emerging REE business, as well as new sources of alternate feed materials and new fee processing opportunities at the White Mesa Mill that can be processed under existing market conditions (i.e., without reliance on current uranium sales prices). The Company will also continue its support of U.S. governmental activities to support the U.S. uranium mining industry, including the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve. In addition, the Company is in discussions to potentially sell certain of its non-core properties, although there are currently no binding offers, and there can be no assurance that a sale will be completed or that we will be successful in completing a sale on acceptable terms. The Company will evaluate additional acquisition and disposition opportunities that may arise.\nExtraction and Recovery Activities Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 196,500 pounds of U3O8, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company also recovered approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 for its own account. The Company expects to produce no vanadium. In 2021, the Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons of total rare earth oxides ( TREO\u201d).\nThe Company has strategically opted not to enter into any uranium sales commitments for 2021. Therefore, subject to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, all 2021 uranium production is expected to be added to existing inventories, which inventories are expected to total approximately 720,000 to 750,000 pounds of U3O8 at year-end. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or improvements in general market conditions, both ISR and conventional uranium extraction and/or recovery is expected to continue to be maintained at reduced levels until such time that improvements in uranium market conditions are observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into. All V2O5 inventory is expected to be sold on the spot market if prices rise significantly above current levels, but otherwise maintained in inventory. The Company expects to sell all or a portion of its mixed REE carbonate to global separation facilities and/or to stockpile it for future separation at the Mill or elsewhere.\nISR Activities\nWe extracted and recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Nichols Ranch Project for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company expects to produce insignificant quantities of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 from Nichols Ranch.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Nichols Ranch wellfields had nine header houses that previously extracted uranium, and which are now depleted. Until such time as improvement in uranium market conditions is observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured, the Company expects to defer development of further header houses at its Nichols Ranch Project. The Company currently holds 34 fully-permitted, undeveloped wellfields at Nichols Ranch, including four additional wellfields at the Nichols Ranch wellfields, 22 wellfields at the adjacent Jane Dough wellfields, and eight wellfields at the Hank Project, which is fully permitted to be constructed as a satellite facility to the Nichols Ranch Plant.\nThe Company expects to continue to keep the Alta Mesa Project on standby until such time as improvements in uranium market conditions are observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured.\nConventional Activities\nConventional Extraction and Recovery Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the White Mesa Mill recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5. The Mill also focused on developing its REE recovery business. During 2021, the Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 at the White Mesa Mill, including uranium recovered through the processing of REE- and uranium-bearing natural monazite ore. The Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the Mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons TREO. The Company currently has approximately 127,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in stockpiled alternate feed material and ore inventory that can be recovered in the future for the U.S. uranium reserve or as general market conditions warrant. In addition, there remains an estimated 1.5-3 million pounds of solubilized recoverable V2O5 inventory remaining in the tailings facility awaiting future recovery, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis whereby uranium and/or vanadium recovery is scheduled as mill feed, cash needs, contract requirements, and/or market conditions may warrant. The Company currently expects that planned uranium production from alternate feed materials, processing natural monazite ore for the recovery of uranium and REEs, and receipt of uranium-bearing materials from mine cleanup activities will keep the Mill in operation through 2021 and beyond. The Company is also actively pursuing opportunities to process additional sources of natural monazite ore, new and additional alternate feed material sources, and new and additional low-grade ore from third parties in connection with various uranium clean-up requirements. Successful results from these activities would allow the Mill to extend operations well into 2022 and beyond.\nHowever, if at any time the Company is unable to justify full operation of the Mill, the Company would place uranium, REE and/or vanadium recovery activities at the Mill on standby at that time. While on standby, the Mill would continue to dry and package material from the Nichols Ranch Plant, if operating, and continue to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future milling campaigns. Each future milling campaign would be subject to receipt of sufficient mill feed and resulting cash flow that would allow the Company to operate the Mill on a profitable basis or to recover all or a portion of the Mill's standby costs.\nConventional Standby, Permitting and Evaluation Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, standby and environmental compliance activities occurred at the Pinyon Plain Project. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, during 2021, the Company plans to continue carrying out engineering, metallurgical testing, procurement and construction management activities at its Pinyon Plain Project. The timing of the Company's plans to extract and process mineralized materials from this project will be based on the results of this additional evaluation work, along with market conditions, available financing, sales requirements, and/or permits required for copper recovery at the Mill.\nThe Company is selectively advancing certain permits at its other major conventional uranium projects, such as the Roca Honda Project, a large, high-grade conventional project in New Mexico. The Company will also maintain required permits at the Company's conventional projects, including the Sheep Mountain Project, La Sal Complex, and the Whirlwind mines. In\naddition, the Company will continue to evaluate the Bullfrog Property at its Henry Mountains Project. Expenditures for certain of these projects have been adjusted to coincide with expected dates of price recoveries based on the Company's forecasts. All of these projects serve as important pipeline assets for the Company's future conventional production capabilities, as market conditions warrant. The Company is also in discussions to potentially sell the Tony M, Daneros, Rim and other non-core conventional assets.\nUranium Sales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed no sales of uranium. The Company currently has no remaining contracts, and therefore all existing uranium inventory and future production is fully unhedged to future uranium price changes.\nVanadium Sales\nDuring 2020, the Company completed no sales of vanadium. The Company expects to sell finished vanadium product when justified into the metallurgical industry, as well as other markets that demand a higher purity product, including the aerospace, chemical, and potentially the vanadium battery industries. The Company expects to sell to a diverse group of customers in order to maximize revenues and profits. The vanadium produced in the recent pond return campaign was a high-purity vanadium product of 99.6%-99.7% V2O5. The Company believes there may be opportunities to sell certain quantities of this high-purity material at a premium to reported spot prices. The Company may also retain vanadium product in inventory for future sale, depending on vanadium spot prices and general market conditions.\nRare Earth Sales\nThe Company expects to commence commercial production of a mixed REE carbonate in 2021. Subject to successfully ramping-up production of a salable product during 2021, the Company expects to sell some or all of this intermediate REE product to Neo's Silmet separation facility in Europe and potentially to other REE separation facilities outside the U.S. To the extent not sold, the Company expects to stockpile mixed REE carbonate at the Mill for future separation and other downstream REE processing at the Mill or elsewhere. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above and Update on Rare Earth Element Initiative,\u201d below.\nThe Company also continues to pursue new sources of revenue, including additional alternate feed materials and other sources of feed for the White Mesa Mill.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company continues to evaluate the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business objectives, projections and workforce. Due to the current uncertainty, the Company is continuing its cost-cutting measures, while retaining the operational readiness of the Company's core production assets. The Company is also continuing to work to secure U.S. government support for U.S. uranium miners. To date, although the Company has made operational adjustments since the onset of the pandemic to ensure its workforce remains protected, the Company has not been required to shut down any operations as a result of COVID-19. None of these operational adjustments have been material to the Company. The Company has evaluated any potential shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of COVID-19, and has determined that any such shutdown could be accommodated by the Company in a manner consistent with a typical shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of depressed commodity prices. Management believes the Company is well-capitalized and will be able to withstand facility shutdowns or depressed share prices as a result of COVID-19 for at least the next twelve months.\nBought Deal Financing\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of Common Shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 Common Shares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering.\nFull Redemption of Convertible Debentures\nOn July 14, 2020, the Company redeemed Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Cdn$20.86 million Convertible Debentures then outstanding for approximately $7.78 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding July 14, 2020. On October 6, 2020, the Company redeemed the remaining Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Convertible Debentures then outstanding for\napproximately $7.82 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding October 6, 2020. As a result of the final redemption, no Convertible Debentures are outstanding or subject to the terms of the Indenture, and the Convertible Debentures have ceased to be listed on the TSX. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements: Loans and Borrowings.\u201d The Company decided to redeem all of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity because the U.S.-Canada currency exchange rate was favorable, the Company had sufficient cash available, and the Company avoided approximately US$0.46 million in interest payments in 2020 by doing so. By proactively managing its outstanding indebtedness in this way, the Company was able to redeem the Convertible Debentures on the Company's own timing and terms and with minimal market disruption. The Company currently has no other remaining short- or long-term debt.\nAgreement to Acquire Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) Borehole Logging Technology and Equipment\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire from GeoInstruments Logging LLC ( GIL\u201d) all of its Prompt Fission Neutron ( PFN\u201d) technology and equipment, including all of its related intellectual property, giving Energy Fuels the exclusive right to use, license, and service this particular PFN technology globally. PFN is critical to successful uranium production particularly from many in situ recovery ( ISR\u201d) deposits, as it more accurately measures downhole in-situ U3O8 ore grade versus traditional Total Gamma and Spectral Gamma methods. On July 31, 2020, the parties closed the transaction and all such equipment and technology was transferred to the Company.\nThe PFN equipment and technology acquired by Energy Fuels includes: four (4) PFN tools; nine (9) gamma tools; two (2) low-mileage, heavy-duty logging trucks with logging and associated equipment; power supplies, computers, communication, and other technology; and all associated intellectual property, and the sole right to utilize and license the acquired PFN technology globally. The total consideration paid by Energy Fuels to GIL was $0.5 million cash.\nEnergy Fuels currently has some PFN equipment in various states of repair, which it has used for its mining operations in the past, as do other companies in the U.S. and around the world. With the acquisition of this additional PFN equipment and technology from GIL, Energy Fuels is not only able to utilize the additional equipment to ramp-up production from its ISR properties more quickly and efficiently in the event of improved market conditions, but has also secured the ability to service, repair and maintain PFN equipment currently held by the Company and others, as well as license this technology to others in the future.\nUpdate on Rare Earth Element Initiative\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company announced its intent to enter the REE market following several months of review and testing, including discussions with various technical experts and the U.S. government. The U.S. government is actively seeking a domestic source of REE minerals, which are needed for national defense among other applications.\nREEs are a group of 17 chemical elements (the 15 elements in the lanthanum series, plus yttrium and scandium) that have a variety of industrial, energy, military and defense uses, including automotive components, communications technology, clean energy production, consumer electronics, defense systems, advanced magnets, lasers and numerous other applications. According to a 2017 report by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS\u201d), China has controlled more than 90% of the global supply of REEs since the late-1990s and has placed restrictions on REE exports since 2010.\nEnergy Fuels believes the White Mesa Mill is uniquely suited to potentially receive and process a number of different types of ores for the recovery of REEs (along with uranium), which, if achievable on a commercial basis and subject to the receipt of any required license or permit amendments, would eliminate the current need to ship those ores to China for processing. If successful, the Company expects to offer customers tolling or processing arrangements at the White Mesa Mill.\nOn May 21, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into consulting agreements with Constantine Karayannopoulos and Brock O'Kelley, two REE industry experts who each have decades of experience producing commercially viable rare earth products, to aid in the development and implementation of commercial and technical REE strategies for the Company's REE program. A chemical engineer by training with more than 25 years of experience in the rare earth industry, Mr. Karayannopoulos, was at the time of the announcement Chair of Neo Performance Materials (TSX:NEO) ( Neo\u201d), one of the world's leading producers of advanced industrial materials, including rare earth-based engineered products, for multiple global markets. Mr. O'Kelley played a key role in the operation of the Mountain Pass, California rare earth processing facility during the 1990s and 2000s. Both are industry veterans with extensive knowledge of REE processing facility design, start-up, operations, and downstream value-added manufacturing of advanced REE products. On July 7, 2020, Mr. Karayannopoulos was reappointed as President and CEO of Neo. As a result of his new executive roles with Neo, his consulting agreement with the Company ended on August 6, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the Company entered into a non-exclusive Letter of Intent with Neo, under which: (i) Mr. Karayannopoulos and other Neo personnel will continue to assist Energy Fuels in developing commercial and technical aspects of the Company's REE strategy, including the potential production of a rare earth oxide concentrate at the Mill that can be sold to REE separation facilities; and (ii) the Company and Neo will work together toward potentially creating\na longer term mutually beneficial relationship, which may involve commitments to buy and sell all or a portion of the REE concentrate produced at the Mill or other commercial arrangements.\nOn December 14, 2020, the Company announced it entered into a three-year supply agreement with The Chemours Company (NYSE: CC) ( Chemours\u201d) to acquire a minimum of 2,500 tons per year of natural monazite sands, one of the highest-grade REE ores in the world, from Chemours' Offerman Mineral Sand Plant located in Georgia. The Company expects to process this monazite at the Mill, starting in 2021, to recover the contained uranium and to produce a marketable mixed REE carbonate as a step toward re-establishing a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company and Neo jointly announced that they had entered into an agreement in principle, subject to completion of definitive agreements, under which Energy Fuels will process natural monazite sands into an REE Carbonate beginning in March or April 2021 and ship a portion of that production to Neo's rare earth separations facility in Sillam\u00e4e, Estonia (\"Silmet\"). Neo will then process the REE Carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth-based advanced materials. Silmet is the only operational rare earth separations facility in Europe and has been separating rare earths into commercial value-added products for more than 50 years. Implementation of this initiative is subject to successful ramp-up to commercial-scale operations, execution of definitive agreements, and optimization of the companies' production processes.\nUpon a successful ramp-up of this program, the Company will be the first U.S. company in several years to produce a marketable mixed REE concentrate ready for separation on a commercial scale. The Company estimates that the amount of REEs contained in the monazite sands to be supplied by Chemours will equal close to 10% of total current U.S. REE demand, as contained in end-use products.\nRemoval and recovery of the uranium and other radionuclides from rare earth ores is a key aspect of Energy Fuels' value proposition, as many REE separation and recovery facilities are not able to handle those radionuclides from a technical or regulatory standpoint. The White Mesa Mill has a 40-year history of responsibly handling, processing and recycling uranium bearing materials. Therefore, it has the potential to provide a crucial link in a commercially viable U.S. REE supply chain. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above.\nProposed Establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group Update\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company participated in the joint filing of a Petition for Relief under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten National Security (the Petition\u201d). The Petition describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China are believed to represent a threat to U.S. national security.\nOn July 18, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce ( DOC\u201d) initiated an investigation in response to the Petition (the Section 232 Investigation\u201d).\nOn April 14, 2019, the DOC completed the Section 232 Investigation, and the Secretary of Commerce submitted a report to the former President of the United States containing his findings (the Section 232 Report\u201d).\nOn July 12, 2019, in response to the Section 232 Report, former President Trump issued a memorandum, where he stated that I agree with the Secretary that the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.\u201d In order to address the concerns identified by the Secretary regarding domestic uranium production and to ensure a comprehensive review of the entire domestic nuclear supply chain,\u201d former President Trump formed the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group (the Working Group\u201d) to examine the current state of domestic nuclear fuel production to reinvigorate the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, consistent with United States national security and nonproliferation goals.\u201d Former President Trump instructed the Working Group to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production,\u201d and to submit a report to him within 90 days setting forth the Working Group's findings and making recommendations to further enable domestic nuclear fuel production if needed.\u201d\nOn February 10, 2020, the federal executive Budget for fiscal year 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021) (the Budget\u201d) was published. The Budget Supports Nuclear Fuel Cycle Capabilities,\u201d and states that [o]n July 12, 2019, the [former] President determined that \u2018...the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.' The Budget establishes a U.S. Uranium Reserve to provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.\u201d Table 25-1 of the Budget sought congressional appropriations of $150 million per year over the next 10 years (totaling $1.5 billion over that time frame) for domestic uranium purchases. For fiscal 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021), the Budget sought an appropriation of $150 million, to remain available until expended,\u201d as the appropriation for the first year of the 10-year program. The Budget further stated that Establishing a Uranium Reserve provides assurance of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption and\nsupports strategic U.S. fuel cycle capabilities. This action addresses immediate challenges to the production of domestic uranium and reflects the Administration's Nuclear Fuel Working Group (NFWG) priorities. The NFWG will continue to evaluate issues related to uranium supply chain and fuel supply.\u201d\nOn April 23, 2020, the Working Group published its report: Restoring America's Competitive Nuclear Energy Advantage: A strategy to assure U.S. national security. This comprehensive strategy sought to revive and strengthen U.S. nuclear fuel capabilities, starting with uranium mining, with the goals of supporting U.S. energy and national security, preventing geopolitical adversaries (particularly those in Russia) from using their nuclear capabilities to influence the U.S. and the world, and promoting global non-proliferation objectives and nuclear safety. The report stated that the clear outcome of the Working Group's efforts is confirmation that it is in the nation's national security interests to preserve the assets and investments of the entire U.S. nuclear enterprise and to revitalize the sector to regain U.S. global nuclear leadership.\u201d The report recommended government purchases to establish a Uranium Reserve, as contemplated by the Budget, and other actions aimed to strengthen the entire nuclear fuel cycle.\nOn December 27, 2020, the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill, which includes $75 million for the proposed establishment of a strategic U.S. Uranium Reserve, was signed into law by the United States Congress. This key funding opens the door for the U.S. government to purchase domestically-produced uranium to guard against potential commercial and national security risks presented by the country's near-total reliance on foreign imports of uranium. The Company stands ready to benefit from this program through sales out of its existing uranium inventories and future production from its mines and facilities. However, because the U.S. Uranium Reserve has yet to be established at this time, the details of implementation of activities pursuant to the new law have not yet been defined. As a result, there can be no certainty as to the outcome of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, if any, including the process for and details of its development, and any resulting support for the Company's ongoing and planned activities, or for any further evaluations of the Working Group.\nIf the uranium and vanadium markets or general market conditions do not improve, whether as a result of the establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or otherwise, the Company may further reduce its operational activities as required in order to minimize its cash expenditures while preserving its core asset base for increased production in the future, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe Company's Plans in Response to the Proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of its production facilities, subject to general market conditions. No decisions on any project-specific actions to be taken in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve have been made at this time.\nRenewal of the Russian Suspension Agreement\nOn September 14, 2020, the DOC announced that it had obtained Russia's agreement to extend limits on uranium imports into the U.S. from Russia through 2040 under an extended Russian Suspension Agreement. This is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry. The DOC won important concessions from Russia, including lower quotas starting in the mid-2020s, allowing only a portion of the quotas to be used for the sale of U3O8 and conversion into the U.S., and strict controls on Russian enrichment service contracts, reducing U.S. dependence on Russian uranium in the long term. While the extended Russian Suspension Agreement is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry, it does not supplant the need for the establishment of a Uranium Reserve as proposed in the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill and as recommended by the Working Group.\nManagement Streamlining\nOn August 20, 2020, the Company announced that it was making a number of changes to its management team in order to reduce costs, flatten the organizational structure, and focus on the ongoing growth of a new generation of U.S. uranium and REE professionals, including the following, effective September 1, 2020: (a) Mr. Scott Bakken, former Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs, became the Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, responsible for permitting and regulatory matters relating to all of the Company's operations, both conventional and ISR, and also for overall worker health and safety matters at the Company; (b) Mr. Bernard Bonifas, former Director, Wyoming Operations, became the Director, ISR Operations, responsible for all of the Company's ISR operations, including its Nichols Ranch ISR project in Wyoming and its Alta Mesa ISR project in Texas; (c) Ms. Sarai Luksch, CPA, joined the Company as Controller; (d) Ms. Dee Ann Nazarenus, former Director, Human Resources & Administration, became the Vice President, Human Resources & Administration, responsible for planning, developing, organizing, implementing, directing and evaluating all human resource functions of the Company, and directing and managing all administrative functions of the Company; and (e) Mr. Logan Shumway, former Manager of the Company's\nWhite Mesa Mill, became the Director, Conventional Operations, responsible for overseeing the advancement of the Company's REE objectives, in addition to being responsible for overall White Mesa Mill management. In addition, and in support of the objective to reduce costs, effective as of August 31, 2020, former Chief Operating Officer, Mr. W. Paul Goranson left the Company to pursue other opportunities, and effective as of October 31, 2020, former Chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Matthew Tarnowski, left the Company to pursue other opportunities.\nContinued Efforts to Minimize Costs\nThe Company will continue to seek ways to minimize the costs of maintaining its critical properties in a state of readiness for potential improvements in market conditions, and is evaluating whether additional cost-cutting measures may be warranted at this time as a result of general market conditions, such as the possibility of monetizing non-core conventional assets of the Company. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: Potential Sale of Non-Core Assets,\u201d above.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands of dollars):\n\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a net loss of $27.87 million or $0.23 per share compared with a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an operating loss of $24.63 million compared with an operating loss of $40.58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues\nPreviously, the Company's revenues from uranium were based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer had any uranium sales contacts. Any future\nsales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the Budget. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from Pond Return at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1.66 million, all of which were related to fees for ore received from a third-party uranium mine.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Return. The Company recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 from the pond solutions and alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nThere are no costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company did not make any concentrate sales of U3O8 or V2O5 and only collected a fee to receive ore from a third-party uranium mine for which the Company incurred de minimis costs, compared with $3.95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company spent $4.33 million for development of the Company's properties, which did not include costs associated with the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project, and significantly less costs associated with V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill, as were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $0.85 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $9.18 million primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2020. In the beginning of 2018 as well as the beginning of 2020, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, standby costs totaled $4.02 million compared with $2.58 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to a reduction in recovery activities at Nichols Ranch as it was placed on standby during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and prolonged periods of standby at the Mill. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $7.00 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.91 million compared with the prior year of $1.93 million, primarily due to changes in timing of estimated reclamation activities at some of the Company's projects.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate, general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.38 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred approximately $1.04 million in one-time management streamlining restructuring expenses.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $1.64 million and $14.35 million, respectively, in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium and vanadium prices versus our cost to produce. The decrease in impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to lower production levels as well as improved uranium prices.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.95 million compared with $1.49 million in the prior year due to early redemption of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other expenses net of other income totaled $2.29 million. These amounts primarily consist of a mark-to-market loss on the increase in fair value of warrant liabilities of $5.44 million, offset by a $1.84 million mark-to-market gain on investments accounted for at fair value, a gain on foreign exchange of $0.77 million, a mark-to-market gain on the change in the fair value of the Convertible Debentures of $0.16 million, interest income of $0.15 million, and other of $0.23 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income net of other expenses totaled $3.98 million. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share compared with a net loss of $25.36 million or $0.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an operating loss of $40.58 million compared with an operating loss of $21.31 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nThe Company's revenues from uranium were previously based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer has any uranium sales contacts. Any future sales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the proposed Uranium Reserve. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from its pond solution at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $31.72 million, of which $30.79 million was related to sales of 650,000 pounds of U3O8, which included the sale of 450,000 pounds of U3O8 pursuant to term contracts at an average price of\n$57.24 per pound and the sale of 200,000 pounds of U3O8 into contracts based on spot market prices at an average price of $25.16 per pound.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recovered 917,000 pounds of U3O8 of which 493,000 pounds were for the Company's own account and 424,000 pounds were for the account of a tolling customer. Of the 493,000 pounds recovered for its own account, 137,000 pounds were from alternate feed sources, 216,000 pounds were from uranium recovered from existing tailings pond solutions at the White Mesa Mill, and 140,000 pounds were from ISR recovery activities.\nCosts and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3.95 million, compared with $14.75 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in cost and expenses applicable to revenue is $2.08 million and nil related to toll processing and other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials. All costs and expenses applicable to revenue for 2018 were related to uranium concentrates.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company spent $9.18 million for development of the Company's properties. This is primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $9.91 million for development, permitting and land holding, comprised of the acquisition of royalties, the development of the Pinyon Plain Project and permitting and land holding costs related to the Pinyon Plain Project, development of the V2O5 test mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with preparing the White Mesa Mill for V2O5 production.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2019. In the beginning of 2018, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, standby costs totaled $2.58 million compared with $5.11 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to vanadium recovery activities at the White Mesa Mill.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.93 million compared with the prior year of $1.84 million, primarily due to normal accretion activity.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate and general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is a result of the Company not recognizing any intangible amortization cost from favorable contracts in the year ended December 31, 2019 as the Company does not have any additional contract sales, offset by an increase in spending on the Section 232 Petition and related Working Group activities of $0.77 million.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $14.35 million in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and included in impairment charges were depreciation expenses of $2.09 million. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project of $4.48 million, the decrease in the market price of vanadium recovered from Pond Return of $8.62 million and the decrease in the market price of vanadium in the La Sal stockpile of $1.25 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $4.58 million in inventory impairment due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project. Included in impairment were depreciation expenses of $2.05 million.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.49 million compared with $1.72 million in the prior year due to lower principal amounts from the repayment of Wyoming revenue bond loan and the put option conversion of the Convertible Debentures.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income and expense totaled $3.98 million income, net. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income and expense totaled $2.33 million expense, net. These amounts consist of a loss for the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $3.47 million and a loss in the mark-to-market values of the Company's Convertible Debentures of $0.61 million, partially offset by interest income of $0.34 million, sales of surplus assets of $0.29 million, gain of assets held for sale of $0.34 million and a $0.77 million increase in the value of investments accounted for at fair value.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFunding of major business and property acquisitions\nOver the past eight years the Company has funded major business and property acquisitions with capital provided by issuances of its Common Shares. In 2012, we acquired Titan Uranium Inc. and the U.S. Mining Division of Denison Mines Corp., in 2013 we acquired Strathmore Minerals Corp, in 2015 we acquired Uranerz and in 2016 we acquired Meste\u00f1a, each in exchange for newly issued shares.\nWe intend to continue to acquire assets utilizing Common Shares when we can do so under attractive terms.\nShares issued for cash\nOn December 23, 2016, the Company filed a prospectus supplement in both Canada and the United States to its Canadian base shelf prospectus and U.S. registration statement on Form S-3, which enabled the Company, at its discretion from time to time, to sell up to $20 million worth of Common Shares by way of an at-the-market\u201d offering (the ATM\u201d). On December 29, 2017, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On November 5, 2018, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. Then, on the same date, the Company filed a base shelf prospectus whereby the Company may sell any combination of the Securities\u201d as defined thereunder in one or more offerings up to an initial aggregate offering amount of $150.00 million. On May 5, 2019, the prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement expired, and was replaced on May 7, 2019 by a new prospectus supplement in the same amount, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2019, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2020, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $35.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of common shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the \"Offering\"). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 common\nshares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering (see Note 12 to the Financial Statements: Capital Stock\u201d).\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 18, 2021, the Company issued 5.50 million Common Shares at a weighted-average price of $5.53 for net proceeds of $29.70 million using the ATM.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2020 and future requirements for funds\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $40.16 million, including $20.17 million in cash, $2.25 million of marketable securities, approximately 690,700 pounds of uranium finished goods inventory and approximately 1,672,000 pounds of vanadium finished goods inventory. The Company believes it has sufficient cash and resources to carry out its business plan for at least the next twelve months.\nThe Company is actively focused on its forward-looking liquidity needs, especially in light of the current depressed uranium markets. The Company is evaluating its ongoing fixed cost structure as well as decisions related to project retention, advancement and development. If current uranium prices persist for any extended period of time, the Company will likely be required to raise capital or take other measures to fund its ongoing operations. Significant development activities, if warranted, will require that we arrange for financing in advance of planned expenditures. In addition, we expect to continue to augment our current financial resources with external financing as our long-term business needs require. We cannot provide any assurance that we will pursue any of these transactions or that we will be successful in completing them on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its working capital and its capital structure.\nCash and cash flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $40.99 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $32.89 million at December 31, 2019. The increase of $8.09 million was due primarily to cash provided by financing activities of $36.58 million, cash provided by investing activities of $3.58 million, offset by cash used in operating activities of $32.18 million and loss on foreign exchange on cash held in foreign currencies of $0.11 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $32.18 million is comprised of the net loss of $27.87 million for the period adjusted for non-cash items and for changes in working capital items. Significant items not involving cash were $2.70 million of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, $1.64 million impairment on inventory, share-based compensation expense of $2.60 million, a $5.44 million change in warrant liabilities, accretion of asset retirement obligation ( ARO\u201d) of $1.91 million, offset by a revision of ARO of $7.85 million, unrealized foreign exchange gain of $1.05 million, other non-cash expenses of $0.71 million and a $0.16 million change in value of the Convertible Debentures. Other items include an increase in inventories of $6.10 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.08 million, partially offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables of $0.19 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.15 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.58 million comprised of $4.21 million cash received from maturities of marketable securities partially offset by $0.63 million cash used for the purchase of mineral properties and property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $36.58 million consisting of $52.39 million net proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares from a public offering and the issuance of shares under the Company's ATM facility, $0.49 million cash received from exercise of stock options, and $0.13 million cash received from non-controlling interest, partially offset by $16.02 million to repay loans and borrowings and $0.42 million cash paid to fund employee income tax withholding due upon vesting of restricted stock units.\nYear ended December 31, 2019\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $32.89 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $34.29 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease of $1.40 million was due primarily to cash provided by financing activities of $20.36 million, cash provided by investing activities of $22.58 million, offset by cash used in operating activities of $44.38 million and loss on foreign exchange on cash held in foreign currencies of $0.04 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $44.38 million is comprised of the net loss of $38.09 million for the period adjusted for non-cash items and for changes in working capital items. Significant items not involving cash were $1.21 million of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, $14.35 million impairment on inventory, share-based compensation expense of $3.77 million, accretion of asset retirement obligation of $1.93 million, other non-cash expenses of\n$2.31 million, unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.08 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.01 million, offset by an increase in inventories of $18.53 million, a decrease in trade and other receivables of $0.06 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.20 million, $3.73 million change in warrant liabilities, $0.29 million change in value of the Convertible Debentures, non-cash standby costs of $1.42 million and changes in deferred revenue of $2.72 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $22.58 million related to cash received from the sale and maturities of marketable securities.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $20.36 million consisting of $19.68 million proceeds from the issuance of stock using the Company's ATM offering, $0.80 million in proceeds from notes payable and $0.15 million cash received from exercise of stock options, partially offset by $0.32 million to repay loans and borrowings.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the Company entered into commitments with federal and state agencies and private individuals to lease surface and mineral rights.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes thereto. This Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section heading Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See section heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOutlook\nOverview\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a strategic national U.S. Uranium Reserve program, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of our production facilities, including the currently operating White Mesa Mill, as well as the Alta Mesa ISR Facility, the Nichols Ranch ISR Facility, the La Sal Complex and Pinyon Plain Mine, which are currently on standby. The Company may commence such activities, prior to the implementation of all program details, recognizing that there can be no guarantee that the program details will be satisfactory and that the timing and outcome of this process is therefore uncertain, or as market conditions may warrant. Alternatively, the Company may defer commencing any such activities until further clarification is obtained, or as market conditions otherwise warrant. No decisions on any project-specific actions have been made at this time.\nDuring 2021 the Company expects to recover uranium at the White Mesa Mill from pond-returns and from alternate feed materials. The vanadium pond-return campaign that was conducted in 2019 was brought to a close in early 2020. The Company also expects to produce mixed REE carbonate from natural monazite ore during 2021, subject to successful ramp-up. The Company does not plan to extract and/or recover any amounts of uranium of any significance from its Nichols Ranch Project in 2021, which was placed on standby in the second quarter of 2020 due to the depletion of its existing wellfields. Uranium recovery is expected to be maintained at reduced levels, as a result of current uranium market conditions, until such time when market conditions improve sufficiently. Until such time that improvement in uranium market conditions is observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into, the Company expects to defer further wellfield development at its Nichols Ranch Project and maintain that project on standby. In addition, the Company expects to keep the Alta Mesa Project and its conventional mining properties on standby.\nThe Company is also seeking new sources of revenue, including its emerging REE business, as well as new sources of alternate feed materials and new fee processing opportunities at the White Mesa Mill that can be processed under existing market conditions (i.e., without reliance on current uranium sales prices). The Company will also continue its support of U.S. governmental activities to support the U.S. uranium mining industry, including the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve. In addition, the Company is in discussions to potentially sell certain of its non-core properties, although there are currently no binding offers, and there can be no assurance that a sale will be completed or that we will be successful in completing a sale on acceptable terms. The Company will evaluate additional acquisition and disposition opportunities that may arise.\nExtraction and Recovery Activities Overview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 196,500 pounds of U3O8, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company also recovered approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5, all of which were for the account of the Company. The Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 for its own account. The Company expects to produce no vanadium. In 2021, the Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons of total rare earth oxides ( TREO\u201d).\nThe Company has strategically opted not to enter into any uranium sales commitments for 2021. Therefore, subject to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, all 2021 uranium production is expected to be added to existing inventories, which inventories are expected to total approximately 720,000 to 750,000 pounds of U3O8 at year-end. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or improvements in general market conditions, both ISR and conventional uranium extraction and/or recovery is expected to continue to be maintained at reduced levels until such time that improvements in uranium market conditions are observed or suitable sales contracts can be entered into. All V2O5 inventory is expected to be sold on the spot market if prices rise significantly above current levels, but otherwise maintained in inventory. The Company expects to sell all or a portion of its mixed REE carbonate to global separation facilities and/or to stockpile it for future separation at the Mill or elsewhere.\nISR Activities\nWe extracted and recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Nichols Ranch Project for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company expects to produce insignificant quantities of U3O8 in the year ending December 31, 2021 from Nichols Ranch.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Nichols Ranch wellfields had nine header houses that previously extracted uranium, and which are now depleted. Until such time as improvement in uranium market conditions is observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured, the Company expects to defer development of further header houses at its Nichols Ranch Project. The Company currently holds 34 fully-permitted, undeveloped wellfields at Nichols Ranch, including four additional wellfields at the Nichols Ranch wellfields, 22 wellfields at the adjacent Jane Dough wellfields, and eight wellfields at the Hank Project, which is fully permitted to be constructed as a satellite facility to the Nichols Ranch Plant.\nThe Company expects to continue to keep the Alta Mesa Project on standby until such time as improvements in uranium market conditions are observed, the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve is established, and/or suitable sales contracts can be procured.\nConventional Activities\nConventional Extraction and Recovery Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the White Mesa Mill recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5. The Mill also focused on developing its REE recovery business. During 2021, the Company expects to recover approximately 30,000 to 60,000 pounds of U3O8 at the White Mesa Mill, including uranium recovered through the processing of REE- and uranium-bearing natural monazite ore. The Company also expects to produce approximately 2,000 to 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the Mill, containing approximately 1,000 to 1,600 tons TREO. The Company currently has approximately 127,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in stockpiled alternate feed material and ore inventory that can be recovered in the future for the U.S. uranium reserve or as general market conditions warrant. In addition, there remains an estimated 1.5-3 million pounds of solubilized recoverable V2O5 inventory remaining in the tailings facility awaiting future recovery, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis whereby uranium and/or vanadium recovery is scheduled as mill feed, cash needs, contract requirements, and/or market conditions may warrant. The Company currently expects that planned uranium production from alternate feed materials, processing natural monazite ore for the recovery of uranium and REEs, and receipt of uranium-bearing materials from mine cleanup activities will keep the Mill in operation through 2021 and beyond. The Company is also actively pursuing opportunities to process additional sources of natural monazite ore, new and additional alternate feed material sources, and new and additional low-grade ore from third parties in connection with various uranium clean-up requirements. Successful results from these activities would allow the Mill to extend operations well into 2022 and beyond.\nHowever, if at any time the Company is unable to justify full operation of the Mill, the Company would place uranium, REE and/or vanadium recovery activities at the Mill on standby at that time. While on standby, the Mill would continue to dry and package material from the Nichols Ranch Plant, if operating, and continue to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future milling campaigns. Each future milling campaign would be subject to receipt of sufficient mill feed and resulting cash flow that would allow the Company to operate the Mill on a profitable basis or to recover all or a portion of the Mill's standby costs.\nConventional Standby, Permitting and Evaluation Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, standby and environmental compliance activities occurred at the Pinyon Plain Project. Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and general market conditions, during 2021, the Company plans to continue carrying out engineering, metallurgical testing, procurement and construction management activities at its Pinyon Plain Project. The timing of the Company's plans to extract and process mineralized materials from this project will be based on the results of this additional evaluation work, along with market conditions, available financing, sales requirements, and/or permits required for copper recovery at the Mill.\nThe Company is selectively advancing certain permits at its other major conventional uranium projects, such as the Roca Honda Project, a large, high-grade conventional project in New Mexico. The Company will also maintain required permits at the Company's conventional projects, including the Sheep Mountain Project, La Sal Complex, and the Whirlwind mines. In\naddition, the Company will continue to evaluate the Bullfrog Property at its Henry Mountains Project. Expenditures for certain of these projects have been adjusted to coincide with expected dates of price recoveries based on the Company's forecasts. All of these projects serve as important pipeline assets for the Company's future conventional production capabilities, as market conditions warrant. The Company is also in discussions to potentially sell the Tony M, Daneros, Rim and other non-core conventional assets.\nUranium Sales\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed no sales of uranium. The Company currently has no remaining contracts, and therefore all existing uranium inventory and future production is fully unhedged to future uranium price changes.\nVanadium Sales\nDuring 2020, the Company completed no sales of vanadium. The Company expects to sell finished vanadium product when justified into the metallurgical industry, as well as other markets that demand a higher purity product, including the aerospace, chemical, and potentially the vanadium battery industries. The Company expects to sell to a diverse group of customers in order to maximize revenues and profits. The vanadium produced in the recent pond return campaign was a high-purity vanadium product of 99.6%-99.7% V2O5. The Company believes there may be opportunities to sell certain quantities of this high-purity material at a premium to reported spot prices. The Company may also retain vanadium product in inventory for future sale, depending on vanadium spot prices and general market conditions.\nRare Earth Sales\nThe Company expects to commence commercial production of a mixed REE carbonate in 2021. Subject to successfully ramping-up production of a salable product during 2021, the Company expects to sell some or all of this intermediate REE product to Neo's Silmet separation facility in Europe and potentially to other REE separation facilities outside the U.S. To the extent not sold, the Company expects to stockpile mixed REE carbonate at the Mill for future separation and other downstream REE processing at the Mill or elsewhere. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above and Update on Rare Earth Element Initiative,\u201d below.\nThe Company also continues to pursue new sources of revenue, including additional alternate feed materials and other sources of feed for the White Mesa Mill.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company continues to evaluate the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business objectives, projections and workforce. Due to the current uncertainty, the Company is continuing its cost-cutting measures, while retaining the operational readiness of the Company's core production assets. The Company is also continuing to work to secure U.S. government support for U.S. uranium miners. To date, although the Company has made operational adjustments since the onset of the pandemic to ensure its workforce remains protected, the Company has not been required to shut down any operations as a result of COVID-19. None of these operational adjustments have been material to the Company. The Company has evaluated any potential shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of COVID-19, and has determined that any such shutdown could be accommodated by the Company in a manner consistent with a typical shutdown of Company production facilities as a result of depressed commodity prices. Management believes the Company is well-capitalized and will be able to withstand facility shutdowns or depressed share prices as a result of COVID-19 for at least the next twelve months.\nBought Deal Financing\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of Common Shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Offering\u201d). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 Common Shares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering.\nFull Redemption of Convertible Debentures\nOn July 14, 2020, the Company redeemed Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Cdn$20.86 million Convertible Debentures then outstanding for approximately $7.78 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding July 14, 2020. On October 6, 2020, the Company redeemed the remaining Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Convertible Debentures then outstanding for\napproximately $7.82 million. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding October 6, 2020. As a result of the final redemption, no Convertible Debentures are outstanding or subject to the terms of the Indenture, and the Convertible Debentures have ceased to be listed on the TSX. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements: Loans and Borrowings.\u201d The Company decided to redeem all of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity because the U.S.-Canada currency exchange rate was favorable, the Company had sufficient cash available, and the Company avoided approximately US$0.46 million in interest payments in 2020 by doing so. By proactively managing its outstanding indebtedness in this way, the Company was able to redeem the Convertible Debentures on the Company's own timing and terms and with minimal market disruption. The Company currently has no other remaining short- or long-term debt.\nAgreement to Acquire Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) Borehole Logging Technology and Equipment\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire from GeoInstruments Logging LLC ( GIL\u201d) all of its Prompt Fission Neutron ( PFN\u201d) technology and equipment, including all of its related intellectual property, giving Energy Fuels the exclusive right to use, license, and service this particular PFN technology globally. PFN is critical to successful uranium production particularly from many in situ recovery ( ISR\u201d) deposits, as it more accurately measures downhole in-situ U3O8 ore grade versus traditional Total Gamma and Spectral Gamma methods. On July 31, 2020, the parties closed the transaction and all such equipment and technology was transferred to the Company.\nThe PFN equipment and technology acquired by Energy Fuels includes: four (4) PFN tools; nine (9) gamma tools; two (2) low-mileage, heavy-duty logging trucks with logging and associated equipment; power supplies, computers, communication, and other technology; and all associated intellectual property, and the sole right to utilize and license the acquired PFN technology globally. The total consideration paid by Energy Fuels to GIL was $0.5 million cash.\nEnergy Fuels currently has some PFN equipment in various states of repair, which it has used for its mining operations in the past, as do other companies in the U.S. and around the world. With the acquisition of this additional PFN equipment and technology from GIL, Energy Fuels is not only able to utilize the additional equipment to ramp-up production from its ISR properties more quickly and efficiently in the event of improved market conditions, but has also secured the ability to service, repair and maintain PFN equipment currently held by the Company and others, as well as license this technology to others in the future.\nUpdate on Rare Earth Element Initiative\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company announced its intent to enter the REE market following several months of review and testing, including discussions with various technical experts and the U.S. government. The U.S. government is actively seeking a domestic source of REE minerals, which are needed for national defense among other applications.\nREEs are a group of 17 chemical elements (the 15 elements in the lanthanum series, plus yttrium and scandium) that have a variety of industrial, energy, military and defense uses, including automotive components, communications technology, clean energy production, consumer electronics, defense systems, advanced magnets, lasers and numerous other applications. According to a 2017 report by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS\u201d), China has controlled more than 90% of the global supply of REEs since the late-1990s and has placed restrictions on REE exports since 2010.\nEnergy Fuels believes the White Mesa Mill is uniquely suited to potentially receive and process a number of different types of ores for the recovery of REEs (along with uranium), which, if achievable on a commercial basis and subject to the receipt of any required license or permit amendments, would eliminate the current need to ship those ores to China for processing. If successful, the Company expects to offer customers tolling or processing arrangements at the White Mesa Mill.\nOn May 21, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into consulting agreements with Constantine Karayannopoulos and Brock O'Kelley, two REE industry experts who each have decades of experience producing commercially viable rare earth products, to aid in the development and implementation of commercial and technical REE strategies for the Company's REE program. A chemical engineer by training with more than 25 years of experience in the rare earth industry, Mr. Karayannopoulos, was at the time of the announcement Chair of Neo Performance Materials (TSX:NEO) ( Neo\u201d), one of the world's leading producers of advanced industrial materials, including rare earth-based engineered products, for multiple global markets. Mr. O'Kelley played a key role in the operation of the Mountain Pass, California rare earth processing facility during the 1990s and 2000s. Both are industry veterans with extensive knowledge of REE processing facility design, start-up, operations, and downstream value-added manufacturing of advanced REE products. On July 7, 2020, Mr. Karayannopoulos was reappointed as President and CEO of Neo. As a result of his new executive roles with Neo, his consulting agreement with the Company ended on August 6, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the Company entered into a non-exclusive Letter of Intent with Neo, under which: (i) Mr. Karayannopoulos and other Neo personnel will continue to assist Energy Fuels in developing commercial and technical aspects of the Company's REE strategy, including the potential production of a rare earth oxide concentrate at the Mill that can be sold to REE separation facilities; and (ii) the Company and Neo will work together toward potentially creating\na longer term mutually beneficial relationship, which may involve commitments to buy and sell all or a portion of the REE concentrate produced at the Mill or other commercial arrangements.\nOn December 14, 2020, the Company announced it entered into a three-year supply agreement with The Chemours Company (NYSE: CC) ( Chemours\u201d) to acquire a minimum of 2,500 tons per year of natural monazite sands, one of the highest-grade REE ores in the world, from Chemours' Offerman Mineral Sand Plant located in Georgia. The Company expects to process this monazite at the Mill, starting in 2021, to recover the contained uranium and to produce a marketable mixed REE carbonate as a step toward re-establishing a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company and Neo jointly announced that they had entered into an agreement in principle, subject to completion of definitive agreements, under which Energy Fuels will process natural monazite sands into an REE Carbonate beginning in March or April 2021 and ship a portion of that production to Neo's rare earth separations facility in Sillam\u00e4e, Estonia (\"Silmet\"). Neo will then process the REE Carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth-based advanced materials. Silmet is the only operational rare earth separations facility in Europe and has been separating rare earths into commercial value-added products for more than 50 years. Implementation of this initiative is subject to successful ramp-up to commercial-scale operations, execution of definitive agreements, and optimization of the companies' production processes.\nUpon a successful ramp-up of this program, the Company will be the first U.S. company in several years to produce a marketable mixed REE concentrate ready for separation on a commercial scale. The Company estimates that the amount of REEs contained in the monazite sands to be supplied by Chemours will equal close to 10% of total current U.S. REE demand, as contained in end-use products.\nRemoval and recovery of the uranium and other radionuclides from rare earth ores is a key aspect of Energy Fuels' value proposition, as many REE separation and recovery facilities are not able to handle those radionuclides from a technical or regulatory standpoint. The White Mesa Mill has a 40-year history of responsibly handling, processing and recycling uranium bearing materials. Therefore, it has the potential to provide a crucial link in a commercially viable U.S. REE supply chain. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company's Rare Earth Element Business, above.\nProposed Establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group Update\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company participated in the joint filing of a Petition for Relief under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten National Security (the Petition\u201d). The Petition describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China are believed to represent a threat to U.S. national security.\nOn July 18, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce ( DOC\u201d) initiated an investigation in response to the Petition (the Section 232 Investigation\u201d).\nOn April 14, 2019, the DOC completed the Section 232 Investigation, and the Secretary of Commerce submitted a report to the former President of the United States containing his findings (the Section 232 Report\u201d).\nOn July 12, 2019, in response to the Section 232 Report, former President Trump issued a memorandum, where he stated that I agree with the Secretary that the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.\u201d In order to address the concerns identified by the Secretary regarding domestic uranium production and to ensure a comprehensive review of the entire domestic nuclear supply chain,\u201d former President Trump formed the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group (the Working Group\u201d) to examine the current state of domestic nuclear fuel production to reinvigorate the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, consistent with United States national security and nonproliferation goals.\u201d Former President Trump instructed the Working Group to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production,\u201d and to submit a report to him within 90 days setting forth the Working Group's findings and making recommendations to further enable domestic nuclear fuel production if needed.\u201d\nOn February 10, 2020, the federal executive Budget for fiscal year 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021) (the Budget\u201d) was published. The Budget Supports Nuclear Fuel Cycle Capabilities,\u201d and states that [o]n July 12, 2019, the [former] President determined that \u2018...the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.' The Budget establishes a U.S. Uranium Reserve to provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.\u201d Table 25-1 of the Budget sought congressional appropriations of $150 million per year over the next 10 years (totaling $1.5 billion over that time frame) for domestic uranium purchases. For fiscal 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021), the Budget sought an appropriation of $150 million, to remain available until expended,\u201d as the appropriation for the first year of the 10-year program. The Budget further stated that Establishing a Uranium Reserve provides assurance of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption and\nsupports strategic U.S. fuel cycle capabilities. This action addresses immediate challenges to the production of domestic uranium and reflects the Administration's Nuclear Fuel Working Group (NFWG) priorities. The NFWG will continue to evaluate issues related to uranium supply chain and fuel supply.\u201d\nOn April 23, 2020, the Working Group published its report: Restoring America's Competitive Nuclear Energy Advantage: A strategy to assure U.S. national security. This comprehensive strategy sought to revive and strengthen U.S. nuclear fuel capabilities, starting with uranium mining, with the goals of supporting U.S. energy and national security, preventing geopolitical adversaries (particularly those in Russia) from using their nuclear capabilities to influence the U.S. and the world, and promoting global non-proliferation objectives and nuclear safety. The report stated that the clear outcome of the Working Group's efforts is confirmation that it is in the nation's national security interests to preserve the assets and investments of the entire U.S. nuclear enterprise and to revitalize the sector to regain U.S. global nuclear leadership.\u201d The report recommended government purchases to establish a Uranium Reserve, as contemplated by the Budget, and other actions aimed to strengthen the entire nuclear fuel cycle.\nOn December 27, 2020, the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill, which includes $75 million for the proposed establishment of a strategic U.S. Uranium Reserve, was signed into law by the United States Congress. This key funding opens the door for the U.S. government to purchase domestically-produced uranium to guard against potential commercial and national security risks presented by the country's near-total reliance on foreign imports of uranium. The Company stands ready to benefit from this program through sales out of its existing uranium inventories and future production from its mines and facilities. However, because the U.S. Uranium Reserve has yet to be established at this time, the details of implementation of activities pursuant to the new law have not yet been defined. As a result, there can be no certainty as to the outcome of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, if any, including the process for and details of its development, and any resulting support for the Company's ongoing and planned activities, or for any further evaluations of the Working Group.\nIf the uranium and vanadium markets or general market conditions do not improve, whether as a result of the establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or otherwise, the Company may further reduce its operational activities as required in order to minimize its cash expenditures while preserving its core asset base for increased production in the future, as market conditions may warrant.\nThe Company's Plans in Response to the Proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve\nIn response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, the Company is evaluating activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of its production facilities, subject to general market conditions. No decisions on any project-specific actions to be taken in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve have been made at this time.\nRenewal of the Russian Suspension Agreement\nOn September 14, 2020, the DOC announced that it had obtained Russia's agreement to extend limits on uranium imports into the U.S. from Russia through 2040 under an extended Russian Suspension Agreement. This is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry. The DOC won important concessions from Russia, including lower quotas starting in the mid-2020s, allowing only a portion of the quotas to be used for the sale of U3O8 and conversion into the U.S., and strict controls on Russian enrichment service contracts, reducing U.S. dependence on Russian uranium in the long term. While the extended Russian Suspension Agreement is an important step toward maintaining the long-term health of the U.S. uranium mining industry, it does not supplant the need for the establishment of a Uranium Reserve as proposed in the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill and as recommended by the Working Group.\nManagement Streamlining\nOn August 20, 2020, the Company announced that it was making a number of changes to its management team in order to reduce costs, flatten the organizational structure, and focus on the ongoing growth of a new generation of U.S. uranium and REE professionals, including the following, effective September 1, 2020: (a) Mr. Scott Bakken, former Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs, became the Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, responsible for permitting and regulatory matters relating to all of the Company's operations, both conventional and ISR, and also for overall worker health and safety matters at the Company; (b) Mr. Bernard Bonifas, former Director, Wyoming Operations, became the Director, ISR Operations, responsible for all of the Company's ISR operations, including its Nichols Ranch ISR project in Wyoming and its Alta Mesa ISR project in Texas; (c) Ms. Sarai Luksch, CPA, joined the Company as Controller; (d) Ms. Dee Ann Nazarenus, former Director, Human Resources & Administration, became the Vice President, Human Resources & Administration, responsible for planning, developing, organizing, implementing, directing and evaluating all human resource functions of the Company, and directing and managing all administrative functions of the Company; and (e) Mr. Logan Shumway, former Manager of the Company's\nWhite Mesa Mill, became the Director, Conventional Operations, responsible for overseeing the advancement of the Company's REE objectives, in addition to being responsible for overall White Mesa Mill management. In addition, and in support of the objective to reduce costs, effective as of August 31, 2020, former Chief Operating Officer, Mr. W. Paul Goranson left the Company to pursue other opportunities, and effective as of October 31, 2020, former Chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Matthew Tarnowski, left the Company to pursue other opportunities.\nContinued Efforts to Minimize Costs\nThe Company will continue to seek ways to minimize the costs of maintaining its critical properties in a state of readiness for potential improvements in market conditions, and is evaluating whether additional cost-cutting measures may be warranted at this time as a result of general market conditions, such as the possibility of monetizing non-core conventional assets of the Company. See ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: Potential Sale of Non-Core Assets,\u201d above.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31,

the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a net loss of $27.87 million or $0.23 per share compared with a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an operating loss of $24.63 million compared with an operating loss of $40.58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues\nPreviously, the Company's revenues from uranium were based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer had any uranium sales contacts. Any future\nsales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the Budget. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from Pond Return at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1.66 million, all of which were related to fees for ore received from a third-party uranium mine.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Return. The Company recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 from the pond solutions and alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nThere are no costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the Company did not make any concentrate sales of U3O8 or V2O5 and only collected a fee to receive ore from a third-party uranium mine for which the Company incurred de minimis costs, compared with $3.95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company spent $4.33 million for development of the Company's properties, which did not include costs associated with the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project, and significantly less costs associated with V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill, as were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $0.85 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent $9.18 million primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2020. In the beginning of 2018 as well as the beginning of 2020, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, standby costs totaled $4.02 million compared with $2.58 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to a reduction in recovery activities at Nichols Ranch as it was placed on standby during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and prolonged periods of standby at the Mill. As a result of a downward revision to the Company's asset retirement obligation estimates, approximately $7.00 million was recorded as an offset to these expenses.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.91 million compared with the prior year of $1.93 million, primarily due to changes in timing of estimated reclamation activities at some of the Company's projects.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate, general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.38 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred approximately $1.04 million in one-time management streamlining restructuring expenses.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $1.64 million and $14.35 million, respectively, in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium and vanadium prices versus our cost to produce. The decrease in impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to lower production levels as well as improved uranium prices.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.95 million compared with $1.49 million in the prior year due to early redemption of the Convertible Debentures prior to maturity.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other expenses net of other income totaled $2.29 million. These amounts primarily consist of a mark-to-market loss on the increase in fair value of warrant liabilities of $5.44 million, offset by a $1.84 million mark-to-market gain on investments accounted for at fair value, a gain on foreign exchange of $0.77 million, a mark-to-market gain on the change in the fair value of the Convertible Debentures of $0.16 million, interest income of $0.15 million, and other of $0.23 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income net of other expenses totaled $3.98 million. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a net loss of $38.09 million or $0.40 per share compared with a net loss of $25.36 million or $0.30 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an operating loss of $40.58 million compared with an operating loss of $21.31 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nThe Company's revenues from uranium were previously based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts, which could vary from quarter to quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the Company no longer has any uranium sales contacts. Any future sales of uranium will be subject to sale in the spot market until a time when the Company can agree to terms for long-term sales contracts or potentially pursuant to direct government purchases as contemplated by the proposed Uranium Reserve. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company initiated the selling of vanadium recovered from its pond solution at the White Mesa Mill under a Sales and Agency Agreement appointing an exclusive sales and marketing agent for all vanadium pentoxide produced by the Company.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $5.87 million, of which $2.24 million was related to sales of approximately 202,000 pounds of vanadium concentrates and $3.56 million was related to toll processing of uranium concentrates and fees for ore received from third-party uranium mines.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $31.72 million, of which $30.79 million was related to sales of 650,000 pounds of U3O8, which included the sale of 450,000 pounds of U3O8 pursuant to term contracts at an average price of\n$57.24 per pound and the sale of 200,000 pounds of U3O8 into contracts based on spot market prices at an average price of $25.16 per pound.\nOperating Expenses\nUranium and Vanadium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recovered approximately 70,000 pounds of U3O8 from ISR recovery activities for the Company's own account and approximately 1,807,000 pounds of V2O5 from Pond Returns.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recovered 917,000 pounds of U3O8 of which 493,000 pounds were for the Company's own account and 424,000 pounds were for the account of a tolling customer. Of the 493,000 pounds recovered for its own account, 137,000 pounds were from alternate feed sources, 216,000 pounds were from uranium recovered from existing tailings pond solutions at the White Mesa Mill, and 140,000 pounds were from ISR recovery activities.\nCosts and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $3.95 million, compared with $14.75 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in cost and expenses applicable to revenue is $2.08 million and nil related to toll processing and other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $1.81 million from V2O5 and $2.08 million related to alternate feed materials. All costs and expenses applicable to revenue for 2018 were related to uranium concentrates.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nDevelopment, permitting and land holding\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company spent $9.18 million for development of the Company's properties. This is primarily due to the development of the V2O5 test-mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with ramping up V2O5 production at the White Mesa Mill.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $9.91 million for development, permitting and land holding, comprised of the acquisition of royalties, the development of the Pinyon Plain Project and permitting and land holding costs related to the Pinyon Plain Project, development of the V2O5 test mining program at the La Sal Project as well as expenses associated with preparing the White Mesa Mill for V2O5 production.\nWhile we expect the amounts relative to the items listed above have added future value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at any of the Company's projects under SEC Industry Guide 7.\nStandby costs\nThe Company's La Sal, Daneros, and Arizona 1 Projects were on standby during the three years ended December 31, 2019. In the beginning of 2018, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, standby costs totaled $2.58 million compared with $5.11 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to vanadium recovery activities at the White Mesa Mill.\nAccretion\nAccretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company's properties increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.93 million compared with the prior year of $1.84 million, primarily due to normal accretion activity.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate and general and administrative costs and intangible asset amortization from favorable contracts. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel, contract and professional services, share-based compensation expense and other overhead expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $14.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is a result of the Company not recognizing any intangible amortization cost from favorable contracts in the year ended December 31, 2019 as the Company does not have any additional contract sales, offset by an increase in spending on the Section 232 Petition and related Working Group activities of $0.77 million.\nImpairment of Inventories\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $14.35 million in impairment charges related to inventory to value such inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and included in impairment charges were depreciation expenses of $2.09 million. The impairment of inventories is due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project of $4.48 million, the decrease in the market price of vanadium recovered from Pond Return of $8.62 million and the decrease in the market price of vanadium in the La Sal stockpile of $1.25 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $4.58 million in inventory impairment due to continued lower uranium prices versus our cost to produce at the Nichols Ranch Project. Included in impairment were depreciation expenses of $2.05 million.\nInterest Expense and Other Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.49 million compared with $1.72 million in the prior year due to lower principal amounts from the repayment of Wyoming revenue bond loan and the put option conversion of the Convertible Debentures.\nOther income and expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income and expense totaled $3.98 million income, net. These amounts primarily consist of a gain on the change in the mark-to-market values of the Convertible Debentures of $0.29 million, a gain on the decrease in value of warrant liabilities of $3.73 million, and interest income of $0.48 million, offset by $0.15 million loss in investments accounted for at fair value and other of $0.32 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income and expense totaled $2.33 million expense, net. These amounts consist of a loss for the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $3.47 million and a loss in the mark-to-market values of the Company's Convertible Debentures of $0.61 million, partially offset by interest income of $0.34 million, sales of surplus assets of $0.29 million, gain of assets held for sale of $0.34 million and a $0.77 million increase in the value of investments accounted for at fair value.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFunding of major business and property acquisitions\nOver the past eight years the Company has funded major business and property acquisitions with capital provided by issuances of its Common Shares. In 2012, we acquired Titan Uranium Inc. and the U.S. Mining Division of Denison Mines Corp., in 2013 we acquired Strathmore Minerals Corp, in 2015 we acquired Uranerz and in 2016 we acquired Meste\u00f1a, each in exchange for newly issued shares.\nWe intend to continue to acquire assets utilizing Common Shares when we can do so under attractive terms.\nShares issued for cash\nOn December 23, 2016, the Company filed a prospectus supplement in both Canada and the United States to its Canadian base shelf prospectus and U.S. registration statement on Form S-3, which enabled the Company, at its discretion from time to time, to sell up to $20 million worth of Common Shares by way of an at-the-market\u201d offering (the ATM\u201d). On December 29, 2017, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On November 5, 2018, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. Then, on the same date, the Company filed a base shelf prospectus whereby the Company may sell any combination of the Securities\u201d as defined thereunder in one or more offerings up to an initial aggregate offering amount of $150.00 million. On May 5, 2019, the prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement expired, and was replaced on May 7, 2019 by a new prospectus supplement in the same amount, qualifying for distribution up to $24.50 million in aggregate Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2019, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $30.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM. On December 31, 2020, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement, qualifying for distribution up to $35.00 million in additional Common Shares under the ATM.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of common shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the \"Offering\"). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 common\nshares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering (see Note 12 to the Financial Statements: Capital Stock\u201d).\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 18, 2021, the Company issued 5.50 million Common Shares at a weighted-average price of $5.53 for net proceeds of $29.70 million using the ATM.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2020 and future requirements for funds\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $40.16 million, including $20.17 million in cash, $2.25 million of marketable securities, approximately 690,700 pounds of uranium finished goods inventory and approximately 1,672,000 pounds of vanadium finished goods inventory. The Company believes it has sufficient cash and resources to carry out its business plan for at least the next twelve months.\nThe Company is actively focused on its forward-looking liquidity needs, especially in light of the current depressed uranium markets. The Company is evaluating its ongoing fixed cost structure as well as decisions related to project retention, advancement and development. If current uranium prices persist for any extended period of time, the Company will likely be required to raise capital or take other measures to fund its ongoing operations. Significant development activities, if warranted, will require that we arrange for financing in advance of planned expenditures. In addition, we expect to continue to augment our current financial resources with external financing as our long-term business needs require. We cannot provide any assurance that we will pursue any of these transactions or that we will be successful in completing them on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its working capital and its capital structure.\nCash and cash flows\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $40.99 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $32.89 million at December 31, 2019.
