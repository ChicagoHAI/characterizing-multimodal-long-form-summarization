Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAmerica's Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the Company\u201d), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance\u201d segment of the used car market. References to the Company include the Company's consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America's Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Car-Mart of Arkansas\u201d), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Colonial\u201d). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as Car-Mart.\u201d The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company's customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2016, the Company operated 143 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nCar-Mart has been operating since 1981. Car-Mart has grown its revenues between approximately 3% and 14% per year over the last ten years (average 9%). Growth results from same dealership revenue growth and the addition of new dealerships. Revenue increased 7.1% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price and a 6.3% increase in interest income.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td>20 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company earns revenue from the sale of used vehicles, and in most cases a related service contract and a payment protection plan product, as well as interest income and late fees from the related financing. The Company's cost structure is more fixed in nature and is sensitive to volume changes. Revenues can be affected by our level of competition, which is influenced to a large extent by the availability of funding to the sub-prime automobile industry, together with the availability and resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Revenues can also be affected by the macro-economic environment. Down payments, contract term lengths and proprietary credit scoring are critical to helping customers succeed and are monitored closely by corporate management at the point of sale. After the sale, collections, delinquencies and charge-offs are crucial elements of the Company's evaluation of its financial condition and results of operations and are monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis. Management believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers and earning their repeat business is critical to the success and growth of the Company and can serve to offset the effects of increased competition and negative macro-economic factors.\nA challenging competitive environment puts pressure on sales volumes especially at older dealerships which tend to have higher overall sales volumes and more repeat customers. Additionally, as the Company attempts to attract and retain target customers, increased competition can contribute to lower down payments and longer contract terms which can have a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses. Management believes that the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with a lack of other investment alternatives has been attracting excess capital into the sub-prime automobile market and increasing competition. In an effort to combat the increased competition the Company will continue to focus on the benefits of excellent customer service and its local\u201d face to face offering in an effort to help customers succeed. The Company has also focused additional attention on selling lower priced vehicles to increase affordability for customers, to address sales volume challenges and to improve credit performance in the future by improving the equity position of customers who may be tempted to default on their contracts especially when competition on the lending side is elevated.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for its vehicles can also have a significant effect on revenues, liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost of the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. As we have seen in recent years, decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, leads to decreased supply and generally increased prices in the used car market. Also, expansions or constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can have an overall effect on the demand and the resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale.\nThe Company's primary focus is on collections. Each dealership is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office. Over the last five fiscal years, the Company's credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from approximately 21.1% in fiscal 2012 to 28.5% in fiscal 2016 (average of 25.1%). The Company's credit losses for fiscal 2012 were 21.1% of sales which was within the range of credit losses that the Company targeted annually at that time. Credit losses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013, however, increased to 23.1%, primarily due to increased contract term lengths and lower down payments resulting from increased competitive pressures as well as higher charge-offs caused, to an extent, by negative macro-economic factors affecting the Company's customer base. These competitive pressures intensified in fiscal 2014 and, along with a continued challenging macro-economic environment for our customers, further impacted the Company's credit losses in fiscal 2014 through lower finance receivables collections and higher charge-offs, coupled with the effect of lower wholesale sales. Credit losses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 and 2016 were 25.5% and 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2016), respectively, as competitive pressures remained elevated and the increased number of newer dealerships weighed on credit loss results.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>21 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover credit losses inherent in its contract portfolio. The allowance for credit losses historically remained at 22.0% of finance receivables from October 2006 until April 30, 2012, when management reduced the allowance to 21.5% of finance receivables based on the Company's then recent credit loss experience. However, as a result of the increased credit losses during fiscal 2013 and with the expectation that charge-offs would remain elevated, management increased the allowance for credit losses to 23.5% of the finance receivables principal balance, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue, at January 31, 2014. The allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2015 was 23.8% of finance receivables, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue and deferred service contract revenue. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses did not previously include a reduction for the deferred service contract revenue. This change did not have a material impact on net income or earnings per share and was not significant to any prior period. As of October 31, 2015, management increased the allowance to 25.0% due to continued increased credit losses and the expectation that such activity would continue.\nHistorically, credit losses, on a percentage basis, tend to be higher at new and developing dealerships than at mature dealerships. Generally, this is the case because the management at new and developing dealerships tends to be less experienced in making credit decisions and collecting customer accounts and the customer base is less seasoned. Normally more mature dealerships have more repeat customers and, on average, repeat customers are a better credit risk than non-repeat customers. Negative macro-economic issues do not always lead to higher credit loss results for the Company because the Company provides basic affordable transportation which in many cases is not a discretionary expenditure for customers. The Company does believe, however, that general inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries and gasoline, as well as overall unemployment levels and potentially lower or stagnant personal income levels affecting customers can have, and has had in recent years, a negative impact on collections. Additionally, increased competition for used vehicle financing can have, and management believes is currently having, a negative effect on collections and charge-offs.\nIn an effort to offset the elevated credit losses and lower collection levels and to operate more efficiently, the Company continues to look for improvements to its business practices, including better underwriting and better collection procedures. The Company has a proprietary credit scoring system which enables the Company to monitor the quality of contracts. Corporate office personnel monitor proprietary credit scores and work with dealerships when the distribution of scores falls outside of prescribed thresholds. The Company has implemented credit reporting and the use of global positioning system ( GPS\u201d) units on vehicles. Additionally, the Company has placed significant focus on the collection area as the Company's training department continues to spend significant time and effort on collections improvements. The Support Operations Officer oversees the collections department and provides timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. In addition, the Company has a Director of Collection Services who assists with managing the Company's servicing and collections practices and provides additional monitoring and training. Also, turnover at the dealership level for collections positions is down compared to historical levels, which management believes has a positive effect on collection results. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of its long term credit loss experience.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>22 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHistorically, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year. Over the previous five fiscal years, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales ranged between approximately 40% and 43%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 was 39.8%. The Company's gross margins are based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased, with lower-priced vehicles typically having higher gross margin percentages. Gross margins in recent years have been negatively affected by the increase in the average retail sales price (a function of a higher purchase price) and higher operating costs, mostly related to increased vehicle repair costs and higher fuel costs. Additionally, the percentage of wholesale sales to retail sales, which relate for the most part to repossessed vehicles sold at or near cost, can have a significant effect on overall gross margins. The gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by higher wholesale sales, increased average retail selling price, higher inventory repair costs and lower margins on the payment protection plan and service contract products. Gross margin improved slightly in fiscal 2013 due to improved wholesale results partially offset by higher losses under the payment protection plan. The gross margin for fiscal 2014 was affected by higher inventory repair costs resulting from continued efforts to help our customers succeed and to meet competitive pressures and higher claims under the payment protection plan. Gross margins as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2016, gross margin decreased to 39.8% of sales primarily due to the high level of repossession activity, as both the volume of wholesale sales and the prices received from wholesale sales had a negative effect on overall gross margins, as did higher repair expenses. The Company expects that its gross margin percentage will continue to remain under pressure over the near term.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified associates is critical to the Company's success. The rate at which the Company adds new dealerships and is able to implement operating initiatives is limited by the number of trained managers and support personnel the Company has at its disposal. Excessive turnover, particularly at the dealership manager level, could impact the Company's ability to add new dealerships and to meet operational initiatives. The Company has added resources to recruit, train, and develop personnel, especially personnel targeted to fill dealership manager positions. The Company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>23 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Operations\n(Operating Statement Dollars in

7.1%, in fiscal 2016, as compared to revenue growth of 8.4% in fiscal 2015, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($14.0 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 ($14.6 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2015 ($9.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 is attributable to (i) a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price, and (ii) a 6.3% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased to 60.2% in fiscal 2016 from 57.7% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average purchase cost of vehicles sold relative to the increase in average retail sales price, along with higher repair costs. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2016 was $10,361, a $681 increase over the prior fiscal year. As purchase costs increase, the margin between the purchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles we sell narrows as a percentage because the Company must offer affordable prices to our customers. The increased purchase costs are the result of a combination of consumer demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale, which remains high relative to supply, and a strategic management decision to purchase higher quality vehicles for our customers. The high demand and tight supply of the vehicles we purchase for resale are largely related to excess funding to the used vehicle financing market and the depressed levels of new car sales during and after the recession, although more robust new car sales in recent years have begun to bolster the supply of used vehicles. Finally, increases in the volume of wholesales sales, resulting from higher credit losses, also increase our cost of sales and thus negatively affect our gross margin percentages. We will continue to focus efforts on minimizing the average retail sales price of our vehicles in order to help keep contract terms shorter, which helps customers to maintain appropriate equity in their vehicles and reduces credit losses and resulting wholesale volumes.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5% to 18.2% in fiscal 2016 from 17.7% in fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.4 million from fiscal 2015, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the second quarter) for fiscal 2016 compared to 25.5% for fiscal 2015. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to 31.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 27.8% for the prior year. Continuing macro-economic challenges and competitive conditions continue to put pressure on our customers and the resulting collections of our finance receivables, although the lower gas prices during fiscal 2016 have provided some relief to our customers. The Company has implemented several operational initiatives (including credit reporting and the use of GPS units on vehicles) to improve collections and continually pushes for improvements and better execution of its collection practices. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of credit loss experience and that the negative impact on credit losses in both the current and prior year periods resulting from negative macro-economic and competitive pressures has been somewhat mitigated by the improvements in oversight and accountability provided by the Company's investments in our corporate infrastructure within the collections area.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 0.7% compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2015, due to higher average borrowings during the fiscal year 2016 ($109.0 million compared to $102.2 million in the prior year).\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased $41.1 million, or 8.4%, in fiscal 2015, as compared to revenue growth of 5.3% in fiscal 2014, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($13.7 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014 ($20.4 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2014 ($7.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2015 is attributable to (i) a 9.9% increase in retail unit volumes, and (ii) a 5.6% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, remained flat at 57.7% in fiscal 2015 from 57.8% in fiscal 2014. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2015 was $9,680, an $88 decrease over the prior fiscal year. Average selling prices and top line sales levels in relation to wholesale volumes, resulting from credit loss experience, can have a significant effect on gross margin percentages.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased 0.4% to 17.7% in fiscal 2015 from 18.1% in fiscal 2014. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million from fiscal 2014, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 27.4% (25.7% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the third quarter) for fiscal 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 27.8% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% for the prior year. The decrease primarily resulted from a lower frequency of losses, partially offset by an increase in the severity of losses. The higher severity of losses primarily resulted from lower wholesale values at time of repossession.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 0.6% compared 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Lower average borrowings during the fiscal year 2015 ($102.2 million compared to $103.0 million in the prior year) were partially offset by higher interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the Company at April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finance receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,299 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Inventory </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Property and equipment, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts payable and accrued liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes payable (receivable), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(894 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(645 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred income tax liabilities, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facilities and notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows receivables growth compared to revenue growth during each of the past three fiscal years. For fiscal year 2016, revenue growth exceeded growth in net finance receivables primarily due to higher charge-offs and the resulting increase in wholesale sales, which weighed on finance receivables growth, while higher interest income augmented growth in revenue. The Company currently anticipates going forward that the growth in finance receivables will generally be slightly higher than overall revenue growth on an annual basis due to overall term length increases partially offset by improvements in underwriting and collection procedures in an effort to reduce credit losses. The average term for installment sales contracts at April 30, 2016 was 31.6 months compared to 30.2 months at April 30, 2015.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Growth in finance receivables, net of deferred revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, inventory decreased 12.8% ($4.4 million). The decrease resulted primarily from a concerted company-wide effort to retain only the best quality vehicles. The Company will continue to manage inventory levels in the future to ensure adequate supply of vehicles, in volume and mix, and to meet sales demand.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty and equipment, net, increased by approximately $792,000 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The Company incurred $4.5 million in expenditures related to new dealerships as well as to refurbish and expand a number of existing locations, offset by depreciation expense.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased approximately $172,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to decreased payables related to decreased inventory levels as well as the amount and timing of cash overdrafts.\nIncome taxes receivable, net, increased approximately $249,000 at April 30, 2016 compared to April 30, 2015 primarily due to the timing of income tax payments and refunds.\nDeferred revenue increased $2.1 million in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015, primarily resulting from the longer term on the payment protection product due to increased contract terms, as well as the increase in the term and pricing of the service contract product.\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net, decreased approximately $898,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to the change in finance receivables and the book/tax difference on stock based compensation.\nBorrowings on the Company's revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily based upon a number of factors including (i) net income, (ii) finance receivables changes, (iii) income taxes, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) common stock repurchases. Historically, income from continuing operations, as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, have funded the Company's finance receivables growth, capital asset purchases and common stock repurchases. In fiscal 2016 the Company had a $4.7 million net increase in total revolving debt used to contribute to the funding of finance receivables growth of $19.9 million, net capital expenditures of $4.5 million and common stock repurchases of $14.2 million.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain historical

finance receivables, (iii) gross margin percentages on vehicle sales, and (iv) credit losses, a significant portion of which relates to the collection of principal on finance receivables. The Company generates cash flow from income from operations. Historically, most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases. To the extent finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases exceed income from operations the Company generally increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. The majority of the Company's growth has been self-funded.\nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily as a result of (i) a higher non-cash charge for credit losses and (ii) higher finance receivable collections, partially offset by (iii) lower net income and (iv) an increase in finance receivables originations. Finance receivables, net, increased by $19.9 million during fiscal 2016.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were positively impacted by (i) higher net income, (ii) an increase in deferred income taxes, (iii) higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, (iv) higher non-cash charges including credit losses, depreciation, and losses on claims for payment protection plan, partially offset by (v) an increase in finance receivables, net and (vi) an increase in inventory. Finance receivables, net, increased by $30.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for a vehicle has a significant effect on liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost for the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. Several external factors can negatively affect the purchase cost of vehicles. Decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, lead to decreased supply in the used car market. Also, constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can increase overall demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale as used vehicles become more attractive than new vehicles in times of economic instability. A negative shift in used vehicle supply, combined with strong demand, results in increased used vehicle prices and thus higher purchase costs for the Company.\nNew vehicle sales decreased dramatically beginning with the economic recession of 2008. While sales levels for new vehicles have risen steadily since 2009, new vehicle sales volumes only returned to pre-recession levels during fiscal 2016. In addition, the challenging macro-economic environment, together with the constriction in consumer credit starting in 2008, contributed to increased demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases and a resulting increase in used car prices. These negative macro-economic conditions have continued to affect our customers in the years since the recession and, in turn, have helped keep demand high for the types of vehicles we purchase. This increased demand, coupled with depressed levels of new vehicle sales in recent years, negatively impacted both the quality and the quantity of the used vehicle supply available to the Company. Management expects the tight supply of vehicles and resulting increases in vehicle purchase costs to continue, although some relief is expected as a result of steady increases in new car sales levels in recent periods.\nThe Company has devoted significant efforts to improving its purchasing processes to ensure adequate supply at appropriate prices, including expanding its purchasing territories to larger cities in close proximity to its dealerships and increasing its efforts to purchase vehicles from individuals at the dealership level as well as via the internet. The Company has also increased the level of accountability for its purchasing agents including the establishment of sourcing and pricing guidelines. Even with these efforts, the Company expects gross margin percentages to remain under pressure over the near term.\nThe Company believes that the amount of credit available for the sub-prime auto industry has increased in recent years and management expects the availability of consumer credit within the automotive industry to be higher over the near term when compared to historical levels. This is expected to contribute to continued strong overall demand for most, if not all, of the vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Increased competition resulting from availability of funding to the sub-prime auto industry has contributed to lower down payments and longer terms, which have had a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses when compared to prior periods.\nMacro-economic factors can have an effect on credit losses and resulting liquidity. General inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries, as well as overall unemployment levels can have a significant effect on collection results and ultimately credit losses. The Company has made improvements to its business processes within the last few years to strengthen controls and provide stronger infrastructure to support its collections efforts. The Company anticipates that credit losses in the near term will be higher than historical ranges due to significant continued macro-economic challenges for the Company's customer base as well as increased competitive pressures. Management continues to focus on improved execution at the dealership level, specifically as related to working individually with customers concerning collection issues.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has generally leased the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located. As of April 30, 2016, the Company leased approximately 85% of its dealership properties. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located.\nThe Company's revolving credit facilities generally restrict distributions by the Company to its shareholders. The distribution limitations under the Credit Facilities allow the Company to repurchase the Company's stock so long as: either (a) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed $40 million beginning October 8, 2014 and the sum of borrowing bases combined minus the principal balances of all revolver loans after giving effect to such repurchases is equal to or greater than 30% of the sum of the borrowing bases, or (b) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed 75% of the consolidated net income of the Company measured on a trailing twelve month basis; provided that immediately before and after giving effect to the stock repurchases, at least 12.5% of the aggregate funds committed under the credit facilities remain available. Thus, although the Company currently does routinely repurchase stock, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company's lenders.\nAt April 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $602,000 of cash on hand and $61 million of availability under its revolving credit facilities (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). On a short-term basis, the Company's principal sources of liquidity include income from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. On a longer-term basis, the Company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from operations and borrowings under revolving credit facilities or fixed interest term loans. The Company's revolving credit facilities mature in October 2017 and the Company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facilities on or before the date they mature. Furthermore, while the Company has no specific plans to issue debt or equity securities, the Company believes, if necessary, it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities.\nThe Company expects to use cash from operations and borrowings to (i) grow its finance receivables portfolio, (ii) purchase property and equipment of approximately $2.2 million in the next 12 months in connection with refurbishing existing dealerships and adding new dealerships, subject to strong operating results, (iii) repurchase shares of common stock when favorable conditions exist and (iv) reduce debt to the extent excess cash is available.\nThe Company believes it will have adequate liquidity to continue to grow its revenues and to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's contractual payment obligations as of April 30, 2016, including renewal periods under operating leases that are reasonably assured (in thousands):\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving lines of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,621 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above excludes estimated interest payments on the Company's revolving lines of credit. The $46.7 million of operating lease commitments includes $16.2 million of non-cancelable lease commitments under the lease terms, and $30.5 million of lease commitments for renewal periods at the Company's option that are reasonably assured.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for approximately 85% of its dealership and office facilities. Generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options. The Company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its dealership locations and to preserve capital. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of its dealership and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past. For the years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately $6.1 million, $5.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company has a standby letter of credit relating to an insurance policy totaling $1 million at April 30, 2016.\nOther than its operating leases and the letter of credit, the Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRelated Finance Company Contingency\nCar-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns. Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price. These types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection for the Company's finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of Colonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company's overall effective state income tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. The actual interpretation of the Regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the Regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company's overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments.\nThe Company's policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of April 30, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company's estimates. The Company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses, which is discussed below. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date in the collection of its finance receivables currently outstanding. At April 30, 2016, the weighted average total contract term was 31.6 months with 23.2 months remaining. The reserve amount in the allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2016, $102.5 million, was 25.0% of the principal balance in finance receivables of $437.3 million, less unearned payment protection plan revenue of $17.3 million and unearned service contract revenue of $10.0 million.\nThe estimated reserve amount is the Company's anticipated future net charge-offs for losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The allowance takes into account historical credit loss experience (both timing and severity of losses), with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in contract characteristics (i.e., average amount financed, months outstanding at loss date, term and age of portfolio), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by management with any changes reflected in current operations. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses uses the following primary factors:\nTable 69: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The number of units repossessed or charged-off as a percentage of total units financed over specific historical periods of time from one year to five years. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The average net repossession and charge-off loss per unit during the last eighteen months, segregated by the number of months since the contract origination date, and adjusted for the expected future average net charge-off loss per unit. Approximately 50% of the charge-offs that will ultimately occur in the portfolio are expected to occur within 10-11 months following the balance sheet date. The average age of an account at charge-off date is 11.7 months. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The timing of repossession and charge-off losses relative to the date of sale (i.e., how long it takes for a repossession or charge-off to occur) for repossessions and charge-offs occurring during the last eighteen months. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA point estimate is produced by this analysis which is then supplemented by any positive or negative subjective factors to arrive at an overall reserve amount that management considers to be a reasonable estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be realized via actual charge-offs in the future. Although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen which could cause actual credit losses to be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses, the Company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and has made reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses. While challenging economic conditions can negatively impact credit losses, the effectiveness of the execution of internal policies and procedures within the collections area and the competitive environment on the funding side have historically had a more significant effect on collection results than macro-economic issues. A 1% change, as a percentage of Finance receivables, in the allowance for credit losses would equate to an approximate pre-tax change of $4.1 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOccasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies which the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes the impact of recently issued standards which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nDebt Issuance Costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. This accounting standard was implemented by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result of the application of this accounting standard, the Company has provided additional disclosures in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance in ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, to provide entities with an additional year to implement ASU 2014-09. As a result, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of the adoption of this update on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLeases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The new guidance requires that lessees recognize all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on-balance sheet and also requires disclosure of key information about leasing transactions. The guidance in ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of the adoption of this guidance on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has not historically been a significant factor impacting the Company's results; however, recent purchase price increases for vehicles, most pronounced over the last four fiscal years, have had a negative effect on the Company's gross margin percentages when compared to past years. This is due to the fact that the Company focuses on keeping payments affordable for its customer base and at the same time ensuring that the term of the contract matches the economic life of the vehicle.", "summary": "- The accompanying table provides information on the Company's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and for the three months ended December 31, 2011

7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAmerica's Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the Company\u201d), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance\u201d segment of the used car market. References to the Company include the Company's consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America's Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Car-Mart of Arkansas\u201d), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Colonial\u201d). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as Car-Mart.\u201d The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company's customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2016, the Company operated 143 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nCar-Mart has been operating since 1981. Car-Mart has grown its revenues between approximately 3% and 14% per year over the last ten years (average 9%). Growth results from same dealership revenue growth and the addition of new dealerships. Revenue increased 7.1% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price and a 6.3% increase in interest income.\n 20 \nThe Company earns revenue from the sale of used vehicles, and in most cases a related service contract and a payment protection plan product, as well as interest income and late fees from the related financing. The Company's cost structure is more fixed in nature and is sensitive to volume changes. Revenues can be affected by our level of competition, which is influenced to a large extent by the availability of funding to the sub-prime automobile industry, together with the availability and resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Revenues can also be affected by the macro-economic environment. Down payments, contract term lengths and proprietary credit scoring are critical to helping customers succeed and are monitored closely by corporate management at the point of sale. After the sale, collections, delinquencies and charge-offs are crucial elements of the Company's evaluation of its financial condition and results of operations and are monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis. Management believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers and earning their repeat business is critical to the success and growth of the Company and can serve to offset the effects of increased competition and negative macro-economic factors.\nA challenging competitive environment puts pressure on sales volumes especially at older dealerships which tend to have higher overall sales volumes and more repeat customers. Additionally, as the Company attempts to attract and retain target customers, increased competition can contribute to lower down payments and longer contract terms which can have a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses. Management believes that the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with a lack of other investment alternatives has been attracting excess capital into the sub-prime automobile market and increasing competition. In an effort to combat the increased competition the Company will continue to focus on the benefits of excellent customer service and its local\u201d face to face offering in an effort to help customers succeed. The Company has also focused additional attention on selling lower priced vehicles to increase affordability for customers, to address sales volume challenges and to improve credit performance in the future by improving the equity position of customers who may be tempted to default on their contracts especially when competition on the lending side is elevated.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for its vehicles can also have a significant effect on revenues, liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost of the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. As we have seen in recent years, decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, leads to decreased supply and generally increased prices in the used car market. Also, expansions or constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can have an overall effect on the demand and the resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale.\nThe Company's primary focus is on collections. Each dealership is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office. Over the last five fiscal years, the Company's credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from approximately 21.1% in fiscal 2012 to 28.5% in fiscal 2016 (average of 25.1%). The Company's credit losses for fiscal 2012 were 21.1% of sales which was within the range of credit losses that the Company targeted annually at that time. Credit losses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013, however, increased to 23.1%, primarily due to increased contract term lengths and lower down payments resulting from increased competitive pressures as well as higher charge-offs caused, to an extent, by negative macro-economic factors affecting the Company's customer base. These competitive pressures intensified in fiscal 2014 and, along with a continued challenging macro-economic environment for our customers, further impacted the Company's credit losses in fiscal 2014 through lower finance receivables collections and higher charge-offs, coupled with the effect of lower wholesale sales. Credit losses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 and 2016 were 25.5% and 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2016), respectively, as competitive pressures remained elevated and the increased number of newer dealerships weighed on credit loss results.\n 21 \nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover credit losses inherent in its contract portfolio. The allowance for credit losses historically remained at 22.0% of finance receivables from October 2006 until April 30, 2012, when management reduced the allowance to 21.5% of finance receivables based on the Company's then recent credit loss experience. However, as a result of the increased credit losses during fiscal 2013 and with the expectation that charge-offs would remain elevated, management increased the allowance for credit losses to 23.5% of the finance receivables principal balance, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue, at January 31, 2014. The allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2015 was 23.8% of finance receivables, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue and deferred service contract revenue. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses did not previously include a reduction for the deferred service contract revenue. This change did not have a material impact on net income or earnings per share and was not significant to any prior period. As of October 31, 2015, management increased the allowance to 25.0% due to continued increased credit losses and the expectation that such activity would continue.\nHistorically, credit losses, on a percentage basis, tend to be higher at new and developing dealerships than at mature dealerships. Generally, this is the case because the management at new and developing dealerships tends to be less experienced in making credit decisions and collecting customer accounts and the customer base is less seasoned. Normally more mature dealerships have more repeat customers and, on average, repeat customers are a better credit risk than non-repeat customers. Negative macro-economic issues do not always lead to higher credit loss results for the Company because the Company provides basic affordable transportation which in many cases is not a discretionary expenditure for customers. The Company does believe, however, that general inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries and gasoline, as well as overall unemployment levels and potentially lower or stagnant personal income levels affecting customers can have, and has had in recent years, a negative impact on collections. Additionally, increased competition for used vehicle financing can have, and management believes is currently having, a negative effect on collections and charge-offs.\nIn an effort to offset the elevated credit losses and lower collection levels and to operate more efficiently, the Company continues to look for improvements to its business practices, including better underwriting and better collection procedures. The Company has a proprietary credit scoring system which enables the Company to monitor the quality of contracts. Corporate office personnel monitor proprietary credit scores and work with dealerships when the distribution of scores falls outside of prescribed thresholds. The Company has implemented credit reporting and the use of global positioning system ( GPS\u201d) units on vehicles. Additionally, the Company has placed significant focus on the collection area as the Company's training department continues to spend significant time and effort on collections improvements. The Support Operations Officer oversees the collections department and provides timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. In addition, the Company has a Director of Collection Services who assists with managing the Company's servicing and collections practices and provides additional monitoring and training. Also, turnover at the dealership level for collections positions is down compared to historical levels, which management believes has a positive effect on collection results. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of its long term credit loss experience.\n 22 \nHistorically, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year. Over the previous five fiscal years, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales ranged between approximately 40% and 43%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 was 39.8%. The Company's gross margins are based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased, with lower-priced vehicles typically having higher gross margin percentages. Gross margins in recent years have been negatively affected by the increase in the average retail sales price (a function of a higher purchase price) and higher operating costs, mostly related to increased vehicle repair costs and higher fuel costs. Additionally, the percentage of wholesale sales to retail sales, which relate for the most part to repossessed vehicles sold at or near cost, can have a significant effect on overall gross margins. The gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by higher wholesale sales, increased average retail selling price, higher inventory repair costs and lower margins on the payment protection plan and service contract products. Gross margin improved slightly in fiscal 2013 due to improved wholesale results partially offset by higher losses under the payment protection plan. The gross margin for fiscal 2014 was affected by higher inventory repair costs resulting from continued efforts to help our customers succeed and to meet competitive pressures and higher claims under the payment protection plan. Gross margins as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2016, gross margin decreased to 39.8% of sales primarily due to the high level of repossession activity, as both the volume of wholesale sales and the prices received from wholesale sales had a negative effect on overall gross margins, as did higher repair expenses. The Company expects that its gross margin percentage will continue to remain under pressure over the near term.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified associates is critical to the Company's success. The rate at which the Company adds new dealerships and is able to implement operating initiatives is limited by the number of trained managers and support personnel the Company has at its disposal. Excessive turnover, particularly at the dealership manager level, could impact the Company's ability to add new dealerships and to meet operational initiatives. The Company has added resources to recruit, train, and develop personnel, especially personnel targeted to fill dealership manager positions. The Company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce.\n 23 \nConsolidated Operations\n(Operating Statement Dollars in Thousands)\n\n2016 Compared to 2015\nTotal revenues increased $37.6 million, or 7.1%, in fiscal 2016, as compared to revenue growth of 8.4% in fiscal 2015, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($14.0 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 ($14.6 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2015 ($9.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 is attributable to (i) a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price, and (ii) a 6.3% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased to 60.2% in fiscal 2016 from 57.7% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average purchase cost of vehicles sold relative to the increase in average retail sales price, along with higher repair costs. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2016 was $10,361, a $681 increase over the prior fiscal year. As purchase costs increase, the margin between the purchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles we sell narrows as a percentage because the Company must offer affordable prices to our customers. The increased purchase costs are the result of a combination of consumer demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale, which remains high relative to supply, and a strategic management decision to purchase higher quality vehicles for our customers. The high demand and tight supply of the vehicles we purchase for resale are largely related to excess funding to the used vehicle financing market and the depressed levels of new car sales during and after the recession, although more robust new car sales in recent years have begun to bolster the supply of used vehicles. Finally, increases in the volume of wholesales sales, resulting from higher credit losses, also increase our cost of sales and thus negatively affect our gross margin percentages. We will continue to focus efforts on minimizing the average retail sales price of our vehicles in order to help keep contract terms shorter, which helps customers to maintain appropriate equity in their vehicles and reduces credit losses and resulting wholesale volumes.\n 24 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5% to 18.2% in fiscal 2016 from 17.7% in fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.4 million from fiscal 2015, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the second quarter) for fiscal 2016 compared to 25.5% for fiscal 2015. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to 31.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 27.8% for the prior year. Continuing macro-economic challenges and competitive conditions continue to put pressure on our customers and the resulting collections of our finance receivables, although the lower gas prices during fiscal 2016 have provided some relief to our customers. The Company has implemented several operational initiatives (including credit reporting and the use of GPS units on vehicles) to improve collections and continually pushes for improvements and better execution of its collection practices. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of credit loss experience and that the negative impact on credit losses in both the current and prior year periods resulting from negative macro-economic and competitive pressures has been somewhat mitigated by the improvements in oversight and accountability provided by the Company's investments in our corporate infrastructure within the collections area.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 0.7% compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2015, due to higher average borrowings during the fiscal year 2016 ($109.0 million compared to $102.2 million in the prior year).\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased $41.1 million, or 8.4%, in fiscal 2015, as compared to revenue growth of 5.3% in fiscal 2014, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($13.7 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014 ($20.4 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2014 ($7.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2015 is attributable to (i) a 9.9% increase in retail unit volumes, and (ii) a 5.6% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, remained flat at 57.7% in fiscal 2015 from 57.8% in fiscal 2014. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2015 was $9,680, an $88 decrease over the prior fiscal year. Average selling prices and top line sales levels in relation to wholesale volumes, resulting from credit loss experience, can have a significant effect on gross margin percentages.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased 0.4% to 17.7% in fiscal 2015 from 18.1% in fiscal 2014. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million from fiscal 2014, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 27.4% (25.7% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the third quarter) for fiscal 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 27.8% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% for the prior year. The decrease primarily resulted from a lower frequency of losses, partially offset by an increase in the severity of losses. The higher severity of losses primarily resulted from lower wholesale values at time of repossession.\n 25 \nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 0.6% compared 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Lower average borrowings during the fiscal year 2015 ($102.2 million compared to $103.0 million in the prior year) were partially offset by higher interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the Company at April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nThe following table shows receivables growth compared to revenue growth during each of the past three fiscal years. For fiscal year 2016, revenue growth exceeded growth in net finance receivables primarily due to higher charge-offs and the resulting increase in wholesale sales, which weighed on finance receivables growth, while higher interest income augmented growth in revenue. The Company currently anticipates going forward that the growth in finance receivables will generally be slightly higher than overall revenue growth on an annual basis due to overall term length increases partially offset by improvements in underwriting and collection procedures in an effort to reduce credit losses. The average term for installment sales contracts at April 30, 2016 was 31.6 months compared to 30.2 months at April 30, 2015.\n\nIn fiscal 2016, inventory decreased 12.8% ($4.4 million). The decrease resulted primarily from a concerted company-wide effort to retain only the best quality vehicles. The Company will continue to manage inventory levels in the future to ensure adequate supply of vehicles, in volume and mix, and to meet sales demand.\n 26 \nProperty and equipment, net, increased by approximately $792,000 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The Company incurred $4.5 million in expenditures related to new dealerships as well as to refurbish and expand a number of existing locations, offset by depreciation expense.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased approximately $172,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to decreased payables related to decreased inventory levels as well as the amount and timing of cash overdrafts.\nIncome taxes receivable, net, increased approximately $249,000 at April 30, 2016 compared to April 30, 2015 primarily due to the timing of income tax payments and refunds.\nDeferred revenue increased $2.1 million in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015, primarily resulting from the longer term on the payment protection product due to increased contract terms, as well as the increase in the term and pricing of the service contract product.\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net, decreased approximately $898,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to the change in finance receivables and the book/tax difference on stock based compensation.\nBorrowings on the Company's revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily based upon a number of factors including (i) net income, (ii) finance receivables changes, (iii) income taxes, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) common stock repurchases. Historically, income from continuing operations, as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, have funded the Company's finance receivables growth, capital asset purchases and common stock repurchases. In fiscal 2016 the Company had a $4.7 million net increase in total revolving debt used to contribute to the funding of finance receivables growth of $19.9 million, net capital expenditures of $4.5 million and common stock repurchases of $14.2 million.\n 27 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\n\nThe primary drivers of operating profits and cash flows include (i) top line sales (ii) interest rates on finance receivables, (iii) gross margin percentages on vehicle sales, and (iv) credit losses, a significant portion of which relates to the collection of principal on finance receivables. The Company generates cash flow from income from operations. Historically, most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases. To the extent finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases exceed income from operations the Company generally increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. The majority of the Company's growth has been self-funded.\nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily as a result of (i) a higher non-cash charge for credit losses and (ii) higher finance receivable collections, partially offset by (iii) lower net income and (iv) an increase in finance receivables originations. Finance receivables, net, increased by $19.9 million during fiscal 2016.\n 28 \nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were positively impacted by (i) higher net income, (ii) an increase in deferred income taxes, (iii) higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, (iv) higher non-cash charges including credit losses, depreciation, and losses on claims for payment protection plan, partially offset by (v) an increase in finance receivables, net and (vi) an increase in inventory. Finance receivables, net, increased by $30.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for a vehicle has a significant effect on liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost for the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. Several external factors can negatively affect the purchase cost of vehicles. Decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, lead to decreased supply in the used car market. Also, constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can increase overall demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale as used vehicles become more attractive than new vehicles in times of economic instability. A negative shift in used vehicle supply, combined with strong demand, results in increased used vehicle prices and thus higher purchase costs for the Company.\nNew vehicle sales decreased dramatically beginning with the economic recession of 2008. While sales levels for new vehicles have risen steadily since 2009, new vehicle sales volumes only returned to pre-recession levels during fiscal 2016. In addition, the challenging macro-economic environment, together with the constriction in consumer credit starting in 2008, contributed to increased demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases and a resulting increase in used car prices. These negative macro-economic conditions have continued to affect our customers in the years since the recession and, in turn, have helped keep demand high for the types of vehicles we purchase. This increased demand, coupled with depressed levels of new vehicle sales in recent years, negatively impacted both the quality and the quantity of the used vehicle supply available to the Company. Management expects the tight supply of vehicles and resulting increases in vehicle purchase costs to continue, although some relief is expected as a result of steady increases in new car sales levels in recent periods.\nThe Company has devoted significant efforts to improving its purchasing processes to ensure adequate supply at appropriate prices, including expanding its purchasing territories to larger cities in close proximity to its dealerships and increasing its efforts to purchase vehicles from individuals at the dealership level as well as via the internet. The Company has also increased the level of accountability for its purchasing agents including the establishment of sourcing and pricing guidelines. Even with these efforts, the Company expects gross margin percentages to remain under pressure over the near term.\nThe Company believes that the amount of credit available for the sub-prime auto industry has increased in recent years and management expects the availability of consumer credit within the automotive industry to be higher over the near term when compared to historical levels. This is expected to contribute to continued strong overall demand for most, if not all, of the vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Increased competition resulting from availability of funding to the sub-prime auto industry has contributed to lower down payments and longer terms, which have had a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses when compared to prior periods.\nMacro-economic factors can have an effect on credit losses and resulting liquidity. General inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries, as well as overall unemployment levels can have a significant effect on collection results and ultimately credit losses. The Company has made improvements to its business processes within the last few years to strengthen controls and provide stronger infrastructure to support its collections efforts. The Company anticipates that credit losses in the near term will be higher than historical ranges due to significant continued macro-economic challenges for the Company's customer base as well as increased competitive pressures. Management continues to focus on improved execution at the dealership level, specifically as related to working individually with customers concerning collection issues.\n 29 \nThe Company has generally leased the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located. As of April 30, 2016, the Company leased approximately 85% of its dealership properties. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located.\nThe Company's revolving credit facilities generally restrict distributions by the Company to its shareholders. The distribution limitations under the Credit Facilities allow the Company to repurchase the Company's stock so long as: either (a) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed $40 million beginning October 8, 2014 and the sum of borrowing bases combined minus the principal balances of all revolver loans after giving effect to such repurchases is equal to or greater than 30% of the sum of the borrowing bases, or (b) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed 75% of the consolidated net income of the Company measured on a trailing twelve month basis; provided that immediately before and after giving effect to the stock repurchases, at least 12.5% of the aggregate funds committed under the credit facilities remain available. Thus, although the Company currently does routinely repurchase stock, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company's lenders.\nAt April 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $602,000 of cash on hand and $61 million of availability under its revolving credit facilities (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). On a short-term basis, the Company's principal sources of liquidity include income from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. On a longer-term basis, the Company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from operations and borrowings under revolving credit facilities or fixed interest term loans. The Company's revolving credit facilities mature in October 2017 and the Company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facilities on or before the date they mature. Furthermore, while the Company has no specific plans to issue debt or equity securities, the Company believes, if necessary, it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities.\nThe Company expects to use cash from operations and borrowings to (i) grow its finance receivables portfolio, (ii) purchase property and equipment of approximately $2.2 million in the next 12 months in connection with refurbishing existing dealerships and adding new dealerships, subject to strong operating results, (iii) repurchase shares of common stock when favorable conditions exist and (iv) reduce debt to the extent excess cash is available.\nThe Company believes it will have adequate liquidity to continue to grow its revenues and to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's contractual payment obligations as of April 30, 2016, including renewal periods under operating leases that are reasonably assured (in thousands):\n\nThe above excludes estimated interest payments on the Company's revolving lines of credit. The $46.7 million of operating lease commitments includes $16.2 million of non-cancelable lease commitments under the lease terms, and $30.5 million of lease commitments for renewal periods at the Company's option that are reasonably assured.\n 30 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for approximately 85% of its dealership and office facilities. Generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options. The Company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its dealership locations and to preserve capital. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of its dealership and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past. For the years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately $6.1 million, $5.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company has a standby letter of credit relating to an insurance policy totaling $1 million at April 30, 2016.\nOther than its operating leases and the letter of credit, the Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRelated Finance Company Contingency\nCar-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns. Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price. These types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection for the Company's finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of Colonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company's overall effective state income tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. The actual interpretation of the Regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the Regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company's overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments.\nThe Company's policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of April 30, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company's estimates. The Company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses, which is discussed below. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n 31 \nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date in the collection of its finance receivables currently outstanding. At April 30, 2016, the weighted average total contract term was 31.6 months with 23.2 months remaining. The reserve amount in the allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2016, $102.5 million, was 25.0% of the principal balance in finance receivables of $437.3 million, less unearned payment protection plan revenue of $17.3 million and unearned service contract revenue of $10.0 million.\nThe estimated reserve amount is the Company's anticipated future net charge-offs for losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The allowance takes into account historical credit loss experience (both timing and severity of losses), with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in contract characteristics (i.e., average amount financed, months outstanding at loss date, term and age of portfolio), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by management with any changes reflected in current operations. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses uses the following primary factors:\n \u00b7 The number of units repossessed or charged-off as a percentage of total units financed over specific historical periods of time from one year to five years. \n \u00b7 The average net repossession and charge-off loss per unit during the last eighteen months, segregated by the number of months since the contract origination date, and adjusted for the expected future average net charge-off loss per unit. Approximately 50% of the charge-offs that will ultimately occur in the portfolio are expected to occur within 10-11 months following the balance sheet date. The average age of an account at charge-off date is 11.7 months. \n \u00b7 The timing of repossession and charge-off losses relative to the date of sale (i.e., how long it takes for a repossession or charge-off to occur) for repossessions and charge-offs occurring during the last eighteen months. \nA point estimate is produced by this analysis which is then supplemented by any positive or negative subjective factors to arrive at an overall reserve amount that management considers to be a reasonable estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be realized via actual charge-offs in the future. Although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen which could cause actual credit losses to be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses, the Company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and has made reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses. While challenging economic conditions can negatively impact credit losses, the effectiveness of the execution of internal policies and procedures within the collections area and the competitive environment on the funding side have historically had a more significant effect on collection results than macro-economic issues. A 1% change, as a percentage of Finance receivables, in the allowance for credit losses would equate to an approximate pre-tax change of $4.1 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOccasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies which the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes the impact of recently issued standards which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nDebt Issuance Costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. This accounting standard was implemented by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result of the application of this accounting standard, the Company has provided additional disclosures in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n 32 \nRevenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance in ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAmerica's Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the Company\u201d), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance\u201d segment of the used car market. References to the Company include the Company's consolidated subsidiaries. The Company's operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America's Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Car-Mart of Arkansas\u201d), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ( Colonial\u201d). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as Car-Mart.\u201d The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company's customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2016, the Company operated 143 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nCar-Mart has been operating since 1981. Car-Mart has grown its revenues between approximately 3% and 14% per year over the last ten years (average 9%). Growth results from same dealership revenue growth and the addition of new dealerships. Revenue increased 7.1% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price and a 6.3% increase in interest income.\n 20 \nThe Company earns revenue from the sale of used vehicles, and in most cases a related service contract and a payment protection plan product, as well as interest income and late fees from the related financing. The Company's cost structure is more fixed in nature and is sensitive to volume changes. Revenues can be affected by our level of competition, which is influenced to a large extent by the availability of funding to the sub-prime automobile industry, together with the availability and resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Revenues can also be affected by the macro-economic environment. Down payments, contract term lengths and proprietary credit scoring are critical to helping customers succeed and are monitored closely by corporate management at the point of sale. After the sale, collections, delinquencies and charge-offs are crucial elements of the Company's evaluation of its financial condition and results of operations and are monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis. Management believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers and earning their repeat business is critical to the success and growth of the Company and can serve to offset the effects of increased competition and negative macro-economic factors.\nA challenging competitive environment puts pressure on sales volumes especially at older dealerships which tend to have higher overall sales volumes and more repeat customers. Additionally, as the Company attempts to attract and retain target customers, increased competition can contribute to lower down payments and longer contract terms which can have a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses. Management believes that the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with a lack of other investment alternatives has been attracting excess capital into the sub-prime automobile market and increasing competition. In an effort to combat the increased competition the Company will continue to focus on the benefits of excellent customer service and its local\u201d face to face offering in an effort to help customers succeed. The Company has also focused additional attention on selling lower priced vehicles to increase affordability for customers, to address sales volume challenges and to improve credit performance in the future by improving the equity position of customers who may be tempted to default on their contracts especially when competition on the lending side is elevated.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for its vehicles can also have a significant effect on revenues, liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost of the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. As we have seen in recent years, decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, leads to decreased supply and generally increased prices in the used car market. Also, expansions or constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can have an overall effect on the demand and the resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale.\nThe Company's primary focus is on collections. Each dealership is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office. Over the last five fiscal years, the Company's credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from approximately 21.1% in fiscal 2012 to 28.5% in fiscal 2016 (average of 25.1%). The Company's credit losses for fiscal 2012 were 21.1% of sales which was within the range of credit losses that the Company targeted annually at that time. Credit losses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013, however, increased to 23.1%, primarily due to increased contract term lengths and lower down payments resulting from increased competitive pressures as well as higher charge-offs caused, to an extent, by negative macro-economic factors affecting the Company's customer base. These competitive pressures intensified in fiscal 2014 and, along with a continued challenging macro-economic environment for our customers, further impacted the Company's credit losses in fiscal 2014 through lower finance receivables collections and higher charge-offs, coupled with the effect of lower wholesale sales. Credit losses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 and 2016 were 25.5% and 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2016), respectively, as competitive pressures remained elevated and the increased number of newer dealerships weighed on credit loss results.\n 21 \nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover credit losses inherent in its contract portfolio. The allowance for credit losses historically remained at 22.0% of finance receivables from October 2006 until April 30, 2012, when management reduced the allowance to 21.5% of finance receivables based on the Company's then recent credit loss experience. However, as a result of the increased credit losses during fiscal 2013 and with the expectation that charge-offs would remain elevated, management increased the allowance for credit losses to 23.5% of the finance receivables principal balance, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue, at January 31, 2014. The allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2015 was 23.8% of finance receivables, net of deferred payment protection plan revenue and deferred service contract revenue. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses did not previously include a reduction for the deferred service contract revenue. This change did not have a material impact on net income or earnings per share and was not significant to any prior period. As of October 31, 2015, management increased the allowance to 25.0% due to continued increased credit losses and the expectation that such activity would continue.\nHistorically, credit losses, on a percentage basis, tend to be higher at new and developing dealerships than at mature dealerships. Generally, this is the case because the management at new and developing dealerships tends to be less experienced in making credit decisions and collecting customer accounts and the customer base is less seasoned. Normally more mature dealerships have more repeat customers and, on average, repeat customers are a better credit risk than non-repeat customers. Negative macro-economic issues do not always lead to higher credit loss results for the Company because the Company provides basic affordable transportation which in many cases is not a discretionary expenditure for customers. The Company does believe, however, that general inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries and gasoline, as well as overall unemployment levels and potentially lower or stagnant personal income levels affecting customers can have, and has had in recent years, a negative impact on collections. Additionally, increased competition for used vehicle financing can have, and management believes is currently having, a negative effect on collections and charge-offs.\nIn an effort to offset the elevated credit losses and lower collection levels and to operate more efficiently, the Company continues to look for improvements to its business practices, including better underwriting and better collection procedures. The Company has a proprietary credit scoring system which enables the Company to monitor the quality of contracts. Corporate office personnel monitor proprietary credit scores and work with dealerships when the distribution of scores falls outside of prescribed thresholds. The Company has implemented credit reporting and the use of global positioning system ( GPS\u201d) units on vehicles. Additionally, the Company has placed significant focus on the collection area as the Company's training department continues to spend significant time and effort on collections improvements. The Support Operations Officer oversees the collections department and provides timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. In addition, the Company has a Director of Collection Services who assists with managing the Company's servicing and collections practices and provides additional monitoring and training. Also, turnover at the dealership level for collections positions is down compared to historical levels, which management believes has a positive effect on collection results. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of its long term credit loss experience.\n 22 \nHistorically, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year. Over the previous five fiscal years, the Company's gross margins as a percentage of sales ranged between approximately 40% and 43%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2016 was 39.8%. The Company's gross margins are based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased, with lower-priced vehicles typically having higher gross margin percentages. Gross margins in recent years have been negatively affected by the increase in the average retail sales price (a function of a higher purchase price) and higher operating costs, mostly related to increased vehicle repair costs and higher fuel costs. Additionally, the percentage of wholesale sales to retail sales, which relate for the most part to repossessed vehicles sold at or near cost, can have a significant effect on overall gross margins. The gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 was negatively affected by higher wholesale sales, increased average retail selling price, higher inventory repair costs and lower margins on the payment protection plan and service contract products. Gross margin improved slightly in fiscal 2013 due to improved wholesale results partially offset by higher losses under the payment protection plan. The gross margin for fiscal 2014 was affected by higher inventory repair costs resulting from continued efforts to help our customers succeed and to meet competitive pressures and higher claims under the payment protection plan. Gross margins as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2016, gross margin decreased to 39.8% of sales primarily due to the high level of repossession activity, as both the volume of wholesale sales and the prices received from wholesale sales had a negative effect on overall gross margins, as did higher repair expenses. The Company expects that its gross margin percentage will continue to remain under pressure over the near term.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified associates is critical to the Company's success. The rate at which the Company adds new dealerships and is able to implement operating initiatives is limited by the number of trained managers and support personnel the Company has at its disposal. Excessive turnover, particularly at the dealership manager level, could impact the Company's ability to add new dealerships and to meet operational initiatives. The Company has added resources to recruit, train, and develop personnel, especially personnel targeted to fill dealership manager positions. The Company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce.\n 23 \nConsolidated Operations\n(Operating Statement Dollars in Thousands)\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($14.0 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 ($14.6 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2015 ($9.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 is attributable to (i) a 7.0% increase in average retail sales price, and (ii) a 6.3% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased to 60.2% in fiscal 2016 from 57.7% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in the average purchase cost of vehicles sold relative to the increase in average retail sales price, along with higher repair costs. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2016 was $10,361, a $681 increase over the prior fiscal year. As purchase costs increase, the margin between the purchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles we sell narrows as a percentage because the Company must offer affordable prices to our customers. The increased purchase costs are the result of a combination of consumer demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale, which remains high relative to supply, and a strategic management decision to purchase higher quality vehicles for our customers. The high demand and tight supply of the vehicles we purchase for resale are largely related to excess funding to the used vehicle financing market and the depressed levels of new car sales during and after the recession, although more robust new car sales in recent years have begun to bolster the supply of used vehicles. Finally, increases in the volume of wholesales sales, resulting from higher credit losses, also increase our cost of sales and thus negatively affect our gross margin percentages. We will continue to focus efforts on minimizing the average retail sales price of our vehicles in order to help keep contract terms shorter, which helps customers to maintain appropriate equity in their vehicles and reduces credit losses and resulting wholesale volumes.\n 24 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5% to 18.2% in fiscal 2016 from 17.7% in fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.4 million from fiscal 2015, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 28.5% (27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the second quarter) for fiscal 2016 compared to 25.5% for fiscal 2015. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to 31.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 27.8% for the prior year. Continuing macro-economic challenges and competitive conditions continue to put pressure on our customers and the resulting collections of our finance receivables, although the lower gas prices during fiscal 2016 have provided some relief to our customers. The Company has implemented several operational initiatives (including credit reporting and the use of GPS units on vehicles) to improve collections and continually pushes for improvements and better execution of its collection practices. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of credit loss experience and that the negative impact on credit losses in both the current and prior year periods resulting from negative macro-economic and competitive pressures has been somewhat mitigated by the improvements in oversight and accountability provided by the Company's investments in our corporate infrastructure within the collections area.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 0.7% compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2015, due to higher average borrowings during the fiscal year 2016 ($109.0 million compared to $102.2 million in the prior year).\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues increased $41.1 million, or 8.4%, in fiscal 2015, as compared to revenue growth of 5.3% in fiscal 2014, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in both fiscal years ($13.7 million), (ii) revenue growth from dealerships opened during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014 ($20.4 million), and (iii) revenue from dealerships opened after April 30, 2014 ($7.0 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2015 is attributable to (i) a 9.9% increase in retail unit volumes, and (ii) a 5.6% increase in interest and other income.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, remained flat at 57.7% in fiscal 2015 from 57.8% in fiscal 2014. The average retail sales price for fiscal 2015 was $9,680, an $88 decrease over the prior fiscal year. Average selling prices and top line sales levels in relation to wholesale volumes, resulting from credit loss experience, can have a significant effect on gross margin percentages.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased 0.4% to 17.7% in fiscal 2015 from 18.1% in fiscal 2014. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million from fiscal 2014, which consisted primarily of increased payroll costs, incremental costs related to new dealerships and higher infrastructure costs to support our growth, primarily in technology and compliance.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 27.4% (25.7% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the third quarter) for fiscal 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 27.8% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% for the prior year. The decrease primarily resulted from a lower frequency of losses, partially offset by an increase in the severity of losses. The higher severity of losses primarily resulted from lower wholesale values at time of repossession.\n 25 \nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 0.6% compared 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Lower average borrowings during the fiscal year 2015 ($102.2 million compared to $103.0 million in the prior year) were partially offset by higher interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the Company at April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Assets: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finance receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,299 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Inventory </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Property and equipment, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts payable and accrued liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes payable (receivable), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(894 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(645 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>782 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred income tax liabilities, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facilities and notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows receivables growth compared to revenue growth during each of the past three fiscal years. For fiscal year 2016, revenue growth exceeded growth in net finance receivables primarily due to higher charge-offs and the resulting increase in wholesale sales, which weighed on finance receivables growth, while higher interest income augmented growth in revenue. The Company currently anticipates going forward that the growth in finance receivables will generally be slightly higher than overall revenue growth on an annual basis due to overall term length increases partially offset by improvements in underwriting and collection procedures in an effort to reduce credit losses. The average term for installment sales contracts at April 30, 2016 was 31.6 months compared to 30.2 months at April 30, 2015.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Growth in finance receivables, net of deferred revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, inventory decreased 12.8% ($4.4 million). The decrease resulted primarily from a concerted company-wide effort to retain only the best quality vehicles. The Company will continue to manage inventory levels in the future to ensure adequate supply of vehicles, in volume and mix, and to meet sales demand.\n 26 \nProperty and equipment, net, increased by approximately $792,000 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The Company incurred $4.5 million in expenditures related to new dealerships as well as to refurbish and expand a number of existing locations, offset by depreciation expense.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased approximately $172,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to decreased payables related to decreased inventory levels as well as the amount and timing of cash overdrafts.\nIncome taxes receivable, net, increased approximately $249,000 at April 30, 2016 compared to April 30, 2015 primarily due to the timing of income tax payments and refunds.\nDeferred revenue increased $2.1 million in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015, primarily resulting from the longer term on the payment protection product due to increased contract terms, as well as the increase in the term and pricing of the service contract product.\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net, decreased approximately $898,000 at April 30, 2016 as compared to April 30, 2015 due primarily to the change in finance receivables and the book/tax difference on stock based compensation.\nBorrowings on the Company's revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily based upon a number of factors including (i) net income, (ii) finance receivables changes, (iii) income taxes, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) common stock repurchases. Historically, income from continuing operations, as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, have funded the Company's finance receivables growth, capital asset purchases and common stock repurchases. In fiscal 2016 the Company had a $4.7 million net increase in total revolving debt used to contribute to the funding of finance receivables growth of $19.9 million, net capital expenditures of $4.5 million and common stock repurchases of $14.2 million.\n 27 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's Statements of

percentages on vehicle sales, and (iv) credit losses, a significant portion of which relates to the collection of principal on finance receivables. The Company generates cash flow from income from operations. Historically, most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases. To the extent finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases exceed income from operations the Company generally increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. The majority of the Company's growth has been self-funded.\nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily as a result of (i) a higher non-cash charge for credit losses and (ii) higher finance receivable collections, partially offset by (iii) lower net income and (iv) an increase in finance receivables originations. Finance receivables, net, increased by $19.9 million during fiscal 2016.\n 28 \nCash flows from operations in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were positively impacted by (i) higher net income, (ii) an increase in deferred income taxes, (iii) higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, (iv) higher non-cash charges including credit losses, depreciation, and losses on claims for payment protection plan, partially offset by (v) an increase in finance receivables, net and (vi) an increase in inventory. Finance receivables, net, increased by $30.8 million during fiscal 2015.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for a vehicle has a significant effect on liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost for the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company's customers have limited incomes and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. Several external factors can negatively affect the purchase cost of vehicles. Decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, lead to decreased supply in the used car market. Also, constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can increase overall demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale as used vehicles become more attractive than new vehicles in times of economic instability. A negative shift in used vehicle supply, combined with strong demand, results in increased used vehicle prices and thus higher purchase costs for the Company.\nNew vehicle sales decreased dramatically beginning with the economic recession of 2008. While sales levels for new vehicles have risen steadily since 2009, new vehicle sales volumes only returned to pre-recession levels during fiscal 2016. In addition, the challenging macro-economic environment, together with the constriction in consumer credit starting in 2008, contributed to increased demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases and a resulting increase in used car prices. These negative macro-economic conditions have continued to affect our customers in the years since the recession and, in turn, have helped keep demand high for the types of vehicles we purchase. This increased demand, coupled with depressed levels of new vehicle sales in recent years, negatively impacted both the quality and the quantity of the used vehicle supply available to the Company. Management expects the tight supply of vehicles and resulting increases in vehicle purchase costs to continue, although some relief is expected as a result of steady increases in new car sales levels in recent periods.\nThe Company has devoted significant efforts to improving its purchasing processes to ensure adequate supply at appropriate prices, including expanding its purchasing territories to larger cities in close proximity to its dealerships and increasing its efforts to purchase vehicles from individuals at the dealership level as well as via the internet. The Company has also increased the level of accountability for its purchasing agents including the establishment of sourcing and pricing guidelines. Even with these efforts, the Company expects gross margin percentages to remain under pressure over the near term.\nThe Company believes that the amount of credit available for the sub-prime auto industry has increased in recent years and management expects the availability of consumer credit within the automotive industry to be higher over the near term when compared to historical levels. This is expected to contribute to continued strong overall demand for most, if not all, of the vehicles the Company purchases for resale. Increased competition resulting from availability of funding to the sub-prime auto industry has contributed to lower down payments and longer terms, which have had a negative effect on collection percentages, liquidity and credit losses when compared to prior periods.\nMacro-economic factors can have an effect on credit losses and resulting liquidity. General inflation, particularly within staple items such as groceries, as well as overall unemployment levels can have a significant effect on collection results and ultimately credit losses. The Company has made improvements to its business processes within the last few years to strengthen controls and provide stronger infrastructure to support its collections efforts. The Company anticipates that credit losses in the near term will be higher than historical ranges due to significant continued macro-economic challenges for the Company's customer base as well as increased competitive pressures. Management continues to focus on improved execution at the dealership level, specifically as related to working individually with customers concerning collection issues.\n 29 \nThe Company has generally leased the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located. As of April 30, 2016, the Company leased approximately 85% of its dealership properties. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located.\nThe Company's revolving credit facilities generally restrict distributions by the Company to its shareholders. The distribution limitations under the Credit Facilities allow the Company to repurchase the Company's stock so long as: either (a) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed $40 million beginning October 8, 2014 and the sum of borrowing bases combined minus the principal balances of all revolver loans after giving effect to such repurchases is equal to or greater than 30% of the sum of the borrowing bases, or (b) the aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed 75% of the consolidated net income of the Company measured on a trailing twelve month basis; provided that immediately before and after giving effect to the stock repurchases, at least 12.5% of the aggregate funds committed under the credit facilities remain available. Thus, although the Company currently does routinely repurchase stock, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company's lenders.\nAt April 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $602,000 of cash on hand and $61 million of availability under its revolving credit facilities (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). On a short-term basis, the Company's principal sources of liquidity include income from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. On a longer-term basis, the Company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from operations and borrowings under revolving credit facilities or fixed interest term loans. The Company's revolving credit facilities mature in October 2017 and the Company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facilities on or before the date they mature. Furthermore, while the Company has no specific plans to issue debt or equity securities, the Company believes, if necessary, it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities.\nThe Company expects to use cash from operations and borrowings to (i) grow its finance receivables portfolio, (ii) purchase property and equipment of approximately $2.2 million in the next 12 months in connection with refurbishing existing dealerships and adding new dealerships, subject to strong operating results, (iii) repurchase shares of common stock when favorable conditions exist and (iv) reduce debt to the extent excess cash is available.\nThe Company believes it will have adequate liquidity to continue to grow its revenues and to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nThe following is a summary of the Company's contractual payment obligations as of April 30, 2016, including renewal periods under operating leases that are reasonably assured (in thousands):\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving lines of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notes payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,621 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above excludes estimated interest payments on the Company's revolving lines of credit. The $46.7 million of operating lease commitments includes $16.2 million of non-cancelable lease commitments under the lease terms, and $30.5 million of lease commitments for renewal periods at the Company's option that are reasonably assured.\n 30 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for approximately 85% of its dealership and office facilities. Generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options. The Company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its dealership locations and to preserve capital. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of its dealership and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past. For the years ended April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately $6.1 million, $5.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company has a standby letter of credit relating to an insurance policy totaling $1 million at April 30, 2016.\nOther than its operating leases and the letter of credit, the Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRelated Finance Company Contingency\nCar-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns. Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price. These types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection for the Company's finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of Colonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company's overall effective state income tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. The actual interpretation of the Regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the Regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company's overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments.\nThe Company's policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of April 30, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company's estimates. The Company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses, which is discussed below. The Company's accounting policies are discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n 31 \nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date in the collection of its finance receivables currently outstanding. At April 30, 2016, the weighted average total contract term was 31.6 months with 23.2 months remaining. The reserve amount in the allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2016, $102.5 million, was 25.0% of the principal balance in finance receivables of $437.3 million, less unearned payment protection plan revenue of $17.3 million and unearned service contract revenue of $10.0 million.\nThe estimated reserve amount is the Company's anticipated future net charge-offs for losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The allowance takes into account historical credit loss experience (both timing and severity of losses), with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in contract characteristics (i.e., average amount financed, months outstanding at loss date, term and age of portfolio), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by management with any changes reflected in current operations. The calculation of the allowance for credit losses uses the following primary factors:\n \u00b7 The number of units repossessed or charged-off as a percentage of total units financed over specific historical periods of time from one year to five years. \n \u00b7 The average net repossession and charge-off loss per unit during the last eighteen months, segregated by the number of months since the contract origination date, and adjusted for the expected future average net charge-off loss per unit. Approximately 50% of the charge-offs that will ultimately occur in the portfolio are expected to occur within 10-11 months following the balance sheet date. The average age of an account at charge-off date is 11.7 months. \n \u00b7 The timing of repossession and charge-off losses relative to the date of sale (i.e., how long it takes for a repossession or charge-off to occur) for repossessions and charge-offs occurring during the last eighteen months. \nA point estimate is produced by this analysis which is then supplemented by any positive or negative subjective factors to arrive at an overall reserve amount that management considers to be a reasonable estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be realized via actual charge-offs in the future. Although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen which could cause actual credit losses to be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses, the Company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and has made reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses. While challenging economic conditions can negatively impact credit losses, the effectiveness of the execution of internal policies and procedures within the collections area and the competitive environment on the funding side have historically had a more significant effect on collection results than macro-economic issues. A 1% change, as a percentage of Finance receivables, in the allowance for credit losses would equate to an approximate pre-tax change of $4.1 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOccasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies which the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes the impact of recently issued standards which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nDebt Issuance Costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. This accounting standard was implemented by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result of the application of this accounting standard, the Company has provided additional disclosures in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n 32 \nRevenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance in ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the"}
