Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report may include forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is subject to the safe harbor created by that act. The safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act will not apply to certain forward looking statements\u201d because we issued penny stock\u201d (as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3(a)(51-1) under the Exchange Act) during the three year period preceding the date(s) on which those forward looking statements were first made, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers that certain important factors may affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements which may be deemed to have been made in this Report or which are otherwise made by or on our behalf.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.\nIndex\nCritical Accounting Policy and Estimates\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of these financial statements included in this report requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n(a) Warrants:\nThe following table illustrates

Actual losses on accounts receivable were $18,759 for 2016 and $9,358 for 2015. The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nIndex\nOn May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation ( Artisan\u201d), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska. The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones were met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met.\nPursuant to an asset purchase agreement, effective November 2, 2012, the Company purchased the outstanding assets of The Haley Group, LLC ( Haley\u201d). Pursuant to a purchase agreement, effective June 30, 2014, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d). Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which vary from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consist of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $4,524,007 or approximately 14.8% to $35,172,388 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $30,648,381 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement that strategy if, based on our analysis, we deem it beneficial to us.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIndex\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such segments may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $24,502,264, an increase of $3,041,452 or approximately 14.2% compared to cost of goods sold of $21,460,812 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $17,561,513; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $6,940,750. Total gross margin was approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016 compared to approximately 30.0% of sales in 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2015 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2016, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold will remain stable.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $1,620,324 or approximately 18.0% to $7,370,334 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,990,658 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in non-cash compensation, which was $ 1,076,147 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1,351,084 or 55.7% compared to non-cash compensation of $ 2,427,231 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $92,529 or approximately 16.1% to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $575,914 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Approximately 24.7% or $119,495 of the interest expense was accrued or paid interest on the company's commercial loans and notes payable; approximately 76.6% or $370,036 of the interest was a non-cash GAAP accounting charge associated with the amortization of the discounts on the Company's notes payable. The Company also had $6,146 of interest income during the period.\nOther Income\nThere was no other income during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to other income of $5,400 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Other income in 2015 consisted of a gain on the sale of one of the investments that the Company made into an early stage food business. That business was subsequently acquired by a private equity fund in 2015.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $2,816,405 which is an increase of approximately 853.8% compared to a net loss of $373,603 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a total of $3,300,869 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $299,825, depreciation expense of $84,626, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,427,231, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $489,187.\nIndex\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $6,172,874, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $3,764,053; trade accounts receivable, net of $1,538,395; inventory of $815,033; and other current assets of $55,393. Also at December 31, 2016, the Company had current liabilities of $5,400,488 consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3,119,533, , including $65,000 to related parties; accrued interest of $626,873; current portion of notes payable - related party of $164,650; and current portion of notes payable of $1,424,432, net of discount of $185,020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,469,096. This consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $6,387,705 offset by the gain on sale of investment of $7,201,196, non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,108,055 (of which $1,028,908 was related to TFD employees), amortization of discount on notes payable of $370,036, depreciation and amortization of $497,920, and decrease in allowance for bad debt of ($10,350). The Company's cash position also increased by $1,492,890 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $488,452 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of $470,482 cash disposed in the sale of TFD; $10,512 for the acquisition of property and equipment; and $7,458 for investments in food related companies. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,353,880 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of borrowings on revolving credit facilities of $805,959, offset by payments made on revolving credit facilities of $941,831; principal payments on notes payable of $1,191,627, principal payments on capital leases of $11,531, and payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $14,850.\nThe Company had net working capital of $772,386 as of December 31, 2016. We generated cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $3,469,096, compared to cash used in operating activities of $3,662,434 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 11 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 2.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not made any adjustments to the financial statements which would be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.\n2017 Plans\nDuring 2017, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nIndex\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2017.\nIndex\nITEM 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nBonita Springs, Florida\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries ( the Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its Internal Control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n/s/ LIGGETT & WEBB, P.A.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 30, 2017\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

DECEMBER 31, 2016 and 2015\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Activity\nOur business is currently conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, Food New Media Group, Inc. ( FNM\u201d), Organic Food Brokers ( OFB\u201d) , Gourmet Food Service Group, Inc. ( GFG\u201d), Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., The Haley Group, Inc. ( Haley\u201d), Oasis Sales Corp ( Oasis\u201d) , 4 The Gourmet, Inc. (d/b/a For The Gourmet, Inc.), ( Gourmet\u201d and collectively with IVFH and its other subsidiaries, the Company\u201d or IVFH\u201d). Overall, our focus is on distribution or the enabling of distribution of specialty food products ranging from specialty foodservice products to Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG\u201d) products Since its incorporation, the Company primarily through FII's relationship with thousands of specialty foodservice products including US Foods, Inc.

Gourmet has been in the business of providing specialty food e-commerce consumers, through its own website at www.forthegourmet.com and though www.amazon.com, with unique specialty gourmet food products shipped directly from our network of vendors and from our warehouses within 24 - 72 hours. GFG is focused on expanding the Company's program offerings to additional customers. In our business model, we receive orders from our customers and then work closely with our suppliers and our warehouse facilities to have the orders fulfilled. In order to maintain freshness and quality, we carefully select our suppliers based upon, among other factors, their quality, uniqueness, reliability and access to overnight courier services.\nArtisan is a supplier of over 1,500 niche gourmet products to over 500 customers in the Greater Chicago area. Haley provides consulting services and other solutions to its clients in the food industry. Haley is a dedicated foodservice consulting and advisory firm that works closely with companies to access private label and manufacturers' label food service opportunities with the intent of helping them launch and commercialize new products in the broadline foodservice industry and get products distributed via national broadline food distributors. OFB and Oasis are outsourced national sales and brand management teams for emerging organic and specialty food Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG\u201d) companies and provides emerging CPG specialty food brands distribution and shelf placement access in all of the major metro markets in the food retail industry.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn February 23, 2016, the Company consummated the sale of 90% of our ownership in FD. As a result of the sale, the results of operations for all periods have been included in Net (loss) from discontinued operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, these assets and liabilities have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, FNM, OFB, GFG, Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., Haley, and Gourmet. All accounts of FD have been included under discontinued operations. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.\nIndex\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped either same day or overnight or through longer shipping terms to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers, if any, are included in revenues.\nFor revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB\u201d Accounting Standards Codification ASC\u201d 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.\nCost of goods sold\nWe have included in cost of goods sold all costs which are directly related to the generation of revenue. These costs include primarily the cost of food and raw materials, packing and handling, shipping, and delivery costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nWe have included in selling, general, and administrative expenses all other costs which support the Company's operations but which are not includable as a cost of sales. These include primarily payroll, facility costs such as rent and utilities, selling expenses such as commissions and advertising, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and other administrative costs including professional fees and costs associated with non-cash stock compensation. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less which are not securing any corporate obligations.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $8,123 and $56,364 at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are valued at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives up to five years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe estimated service lives of property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> Computer Equipment\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warehouse Equipment\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office Furniture and Fixtures\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vehicles\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nInventories\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and is determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, line of credit, accounts payable and accrued expenses, none of which is held for trading, approximates their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements\u201d (SFAS 157), which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an impairment in the value of goodwill associated with FD in the amount of $16,614,373. This amount is recorded in the net loss from discontinued operations on the Company's statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nComprehensive Income\nASC 220-10-15 Reporting Comprehensive Income,\u201d establishes standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220-10-15 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not have any items of comprehensive income in any of the periods presented.\nCost Method Investments\nThe Company has made several investments in early stage private food related companies and are accounting for these investments under the cost method.\nIndex\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.\nA net loss causes all outstanding stock options and warrants to be antidilutive. As a result, the basic and dilutive losses per common share are the same for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2016:\nConvertible notes and interest:\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $812,215 with accrued interest of $626,873 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 5,756,352 shares of common stock.\nWarrants:\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants for holders to purchase the following additional shares: 2,294,493 shares at a price of $0.575 per share; 448,010 shares at a price of $0.55 per share; 94,783 shares at a price of $0.25 per share; and 700,000 shares at a price of $0.01 per share.\nStock Options:\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding options for holders to purchase the following additional shares: 30,000 shares at a price of $3.40 per share; 20,000 shares at a price of $2.40 per share; 500,000 shares at a price of $2.00 per share; 15,000 shares at a price of $1.90 per share; 310,000 shares at a price of $1.60 per share; 100,000 shares at a price of $1.46 per share; 75,000 shares at a price of $1.31 per share; 225,000 shares at a price of $0.57 per share; and 1,170,000 shares at a price of $0.35 per share.\nRSUs:\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) for the potential issuance of shares of the Company's common stock for the purpose of aligning executives and employees of the Company and for the purpose of compensation for serving as members of the Board of Directors of the Company and for the purposes of retaining qualified personnel at compensation levels that otherwise would not be available should the company have been required to pay certain salaries in cash only. Certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the employees of the Company ( Employee RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs\u201d); and certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of FD ( FD RSUs\u201d).\nAt December 31, 2016, the following Executive RSUs were outstanding: A total of 1,737,072 RSUs were vested, and 800,000 will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 125,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. The Company estimated that the stock-price goals of the Company's stock price closing above $2.00 per share for 20 straight days have a 90% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 90% of their face value; the Company also estimated that the likelihood of the Company's stock closing above $3.00 per share for 20 straight days is 70%, and these RSUs were valued at 70% of their face value. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nOn March 31, 2016, 10,000 Board RSUs were issued. On August 3, 2016, 95,000 Board RSUs were exercised by a former Board member. At December 31, 2016, the following Board RSUs were outstanding: a total of 545,000 RSUs were vested, and 270,000will vest on July 1, 2017.\nThe Employee RSUs were issued to certain nonexecutive employees of the Company either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. On March 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were issued. At December 31, 2016, 180,534 Employee RSUs were outstanding, all of which were vested.\nIndex\nOn January 26, 2016, 300,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and 800,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On April 25, 2016, an additional 1,000,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. On June 29, 2016, 200,000 FD RSUs were exercised, and an additional 900,000 FD RSUs were forfeited. At December 31, 2016, 1,000,000 FD RSUs were outstanding; 600,000 were vested, and 400,000 were scheduled to vest on July 1, 2017.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense for RSUs in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the grant. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $1,663,309 (including $813,908 charged to discontinued operations) and $4,206,282 (including $2,258,216 charged to discontinued operations) related to recognition of RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDilutive shares at December 31, 2015:\nConvertible notes and interest:\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding convertible notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $758,065 with accrued interest of $668,615 convertible at the rate of $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 5,706,720 shares of common stock, and a convertible note payable in the amount of $100,000 convertible at the rate of $1.54 into 64,935 shares of common stock.\nWarrants:\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding warrants for holders to purchase the following additional shares: 2,294,493 shares at a price of $0.575 per share; 448,010 shares at a price of $0.55 per share; 94,783 shares at a price of $0.25 per share; and 700,000 shares at a price of $0.01 per share.\nStock Options:\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding options for holders to purchase the following additional shares: 30,000 shares at a price of $3.40 per share; 20,000 shares at a price of $2.40 per share; 500,000 shares at a price of $2.00 per share; 15,000 shares at a price of $1.90 per share; 310,000 shares at a price of $1.60 per share; 100,000 shares at a price of $1.46 per share; 15,000 shares at a price of $1.44 per share; 75,000 shares at a price of $1.31 per share; 225,000 shares at a price of $0.57 per share; 92,500 shares at a price of $0.48 per share; 92,500 shares at a price of $0.474 per share; 92,500 shares at a price of $0.45 per share; 275,000 shares at a price of $0.40 per share; 92,500 shares at a price of $0.38 per share; and 1,170,000 shares at a price of $0.35 per share.\nRSUs:\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) for the potential issuance of shares of the Company's common stock for the purpose of aligning executives and employees of the Company and for the purpose of compensation for serving as members of the Board of Directors of the Company and for the purposes of retaining qualified personnel at compensation levels that otherwise would not be available should the company have been required to pay certain salaries in cash only. Certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of FD ( FD RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs\u201d); certain RSUs were issued to the employees of the Company ( Employee RSUs\u201d); and certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs\u201d). On January 1, 2015, the Company issued 70,640 RSUs to employees as a bonus; these RSUs were accrued during the year ended December 31, 2014. These RSUs vested immediately. Also on January 1, 2015, the Company issued a total of 350,000 RSUs to its executive officers. These RSUs were for services provided during the year ended December 31, 2014, and were accrued during the year ended December 31, 2014. On November 2, 2015, 125,000 RSUs were exercised by the Company's CEO. At December 31, 2015, the following Executive RSUs were outstanding: A total of 797,466 RSUs were vested; 75,000 RSUs will vest on May 1, 2016; 600,000 RSUs will vest on December 31, 2016; and 800,000 will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 125,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $2.00 per share for 20 straight trading days, and an additional 175,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the attainment of a stock price of $3.00 per share for 20 straight trading days. The Company estimated that the stock-price goals of the Company's stock price closing above $2.00 per share for 20 straight days have a 90% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 90% of their face value; the Company also estimated that the likelihood of the Company's stock closing above $3.00 per share for 20 straight days is 70%, and these RSUs were valued at 70% of their face value. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs.\nAt December 31, 2015, the following Board RSUs were outstanding: a total of 360,000 RSUs were vested; 360,000 RSUs vest on July 1, 2016; and 360,000 RSUs vest on July 1, 2017. In June 2015, Sol Mayer resigned from the Company's board, and 180,000 unvested RSUs were forfeited by Mr. Mayer.\nThe Employee RSUs were issued to certain nonexecutive employees of the Company either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. At December 31, 2015, the following Employee RSUs were outstanding: a total of 70,640 RSUs were vested.\nIndex\nThe FD RSUs issued to certain nonexecutive employees of FD were issued either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses or a combination of both bonus and salary. At December 31, 2015, the following FD were outstanding: a total of 1,200,000 RSUs were vested; 900,000 RSUs will vest on December 31, 2016; and 1,200,000 RSUs will vest on July 1, 2017. An additional 350,000 RSUs will vest contingent upon the Company's stock price closing at or above $2.50 per share for 20 consecutive trading days.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash and temporary cash in investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of applicable government mandated insurance limit. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, trade receivables from the Company's largest customer amount to 44% and 60%, respectively, of total trade receivables.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We used the Company's historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility. The risk-free rate assumption was based on United States Treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the expected term of the stock option. The expected dividend assumption was based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) were measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted. Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options and RSUs are based on the Company's historical forfeiture experience. The estimated fair value of stock options and RSUs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting term of the grant. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest. Management assesses the probability of the performance milestones being met on a continuous basis.\nOptions expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Option expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,752\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 195,385\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRSUs expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the table below:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 849,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,948,066\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs expense - Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 813,908\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,258,216\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,663,309\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,206,282\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period data to the current presentation.\nIndex\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, which creates ASC Topic 842, Leases.\u201d This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-9, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d This amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends ASC Topic 230, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The amendments in this Update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update outlines the classification of specific transactions as either cash inflows or outflows from financing activities, operating activities, investing activities or non-cash activities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nManagement reviewed currently issued pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2016, and does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.\n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nEffective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( FD\u201d) to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company accrued the amount of $850,000 representing the amount due based on an agreement signed in 2017. The agreement involved the purchase of rights to 1,450,000 RSUs and the purchase of 642,688 shares of the Company's common stock (see note 18).\nASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on February 9, 2016. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of FD, excluding corporate services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss and the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nIndex\nThe following information presents the major classes of line

As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair value of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. The analysis completed in 2016 and 2015 determined that there was no impairment to goodwill assets related to the Artisan and Haley transactions.\nIndex\n8.

INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes result from the temporary differences primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets and debt discount and an accumulation of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes with a valuation allowance against the carryforwards for book purposes.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in deferred tax assets are Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.2 million, which will expire through 2036. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to significant changes in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable statutory income tax rate of 39.6% for the December 31, 2016 and 2015 to the loss before taxes as a result of the following differences:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,816,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (373,603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total tax at statutory rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,115,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (148,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Temporary differences\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 235,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37,500\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences - restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,070,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent difference - meals and entertainment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences- non cash compensation, derivatives and discount amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 463,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,155,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,252,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,054,500\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,252,500\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,054,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations.\nDeferred income taxes include the net tax effects of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Prior to the acquisition of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc. David Vohaska was the owner of Artisan. The Company and Mr. Vohaska agreed to terminate this lease agreement effective October 11, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, there were no commitments for minimum rental payments.\n16. MAJOR CUSTOMER\nThe Company's largest customer, U.S. Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% and 72% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the contract is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2017.\nIndex\n17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nOur short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable and other liabilities, consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management's estimates, reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of the Company's stock option, convertible debt features and warrant instruments is determined using option pricing models.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 815-40, the Company is required to disclose the fair value measurements required by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The other liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these liabilities are as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> Level 1 -\n</td> <td> Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 2 -\n</td> <td> Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 3 -\n</td> <td> Unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data exist, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have financial assets or liabilities that are required to be accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\n18.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 31, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and our disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).\nSubject to the inherent limitations described in the following paragraph, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level.\nInherent Limitations Over Internal Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nIndex\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 9B.

The employment agreements provide for salaries and benefits, including stock grants and extend up to five years. In addition to salary and benefit provisions, the agreements include defined commitments should the employer terminate the employee with or without cause.\nSAM KLEPFISH\nOn November 20, 2012 we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Klepfish, the Corporation's CEO, having an effective date of January 1, 2013 and terminating on December 31, 2015. The agreement provides a base compensation in the amount of $198,312 in cash plus an additional $27,937 in restricted stock units for year one, $223,987 in cash plus an additional $24,875 in restricted stock units for year two, and $260,075 in cash plus an additional $13,688 in restricted stock units for year three. The agreement also provides for annual bonuses including bonuses based on increases in EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of our various subsidiaries; additional bonuses upon the occurrence of certain events such as: listing on specific stock exchanges, spin-offs, investments and stock trading and volume levels. The agreement also provides for stock options with exercise prices ranging from $0.40 - $1.60 and an award of restricted stock, which only vests if certain volume and pricing milestones with respect to our common stock are met. Mr. Klepfish also has the option of receiving any portion of his salary or bonus in the form of equity. The agreement also contains non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.\nOn August 7, 2014, our board of directors approved the amendment of the Employment Agreement with Mr. Klepfish effective as of August 13, 2014. The employment agreement was amended as follows: (i) it has been extended by one year to December 31, 2016; (ii) it provides for 10% annual increases of Base Salary commencing in 2014; (iii) certain performance based bonuses in the employment agreement are eliminated; (iv) stock grants previously issued with vesting based upon performance or stock price are cancelled; (v) a new performance based bonus structure to partially replace the previous structure, based upon meeting certain Cash EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and non-cash compensation charges) targets, the new bonus will have a cash portion and a stock portion and all Base Salary can be paid in cash or in stock at the option of Mr. Klepfish, and (vi) 125,00 restricted stock units which vest if the 30 day average closing price of our common stock is $2.00 or above and there is a 50,000 average daily volume or there is a 50,000 average daily volume for 14 straight trading days; and 175,000 restricted stock units which vest if the 30 day average closing price of our common stock is $3.00 or above and there is a 50,000 average daily volume for 14 straight trading days. Mr. Klepfish will have the option, on an annual basis, to take all or part of the cash portion of the bonus, or any part of Base Salary in the form of stock at a valuation based upon the closing stock price on the last trading day of the prior year. The decision on how much, if any, of the bonus to take in stock must be made by May 1 of each year, unless earlier required. The Cash EBITDA target levels do not include the effect of any potential future acquisitions and also do not include certain one time or non-recurring expenses in the calculation of the Cash EBITDA. If a Cash EBITDA target is missed by 3% or less, the bonus for the target so missed shall be reduced by 20% and if it is missed by 3.1% -5%, the bonus for such target shall be reduced by 30%, except in both cases, Mr. Klepfish has negative discretion to further reduce the bonuses or even cancel them. In March 2016, Mr. Klepfish's employment agreement was extended for another year under the same terms.\nIndex\nIn November 2014, the employment agreement of Mr. Klepfish was amended (i) ) in the event of a change of control (as defined below) all equity based compensation (including options and restricted stock units) payable pursuant to such employment agreements, shall immediately vest and/or restrictions thereon shall lapse, and (ii) to provide that in the event of a termination without Cause (as defined in the employment agreement) they shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the greater of (x) the salary payable over the last six months of the term of the agreement, or (y) the Base Salary (as defined in the employment agreement) remaining through the end of the then-current term of the agreement. The definition of change of control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (w) the sale or transfer by the Company for at least $25 million (such consideration consisting of cash, cash equivalents, notes or securities) of more than 50% of its Voting Securities (as defined below) or substantially all of its assets; or (x) the acquisition, other than from the Company or employees of it or any of its subsidiaries, by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (other than an employee benefit plan of the Company) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the Voting Securities\u201d); or (y) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or recapitalization of the Company (a Business Combination\u201d), other than a Business Combination in which more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding Voting Securities of the surviving or resulting entity immediately following the Business Combination is held by the persons who, immediately prior to the Business Combination, were the holders of the Voting Securities; or (z) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nMr. Klepfish was awarded, as a special bonus, effective November 17, 2014, an aggregate of 1,000,000 restricted stock units ( RSU\u201d) subject to time and performance vesting conditions, with the timing conditions as follows: 150,000 RSUs vest on each of July 1 and December 31, 2015; 300,000 RSUs vest on December 31, 2016 and 400,000 RSUs vest on July 1, 2017, and the performance conditions are as follows: for the RSUs vesting in 2015, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2015, for the RSUs vesting in 2016, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2016 and for the RSUs vesting in 2017, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2017, provided however, that if the performance condition is not met in any year, the RSUs scheduled to vest in such year will still vest if the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, has six months with sales of at least $2,500,000 during the following year. The company's board of directors will modify and increase the performance requirements, with the consent of executive, if warranted and appropriate.\nEffective March 29, 2017, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Klepfish.

The Cash EBITDA target levels do not include the effect of any potential future acquisitions and also do not include certain one time or non-recurring expenses in the calculation of the Cash EBITDA. If a Cash EBITDA target is missed by 3% or less, the bonus for the target so missed shall be reduced by 20% and if it is missed by 3.1% -5%, the bonus for such target shall be reduced by 30%. In March 2016, Mr. Wiernasz's employment agreement was extended for another year under the same terms.\nIndex\nThe employment agreement of Mr. Wiernasz was amended (i) ) in the event of a change of control (as defined below) all equity based compensation (including options and restricted stock units) payable pursuant to such employment agreements, shall immediately vest and/or restrictions thereon shall lapse, and (ii) to provide that in the event of a termination without Cause (as defined in the employment agreement) they shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the greater of (x) the salary payable over the last six months of the term of the agreement, or (y) the Base Salary (as defined in the employment agreement) remaining through the end of the then-current term of the agreement. The definition of change of control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (w) the sale or transfer by the Company for at least $25 million (such consideration consisting of cash, cash equivalents, notes or securities) of more than 50% of its Voting Securities (as defined below) or substantially all of its assets; or (x) the acquisition, other than from the Company or employees of it or any of its subsidiaries, by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (other than an employee benefit plan of the Company) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the Voting Securities\u201d); or (y) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or recapitalization of the Company (a Business Combination\u201d), other than a Business Combination in which more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding Voting Securities of the surviving or resulting entity immediately following the Business Combination is held by the persons who, immediately prior to the Business Combination, were the holders of the Voting Securities; or (z) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.\nMr. Wiernasz was awarded, as a special bonus, effective November 17, 2014, an aggregate of 1,000,000 restricted stock units ( RSU\u201d) subject to time and performance vesting conditions, with the timing conditions as follows: 150,000 RSUs vest on each of July 1 and December 31, 2015; 300,000 RSUs vest on December 31, 2016 and 400,000 RSUs vest on July 1, 2017, and the performance conditions are as follows: for the RSUs vesting in 2015, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2015, for the RSUs vesting in 2016, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2016 and for the RSUs vesting in 2017, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, must have four months with sales above $2,500,000 during 2017, provided however, that if the performance condition is not met in any year, the RSUs scheduled to vest in such year will still vest if the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, has six months with sales of at least $2,500,000 during the following year. The company's board of directors will modify and increase the performance requirements, with the consent of executive, if warranted and appropriate.\nOn March 21, 2017, the board of directors approved a $65,000 cash bonus for Mr. Wiernasz with respect to his performance in 2016.\nEffective March 29, 2017, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Wiernasz.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report may include forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is subject to the safe harbor created by that act. The safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act will not apply to certain forward looking statements\u201d because we issued penny stock\u201d (as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3(a)(51-1) under the Exchange Act) during the three year period preceding the date(s) on which those forward looking statements were first made, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers that certain important factors may affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements which may be deemed to have been made in this Report or which are otherwise made by or on our behalf. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may\u201d, will\u201d, expect\u201d, believe\u201d, explore\u201d, consider\u201d, anticipate\u201d, intend\u201d, could\u201d, estimate\u201d, plan\u201d, or propose\u201d or the negative variations of those words or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties associated with:\n\n \u25cf Our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay our lenders and other creditors, \n\n \u25cf Our dependence on the efforts and abilities of our current employees and executive officers, \n \u25cf Changes in government regulations that are applicable to our current or anticipated business, \n \u25cf Changes in the demand for our products and services, \n \u25cf The degree and nature of our competition, \n \u25cf The lack of diversification of our business plan, \n \u25cf The general volatility of the capital markets and the establishment of a market for our shares, and \n \u25cf Disruption in the economic and financial conditions primarily from the impact of past terrorist attacks in the United States, threats of future attacks, police and military activities overseas and other disruptive worldwide political and economic events and environmental weather conditions. \nWe are also subject to other risks detailed from time to time in our other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere in this report. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.\nIndex\nCritical Accounting Policy and Estimates\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of these financial statements included in this report requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n(a) Warrants:\nThe following table illustrates certain key information regarding our warrants and warrant valuation assumptions at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n(b) Embedded conversion features of notes payable:\nThe following table illustrates certain key information regarding our Conversion options and conversion option valuation assumptions at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nIndex\n(c) Stock options:\nThe Company accounts for options in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40. Options are valued upon issuance utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model. Option expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the related option award. The following table illustrates certain key information regarding our options and option assumptions at December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nDoubtful Accounts Receivable\nThe Company maintained an allowance in the amount of $8,123 for doubtful accounts receivable at December 31, 2016, and $56,364 at December 31, 2015. Actual losses on accounts receivable were $18,759 for 2016 and $9,358 for 2015. The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nIndex\nOn May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation ( Artisan\u201d), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska. The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones were met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met.\nPursuant to an asset purchase agreement, effective November 2, 2012, the Company purchased the outstanding assets of The Haley Group, LLC ( Haley\u201d). Pursuant to a purchase agreement, effective June 30, 2014, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d). Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which vary from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consist of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $4,524,007 or approximately 14.8% to $35,172,388 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $30,648,381 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement that strategy if, based on our analysis, we deem it beneficial to us.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIndex\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such segments may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $24,502,264, an increase of $3,041,452 or approximately 14.2% compared to cost of goods sold of $21,460,812 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $17,561,513; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $6,940,750. Total gross margin was approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016 compared to approximately 30.0% of sales in 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2015 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2016, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold will remain stable.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $1,620,324 or approximately 18.0% to $7,370,334 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,990,658 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in non-cash compensation, which was $ 1,076,147 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1,351,084 or 55.7% compared to non-cash compensation of $ 2,427,231 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $92,529 or approximately 16.1% to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $575,914 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Approximately 24.7% or $119,495 of the interest expense was accrued or paid interest on the company's commercial loans and notes payable; approximately 76.6% or $370,036 of the interest was a non-cash GAAP accounting charge associated with the amortization of the discounts on the Company's notes payable. The Company also had $6,146 of interest income during the period.\nOther Income\nThere was no other income during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to other income of $5,400 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Other income in 2015 consisted of a gain on the sale of one of the investments that the Company made into an early stage food business. That business was subsequently acquired by a private equity fund in 2015.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $2,816,405 which is an increase of approximately 853.8% compared to a net loss of $373,603 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a total of $3,300,869 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $299,825, depreciation expense of $84,626, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,427,231, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $489,187.\nIndex\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $6,172,874, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $3,764,053; trade accounts receivable, net of $1,538,395; inventory of $815,033; and other current assets of $55,393. Also at December 31, 2016, the Company had current liabilities of $5,400,488 consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3,119,533, , including $65,000 to related parties; accrued interest of $626,873; current portion of notes payable - related party of $164,650; and current portion of notes payable of $1,424,432, net of discount of $185,020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,469,096. This consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $6,387,705 offset by the gain on sale of investment of $7,201,196, non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,108,055 (of which $1,028,908 was related to TFD employees), amortization of discount on notes payable of $370,036, depreciation and amortization of $497,920, and decrease in allowance for bad debt of ($10,350). The Company's cash position also increased by $1,492,890 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $488,452 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of $470,482 cash disposed in the sale of TFD; $10,512 for the acquisition of property and equipment; and $7,458 for investments in food related companies. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,353,880 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of borrowings on revolving credit facilities of $805,959, offset by payments made on revolving credit facilities of $941,831; principal payments on notes payable of $1,191,627, principal payments on capital leases of $11,531, and payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $14,850.\nThe Company had net working capital of $772,386 as of December 31, 2016. We generated cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $3,469,096, compared to cash used in operating activities of $3,662,434 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 11 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 2.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not made any adjustments to the financial statements which would be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.\n2017 Plans\nDuring 2017, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nIndex\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2017.\nIndex\nITEM 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nBonita Springs, Florida\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries ( the Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its Internal Control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n/s/ LIGGETT & WEBB, P.A.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 30, 2017\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n(a) Warrants:\nThe following table illustrates

Actual losses on accounts receivable were $18,759 for 2016 and $9,358 for 2015. The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The estimated fair values approximate their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates. These fair values have historically varied due to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of valuation. Generally, these liabilities increased as the price of the Company's stock increased (with resultant gain), and decreased as the Company's stock decreased (yielding a loss). In December 2012, the Company removed these liabilities from its balance sheet by reclassifying them as equity.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past.\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII\u201d or Food Innovations\u201d), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.\nIndex\nOn May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation ( Artisan\u201d), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska. The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones were met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met.\nPursuant to an asset purchase agreement, effective November 2, 2012, the Company purchased the outstanding assets of The Haley Group, LLC ( Haley\u201d). Pursuant to a purchase agreement, effective June 30, 2014, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB\u201d). Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C.\nOn August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the Fresh Diet Merger Agreement\u201d), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet\u201d or FD\u201d) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD's current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which vary from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consist of interest free loans from FD's former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.\nTransactions With a Major Customer\nTransactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) in Business - Relationship with U.S. Foods, and (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in FD in February 2016. Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted. See Note 2 - discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nThis discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $4,524,007 or approximately 14.8% to $35,172,388 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $30,648,381 in the prior year.\nWe continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products, private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement that strategy if, based on our analysis, we deem it beneficial to us.\nAny changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIndex\nCurrently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such segments may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.\nSee Transactions with Major Customers\u201d and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ( SEC\u201d) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $24,502,264, an increase of $3,041,452 or approximately 14.2% compared to cost of goods sold of $21,460,812 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $17,561,513; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $6,940,750. Total gross margin was approximately 30.3% of sales in 2016 compared to approximately 30.0% of sales in 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold is primary attributable to an increase in sales. The increase in gross margins from 2015 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.\nIn 2016, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share. We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold will remain stable.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $1,620,324 or approximately 18.0% to $7,370,334 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,990,658 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in non-cash compensation, which was $ 1,076,147 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1,351,084 or 55.7% compared to non-cash compensation of $ 2,427,231 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $92,529 or approximately 16.1% to $483,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $575,914 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Approximately 24.7% or $119,495 of the interest expense was accrued or paid interest on the company's commercial loans and notes payable; approximately 76.6% or $370,036 of the interest was a non-cash GAAP accounting charge associated with the amortization of the discounts on the Company's notes payable. The Company also had $6,146 of interest income during the period.\nOther Income\nThere was no other income during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to other income of $5,400 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Other income in 2015 consisted of a gain on the sale of one of the investments that the Company made into an early stage food business. That business was subsequently acquired by a private equity fund in 2015.\nNet income from continuing operations\nFor the reasons above, the Company had net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 of $2,816,405 which is an increase of approximately 853.8% compared to a net loss of $373,603 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a total of $1,837,094 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $232,768, depreciation expense of $158,143, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $1,076,147, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $370,036. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a total of $3,300,869 in non-cash charges, including amortization of intangible assets in the amount of $299,825, depreciation expense of $84,626, charges for non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,427,231, and amortization of the discount on notes payable in the amount of $489,187.\nIndex\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2016\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $6,172,874, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $3,764,053; trade accounts receivable, net of $1,538,395; inventory of $815,033; and other current assets of $55,393. Also at December 31, 2016, the Company had current liabilities of $5,400,488 consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3,119,533, , including $65,000 to related parties; accrued interest of $626,873; current portion of notes payable - related party of $164,650; and current portion of notes payable of $1,424,432, net of discount of $185,020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $3,469,096. This consisted of the Company's consolidated net income of $6,387,705 offset by the gain on sale of investment of $7,201,196, non-cash compensation in the amount of $2,108,055 (of which $1,028,908 was related to TFD employees), amortization of discount on notes payable of $370,036, depreciation and amortization of $497,920, and decrease in allowance for bad debt of ($10,350). The Company's cash position also increased by $1,492,890 as a result of changes in the components of current assets and current liabilities.\nThe Company had cash used in investing activities of $488,452 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of $470,482 cash disposed in the sale of TFD; $10,512 for the acquisition of property and equipment; and $7,458 for investments in food related companies. The Company had cash used in financing activities of $1,353,880 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of borrowings on revolving credit facilities of $805,959, offset by payments made on revolving credit facilities of $941,831; principal payments on notes payable of $1,191,627, principal payments on capital leases of $11,531, and payments made for the purchase of treasury stock of $14,850.\nThe Company had net working capital of $772,386 as of December 31, 2016. We generated cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $3,469,096, compared to cash used in operating activities of $3,662,434 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines. Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 11 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.\nIn February 2016, we completed the sale of FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD. See Note 2.\nIf the Company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to fully implement its business plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not made any adjustments to the financial statements which would be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.\n2017 Plans\nDuring 2017, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities and continuing to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the Company's existing sales channels and through a variety of additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.\nNo assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.\nIndex\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.\nTransactions with Major Customers\nThe Company's largest customer, US Foods, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. A contract between our subsidiary, Food Innovations, and USF entered an optional renewal period in December 2012 but was automatically extended for an additional 12 months in each of January 1, 2013 and 2014. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods, Inc. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days' notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through 2017.\nIndex\nITEM 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nBonita Springs, Florida\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and subsidiaries ( the Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its Internal Control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n/s/ LIGGETT & WEBB, P.A.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 30, 2017\nIndex\nInnovative Food Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>
