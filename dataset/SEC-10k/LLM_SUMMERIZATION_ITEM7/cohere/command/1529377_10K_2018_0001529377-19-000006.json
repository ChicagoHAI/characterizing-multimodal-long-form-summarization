Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\nWe are a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans and related investments. We are externally managed by Ares Commercial Real Estate Management LLC ( ACREM\u201d or our Manager\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement dated April 25, 2012, as amended, between us and our Manager (the Management Agreement\u201d). From the commencement of our operations in late 2011, we have been primarily focused on directly originating and managing a diversified portfolio of CRE debt-related investments for our own account.\nWe were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that is intended to permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d).\nSale of Mortgage Banking Subsidiary\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, the Agreement\u201d) with Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the Buyer\u201d), to sell ACRE Capital Holdings LLC ( TRS Holdings\u201d), the holding company that owned our mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital LLC ( ACRE Capital\u201d). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, on September 30, 2016, the Buyer purchased from us all of the outstanding common units of TRS Holdings (the ACRE Capital Sale\u201d). ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises and by government agencies.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Buyer paid approximately $93 million in cash as consideration for the ACRE Capital Sale. We recognized a net gain on the sale of TRS Holdings of approximately $10.2 million.\nAs a result of the sale of TRS Holdings, the operations of the mortgage banking segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the ACRE Capital Sale, we now conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments; therefore, we no longer provide segment reporting.\nBelow are significant developments during the year ended December 31, 2018 presented by quarter:\nDevelopments During the First Quarter of 2018:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ACRE originated a $16.7 million senior mortgage loan on the construction of a residential property located in California.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ACRE originated a $21.7 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ACRE originated a $56.1 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in California.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ACRE exercised a 12-month extension option on the CNB Facility (as defined below) to extend the initial maturity date to March 10, 2019.

In addition, ACRE amended the Citibank Facility to decrease the interest rate on advances from a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 2.25% to 2.50%, subject to certain exceptions, to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%, subject to certain exceptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Fair Value of Our Assets. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nLoans are generally collateralized by real estate and as a result, the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, are regularly evaluated. We monitor performance of our investment portfolio under the following methodology: (1) borrower review, which analyzes the borrower's ability to execute on its original business plan, reviews its financial condition, assesses pending litigation and considers its general level of responsiveness and cooperation; (2) economic review, which considers underlying collateral (i.e., leasing performance, unit sales and cash flow of the collateral and its ability to cover debt service as well as the residual loan balance at maturity); (3) property review, which considers current environmental risks, changes in insurance costs or coverage, current site visibility, capital expenditures and market perception; and (4) market review, which analyzes the collateral from a supply and demand perspective of similar property types, as well as from a capital markets perspective. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, and the borrower's exit plan, among other factors. Other than as set forth in Note 3 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. There were no impairments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough we generally hold our target investments as long-term investments, we may occasionally classify some of our investments as held for sale. Investments held for sale will be carried at fair value within loans held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The fees received are deferred and recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale. At this time, we do not expect to hold any of our investments for trading purposes.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, subject to any applicable ceilings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the value of our mortgage loans to decline;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to higher interest rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to increase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease, subject to any applicable floors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the value of our mortgage loan portfolio to increase, for such mortgages with applicable floors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to lower interest rates, subject to any applicable floors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to decrease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Risk. We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target investments. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate or acquire investments of higher quality at appropriate prices with appropriate risk adjusted returns given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated or acquired investments (see the performance monitoring methodology above in Changes in Fair Value of Our Assets). Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results and stockholders' equity.\nMarket Conditions. We believe that our target investments currently present attractive risk-adjusted return profiles, given the underlying property fundamentals and the competitive landscape for the type of capital we provide. We believe that growth in commercial real estate valuations has been supported by a lower supply of new properties, which broadly have remained below the long-term average since the onset of the global financial crisis. New additions to inventory have been limited given that new construction financing has been constrained by post-recession financial regulations. While the availability of debt capital for high quality assets has increased and led to more competitive pricing and terms, we continue to anticipate rising demand for the type of customized debt financing we provide from borrowers or sponsors. We also envision that demand for financing will be strong for situations in which a property is being acquired with plans to improve the net operating income through capital improvements, leasing, cost savings or other key initiatives and realize the improved value through a subsequent sale or refinancing. We believe market conditions continue to be favorable for disciplined and scaled direct lending with broad and flexible product offerings. However, we are mindful that rising interest rates and the removal of certain central banking monetary policies may impact asset values and could lead to periods of volatility. Ultimately, during periods of sustained volatility, increased lending opportunities may arise for flexible capital providers like us.\nPerformance of Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to economic conditions. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during periods of stronger economic conditions, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes and loan origination volumes. During periods of weaker economic conditions, multifamily and\nother commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations.\nAvailability of Leverage and Equity. We expect to use leverage to make additional investments that may increase our potential returns. We may not be able to obtain the amount of leverage we desire and, consequently, the returns generated from our investments may be less than we currently expect. To grow our portfolio of investments, we also may determine to raise additional equity. Our access to additional equity will depend on many factors, and our ability to raise equity in the future cannot be predicted at this time.\nSize of Portfolio. The size of our portfolio of investments, as measured both by the aggregate principal balance and the number of our CRE loans and our other investments, will also be an important factor in determining our operating results. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we receive will increase and we may achieve certain economies of scale and diversify risk within our portfolio investments. A larger portfolio, however, may result in increased expenses; for example, we may incur additional interest expense or other costs to finance our investments. Also, if the aggregate principal balance of our portfolio grows but the number of our loans or the number of our borrowers does not grow, we could face increased risk by reason of the concentration of our investments.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 44 loans held for investment, excluding 76 loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $1.7 billion and outstanding principal was $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we funded approximately $544.2 million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $746.8 million of outstanding principal. As of December 31, 2018, 89.8% of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) floors, with a weighted average floor of 1.38%, calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or L\u201d are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated).\nOther than as set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment.\nOur loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of December 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Principal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Remaining Life (Years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior mortgage loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,489,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,498,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments\n</td> <td>35,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans held for investment portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,534,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults.

In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding. See Notes 6 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about ACRC KA.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policy represents an area where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Loans Held for Investment. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nEach loan classified as held for investment is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans are generally collateralized by real estate or the equity of the real estate owner. The extent of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property and the financial and operating capability of the borrower could impact the expected amounts received.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, which describes recent accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or are currently evaluating.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn January 11, 2019, ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2017-FL3 Ltd. (the Issuer\u201d) and ACRE Commercial Mortgage\n2017-FL3 LLC (the Co-Issuer\u201d), both wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of ours, entered into an Amended and Restated Indenture (the Amended Indenture\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as advancing agent and note administrator, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, which governs the approximately $504.1 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes issued by the Issuer and $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer (the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization\u201d). The Amended Indenture amends and restates, and replaces in its entirety, the indenture for the CLO Securitization issued in March 2017, which governed the issuance of approximately $308.8 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes and $32.4 million of preferred equity in the Issuer. After giving effect to the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization, we retained (through one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries) approximately $58.5 million of the non-investment grade notes and all of the $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer, which notes and preferred equity were not offered to investors. The secured floating rate notes are collateralized by interests in a pool of 17 mortgage assets having an aggregate principal balance of $557.0 million.\nOn February 6, 2019, we originated and fully funded a $30.0 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in North Carolina. The loan has a per annum interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 3.15% (plus fees) and an initial term of three years.\nOn February 14, 2019, we originated a $100.6 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in Florida.

The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the UBS Facility and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined below and collectively, the Secured Funding Agreements\u201d) and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan (as defined below) were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earnings assets and weighted average borrowings as well as an increase in 30-day LIBOR for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net interest margin was approximately $46.3 million and $45.1 million, respectively.

As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in incentive fees due to our Manager, an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $15.0 million and $14.4 million, respectively. As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees and general and administrative expenses due to our Manager that were allocated to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and partially offset by a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nRelated Party Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses included $7.4 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.3 million in management fees and $1.2 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses also included $3.6 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. The management fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in incentive fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Core Earnings\u201d is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of our target investments are structured as debt and we foreclose on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. The decrease in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in the percentage of time allocated to us by employees of our Manager due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses included $6.0 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $5.6 million in management fees and $0.3 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses also included $3.4 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager\npursuant to the Management Agreement. The increase in management fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees that were allocated to continuing operations subsequent to the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale on September 30, 2016. The incentive fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in general and administrative expenses that were allocated to continuing operations as employees of our Manager allocated a significant percentage of their time during the year ended December 31, 2016 to discontinued operations for due diligence work associated with the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale.\nOther Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, professional fees were $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, general and administrative expenses were $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to new restricted stock grants awarded after December 31, 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, professional fees were $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, general and administrative expenses were $2.8 million.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt Costs\nIn December 2017, we voluntarily elected to repay $45.0 million of outstanding principal on our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) prior to the scheduled maturity as permitted by the contractual terms of the Secured Term Loan. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred early extinguishment of debt costs of $0.8 million, which was a non-cash charge incurred in connection with the $45.0 million repayment of outstanding principal on the Secured Term Loan. The early extinguishment of debt costs was comprised of the pro-rata share of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discounts being allocated to the outstanding principal that was repaid.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay\nborrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, make principal and interest payments on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our Secured Funding Agreements, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating activities. However, principal repayments from mortgage loans in securitizations where we retain the subordinate securities are applied sequentially, first used to pay down the senior notes, and accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the securitizations until all senior notes are repaid in full. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from the 1940 Act, we expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit, secured funding and other lending facilities, (b) securitizations, (c) other sources of private financing, including warehouse and repurchase facilities, and (d) public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities. We may seek to sell certain of our investments in order to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risk, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. In instances where we do not have sufficient available liquidity to originate mortgage loans, Ares Management or one of its investment vehicles may originate such mortgage loans and we may have the opportunity to purchase such loans that are determined by our Manager in good faith to be appropriate for us, once we have sufficient available liquidity.\nEquity Offerings\nThere were no shares issued in public offerings of our equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which are inclusive of amounts related to discontinued operations ($ in thousands):\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>39,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>157,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(405,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(214,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,923\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased (decreased) by $(17.3) million, $(18.9) million and $8.3 million, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million and $31.3 million, respectively.

This change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily related to the cash used to originate and fund mortgage loans held for sale exceeding the proceeds received from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan origination fees and costs of $6.6 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.6 million and change in other assets of $2.5 million.

This change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment exceeding the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in investing activities totaled $405.8 million and $60.3 million, respectively. This change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment exceeding the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities totaled $214.4 million and primarily related to repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $822.2 million and dividends paid of $32.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $642.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $355.6 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $923.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt of consolidated VIEs of $272.9 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $746.6 million, repayments of our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $45.0 million and dividends paid of $30.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $73.1 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.3 billion, proceeds from our Warehouse Lines of Credit (as defined below) of $863.4 million and proceeds from our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $80.0 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.0 billion, repayments of debt of consolidated VIEs of $255.3 million, repayments of our Warehouse Lines of Credit of $795.7 million and dividends paid of $29.4 million.\nWe, through our previously owned subsidiary, ACRE Capital, borrowed funds under the ASAP Line of Credit and the BAML Line of Credit (individually defined below and together, the Warehouse Lines of Credit\u201d). ACRE Capital was party to an $80.0 million multifamily as soon as pooled sale agreement (the ASAP Line of Credit\u201d) with the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) to finance installments received from Fannie Mae. ACRE Capital was party to a $135.0 million line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended and restated, the BAML Line of Credit\u201d), which was used to finance mortgage loans originated by ACRE Capital.\nSummary of Financing Agreements\nThe sources of financing, as applicable

As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of each respective Financing Agreement. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our Financing Agreements.\nSecuritizations\nWe may seek to enhance the returns on our senior mortgage loan investments through securitizations, if available. To the extent available, we intend to securitize the senior portion of some of our loans, while retaining the subordinate securities in our investment portfolio. The securitization of this senior portion will be accounted for as either a sale\u201d and the loans will be removed from our balance sheet or as a financing\u201d and will be classified as loans held for investment\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets, depending upon the structure of the securitization. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount and outstanding principal of our CLO Securitization was $270.7 million and $272.9 million, respectively. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of our CLO Securitization. See Recent Developments\u201d and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a subsequent event related to the CLO Securitization.\nCapital Markets\nWe may periodically raise additional capital through public offerings of debt and equity securities to fund new investments. On June 6, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), which became effective on August 29, 2016, in order to permit us to offer, from time to time, in one or more offerings or series of offerings up to $1.25 billion of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock, warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, or units.\nOther Sources of Financing\nIn addition to the sources of liquidity described above, in the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments or to refinance expiring Financing Agreements and securitizations, including other credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities, non-convertible or convertible debt, securitized\nfinancings and other public and private forms of borrowing. These financings may be issued by us or our subsidiaries, be collateralized or non-collateralized, accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates and may involve one or more lenders.\nLeverage Policies\nWe intend to use prudent amounts of leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. To that end, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we intend to continue to use borrowings to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments. Given current market conditions and our focus on first or senior mortgages, we currently expect that such leverage would not exceed, on a debt-to-equity basis, a 4-to-1 ratio. Our charter and bylaws do not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use. The amount of leverage we will deploy for particular investments in our target investments will depend upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic regions and commercial mortgage markets, our outlook for the level and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are described in the following table ($ in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Citibank Facility\n</td> <td>184,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BAML Facility\n</td> <td>36,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CNB Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Facility\n</td> <td>135,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Bank Facility\n</td> <td>148,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Term Loan\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Loan Funding Commitments\n</td> <td>142,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above does not include the related interest expense under the Secured Funding Agreements and the Secured Term Loan, as all our interest is variable. Additionally, the table above does not include extension options, as applicable, under the Secured Funding Agreements.\nWe may enter into certain contracts that may contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with underwriters and counterparties to repurchase agreements. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nManagement Agreement\nWe are also required to pay our Manager a base management fee of 1.5% of our stockholders' equity per year, an incentive fee and expense reimbursements pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate annually distributing to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at\nregular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if a REIT distributes less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to its stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then it is required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if a REIT elects to retain any of its net capital gain for any tax year, it must notify its stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain) will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.\nBefore we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our Financing Agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have commitments to fund various senior mortgage loans, as well as subordinated debt and preferred equity investments in our portfolio.\nOther than as set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose entities or VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intend to provide additional funding to any such entities.", "summary": "- According to the

Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\nWe are a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans and related investments. We are externally managed by Ares Commercial Real Estate Management LLC ( ACREM\u201d or our Manager\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement dated April 25, 2012, as amended, between us and our Manager (the Management Agreement\u201d). From the commencement of our operations in late 2011, we have been primarily focused on directly originating and managing a diversified portfolio of CRE debt-related investments for our own account.\nWe were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that is intended to permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d).\nSale of Mortgage Banking Subsidiary\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, the Agreement\u201d) with Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the Buyer\u201d), to sell ACRE Capital Holdings LLC ( TRS Holdings\u201d), the holding company that owned our mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital LLC ( ACRE Capital\u201d). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, on September 30, 2016, the Buyer purchased from us all of the outstanding common units of TRS Holdings (the ACRE Capital Sale\u201d). ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises and by government agencies.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Buyer paid approximately $93 million in cash as consideration for the ACRE Capital Sale. We recognized a net gain on the sale of TRS Holdings of approximately $10.2 million.\nAs a result of the sale of TRS Holdings, the operations of the mortgage banking segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the ACRE Capital Sale, we now conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments; therefore, we no longer provide segment reporting.\nBelow are significant developments during the year ended December 31, 2018 presented by quarter:\nDevelopments During the First Quarter of 2018:\n \u2022 ACRE originated a $16.7 million senior mortgage loan on the construction of a residential property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $21.7 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $56.1 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE exercised a 12-month extension option on the CNB Facility (as defined below) to extend the initial maturity date to March 10, 2019. ACRE has one additional 12-month extension option, which, if exercised, would extend the maturity date of the CNB Facility to March 10, 2020. \nDevelopments During the Second Quarter of 2018:\n \u2022 ACRE originated a $39.2 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in South Carolina. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $32.9 million senior mortgage loan on a hotel property located in Illinois. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $68.1 million senior mortgage loan on a portfolio of hotel properties located in Oregon and Washington. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $15.3 million mezzanine loan on the construction of a mixed-use property located in Illinois. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $59.6 million senior mortgage loan on an office property located in Illinois. \n \u2022 ACRE amended the BAML Facility (as defined below), which has a commitment amount of $125.0 million, to extend the period during which we may request individual loans under the facility to May 23, 2019. In addition, the final maturity date of individual loans under the BAML Facility was extended to May 23, 2022. \nDevelopments During the Third Quarter of 2018:\n \u2022 ACRE originated a $31.5 million senior mortgage loan on a hotel property located in Minnesota. \n \u2022 ACRE originated an $8.0 million pre-construction mezzanine loan on a property with in-place development rights for a residential condominium project located in Hawaii. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $78.0 million senior mortgage loan on a hotel portfolio located across multiple states. \nDevelopments During the Fourth Quarter of 2018:\n \u2022 ACRE originated a $17.5 million pre-construction senior mortgage loan on a property with in-place development rights for a residential condominium project located in Florida. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $14.0 million mezzanine construction loan on a property with in-place development rights for a residential condominium conversion project located in New York. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $13.5 million senior mortgage loan on an office property located in North Carolina. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $22.9 million senior mortgage loan on an office property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $40.0 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Illinois. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $30.3 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Pennsylvania. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $43.5 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Florida. \n \u2022 ACRE amended the Wells Fargo Facility (as defined below), which has a commitment amount of $500.0 million, to extend the initial maturity date to December 14, 2020 and decrease the interest rate on advances from a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a pricing margin range of 1.75% to 2.35% to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%. The initial maturity date of the Wells Fargo Facility is subject to three 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at ACRE's option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee, which, if all three were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the Wells Fargo Facility to December 14, 2023. \n \u2022 ACRE amended the Citibank Facility (as defined below) to increase the facility's commitment amount from $250.0 million to $325.0 million and extend the initial maturity date to December 13, 2021. The initial maturity date of the Citibank Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at ACRE's option assuming no existing defaults under the Citibank Facility and applicable extension fees being paid, which, if both were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the Citibank Facility to December 13, 2023. In addition, ACRE amended the Citibank Facility to decrease the interest rate on advances from a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 2.25% to 2.50%, subject to certain exceptions, to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%, subject to certain exceptions. \nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Fair Value of Our Assets. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nLoans are generally collateralized by real estate and as a result, the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, are regularly evaluated. We monitor performance of our investment portfolio under the following methodology: (1) borrower review, which analyzes the borrower's ability to execute on its original business plan, reviews its financial condition, assesses pending litigation and considers its general level of responsiveness and cooperation; (2) economic review, which considers underlying collateral (i.e., leasing performance, unit sales and cash flow of the collateral and its ability to cover debt service as well as the residual loan balance at maturity); (3) property review, which considers current environmental risks, changes in insurance costs or coverage, current site visibility, capital expenditures and market perception; and (4) market review, which analyzes the collateral from a supply and demand perspective of similar property types, as well as from a capital markets perspective. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, and the borrower's exit plan, among other factors. Other than as set forth in Note 3 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. There were no impairments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough we generally hold our target investments as long-term investments, we may occasionally classify some of our investments as held for sale. Investments held for sale will be carried at fair value within loans held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The fees received are deferred and recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale. At this time, we do not expect to hold any of our investments for trading purposes.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, subject to any applicable ceilings; \n \u2022 the value of our mortgage loans to decline; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to higher interest rates; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to increase. \nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease, subject to any applicable floors; \n \u2022 the value of our mortgage loan portfolio to increase, for such mortgages with applicable floors; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to lower interest rates, subject to any applicable floors; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to decrease. \nCredit Risk. We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target investments. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate or acquire investments of higher quality at appropriate prices with appropriate risk adjusted returns given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated or acquired investments (see the performance monitoring methodology above in Changes in Fair Value of Our Assets). Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results and stockholders' equity.\nMarket Conditions. We believe that our target investments currently present attractive risk-adjusted return profiles, given the underlying property fundamentals and the competitive landscape for the type of capital we provide. We believe that growth in commercial real estate valuations has been supported by a lower supply of new properties, which broadly have remained below the long-term average since the onset of the global financial crisis. New additions to inventory have been limited given that new construction financing has been constrained by post-recession financial regulations. While the availability of debt capital for high quality assets has increased and led to more competitive pricing and terms, we continue to anticipate rising demand for the type of customized debt financing we provide from borrowers or sponsors. We also envision that demand for financing will be strong for situations in which a property is being acquired with plans to improve the net operating income through capital improvements, leasing, cost savings or other key initiatives and realize the improved value through a subsequent sale or refinancing. We believe market conditions continue to be favorable for disciplined and scaled direct lending with broad and flexible product offerings. However, we are mindful that rising interest rates and the removal of certain central banking monetary policies may impact asset values and could lead to periods of volatility. Ultimately, during periods of sustained volatility, increased lending opportunities may arise for flexible capital providers like us.\nPerformance of Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to economic conditions. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during periods of stronger economic conditions, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes and loan origination volumes. During periods of weaker economic conditions, multifamily and\nother commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations.\nAvailability of Leverage and Equity. We expect to use leverage to make additional investments that may increase our potential returns. We may not be able to obtain the amount of leverage we desire and, consequently, the returns generated from our investments may be less than we currently expect. To grow our portfolio of investments, we also may determine to raise additional equity. Our access to additional equity will depend on many factors, and our ability to raise equity in the future cannot be predicted at this time.\nSize of Portfolio. The size of our portfolio of investments, as measured both by the aggregate principal balance and the number of our CRE loans and our other investments, will also be an important factor in determining our operating results. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we receive will increase and we may achieve certain economies of scale and diversify risk within our portfolio investments. A larger portfolio, however, may result in increased expenses; for example, we may incur additional interest expense or other costs to finance our investments. Also, if the aggregate principal balance of our portfolio grows but the number of our loans or the number of our borrowers does not grow, we could face increased risk by reason of the concentration of our investments.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 44 loans held for investment, excluding 76 loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $1.7 billion and outstanding principal was $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we funded approximately $544.2 million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $746.8 million of outstanding principal. As of December 31, 2018, 89.8% of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) floors, with a weighted average floor of 1.38%, calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or L\u201d are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated).\nOther than as set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment.\nOur loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of December 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. \n (2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. \n (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of December 31, 2018 as weighted by the outstanding principal balance of each loan. \nNon-Controlling Interests\nThe non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC ( ACRC KA\u201d) that are not owned by us. In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding. See Notes 6 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about ACRC KA.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policy represents an area where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Loans Held for Investment. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nEach loan classified as held for investment is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans are generally collateralized by real estate or the equity of the real estate owner. The extent of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property and the financial and operating capability of the borrower could impact the expected amounts received.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, which describes recent accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or are currently evaluating.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn January 11, 2019, ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2017-FL3 Ltd. (the Issuer\u201d) and ACRE Commercial Mortgage\n2017-FL3 LLC (the Co-Issuer\u201d), both wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of ours, entered into an Amended and Restated Indenture (the Amended Indenture\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as advancing agent and note administrator, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, which governs the approximately $504.1 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes issued by the Issuer and $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer (the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization\u201d). The Amended Indenture amends and restates, and replaces in its entirety, the indenture for the CLO Securitization issued in March 2017, which governed the issuance of approximately $308.8 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes and $32.4 million of preferred equity in the Issuer. After giving effect to the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization, we retained (through one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries) approximately $58.5 million of the non-investment grade notes and all of the $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer, which notes and preferred equity were not offered to investors. The secured floating rate notes are collateralized by interests in a pool of 17 mortgage assets having an aggregate principal balance of $557.0 million.\nOn February 6, 2019, we originated and fully funded a $30.0 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in North Carolina. The loan has a per annum interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 3.15% (plus fees) and an initial term of three years.\nOn February 14, 2019, we originated a $100.6 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in Florida. At closing, the outstanding principal balance was approximately $37.0 million. The loan has a per annum interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.25% (plus fees) and an initial term of two years.\nOn February 21, 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.33 per common share for the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter 2019 dividend is payable on April 16, 2019 to common stockholders of record on March 29, 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 ($ in thousands):\n\nThe following tables set forth select details of our consolidated results of operations from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 ($ in thousands):\nNet Interest Margin \nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net interest margin was approximately $55.3 million and $46.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest income from loans held for investment of $118.3 million and $97.5 million, respectively, was generated by weighted average earning assets of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, offset by $63.0 million and $51.2 million, respectively, of interest expense, unused fees and amortization of deferred loan costs. The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the UBS Facility and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined below and collectively, the Secured Funding Agreements\u201d) and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan (as defined below) were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earnings assets and weighted average borrowings as well as an increase in 30-day LIBOR for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net interest margin was approximately $46.3 million and $45.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest income from loans held for investment of $97.5 million and $82.0 million, respectively, was generated by weighted average earning assets of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, offset by $51.2 million and $36.9 million, respectively, of interest expense, unused fees and amortization of deferred loan costs. The weighted average borrowings under the Secured Funding Agreements and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan were $1.1 billion and $889.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earnings assets and weighted average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThe operating expenses below do not include expenses of ACRE Capital. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about the operating expenses of ACRE Capital.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred operating expenses of $16.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively. As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in incentive fees due to our Manager, an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $15.0 million and $14.4 million, respectively. As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees and general and administrative expenses due to our Manager that were allocated to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and partially offset by a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nRelated Party Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses included $7.4 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.3 million in management fees and $1.2 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses also included $3.6 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. The management fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in incentive fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Core Earnings\u201d is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of our target investments are structured as debt and we foreclose on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. The decrease in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in the percentage of time allocated to us by employees of our Manager due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses included $6.0 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $5.6 million in management fees and $0.3 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses also included $3.4 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager\npursuant to the Management Agreement. The increase in management fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees that were allocated to continuing operations subsequent to the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale on September 30, 2016. The incentive fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in general and administrative expenses that were allocated to continuing operations as employees of our Manager allocated a significant percentage of their time during the year ended December 31, 2016 to discontinued operations for due diligence work associated with the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale.\nOther Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, professional fees were $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, general and administrative expenses were $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to new restricted stock grants awarded after December 31, 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, professional fees were $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, general and administrative expenses were $2.8 million.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt Costs\nIn December 2017, we voluntarily elected to repay $45.0 million of outstanding principal on our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) prior to the scheduled maturity as permitted by the contractual terms of the Secured Term Loan. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred early extinguishment of debt costs of $0.8 million, which was a non-cash charge incurred in connection with the $45.0 million repayment of outstanding principal on the Secured Term Loan. The early extinguishment of debt costs was comprised of the pro-rata share of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discounts being allocated to the outstanding principal that was repaid.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay\nborrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, make principal and interest payments on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our Secured Funding Agreements, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating activities. However, principal repayments from mortgage loans in securitizations where we retain the subordinate securities are applied sequentially, first used to pay down the senior notes, and accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the securitizations until all senior notes are repaid in full. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from the 1940 Act, we expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit, secured funding and other lending facilities, (b) securitizations, (c) other sources of private financing, including warehouse and repurchase facilities, and (d) public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities. We may seek to sell certain of our investments in order to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risk, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. In instances where we do not have sufficient available liquidity to originate mortgage loans, Ares Management or one of its investment vehicles may originate such mortgage loans and we may have the opportunity to purchase such loans that are determined by our Manager in good faith to be appropriate for us, once we have sufficient available liquidity.\nEquity Offerings\nThere were no shares issued in public offerings of our equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which are inclusive of amounts related to discontinued operations ($ in thousands):\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased (decreased) by $(17.3) million, $(18.9) million and $8.3 million, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million and $31.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan origination fees and costs of $6.9 million and amortization of deferred financing costs of $5.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan origination fees and costs of $6.6 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.6 million and change in other assets of $2.5 million.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $31.3 million and $(4.5) million, respectively. This change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily related to the cash used to originate and fund mortgage loans held for sale exceeding the proceeds received from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan origination fees and costs of $6.6 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.6 million and change in other assets of $2.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included originations of mortgage loans held for sale of $639.4 million, sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties of $571.7 million, change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs\u201d) of $6.5 million, gain on sale of discontinued operations of $10.2 million, change in other assets of $40.0 million and change in other liabilities of $10.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled $157.9 million and $(405.8) million, respectively. This change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment exceeding the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in investing activities totaled $405.8 million and $60.3 million, respectively. This change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment exceeding the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities totaled $214.4 million and primarily related to repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $822.2 million and dividends paid of $32.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $642.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $355.6 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $923.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt of consolidated VIEs of $272.9 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $746.6 million, repayments of our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $45.0 million and dividends paid of $30.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $73.1 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.3 billion, proceeds from our Warehouse Lines of Credit (as defined below) of $863.4 million and proceeds from our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $80.0 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.0 billion, repayments of debt of consolidated VIEs of $255.3 million, repayments of our Warehouse Lines of Credit of $795.7 million and dividends paid of $29.4 million.\nWe, through our previously owned subsidiary, ACRE Capital, borrowed funds under the ASAP Line of Credit and the BAML Line of Credit (individually defined below and together, the Warehouse Lines of Credit\u201d). ACRE Capital was party to an $80.0 million multifamily as soon as pooled sale agreement (the ASAP Line of Credit\u201d) with the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) to finance installments received from Fannie Mae. ACRE Capital was party to a $135.0 million line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended and restated, the BAML Line of Credit\u201d), which was used to finance mortgage loans originated by ACRE Capital.\nSummary of Financing Agreements\nThe sources of financing, as applicable in a given period, under our Secured Funding Agreements and the Secured Term Loan (collectively, the Financing Agreements\u201d) are described in the following table ($ in thousands):\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) The maturity date of the master repurchase funding facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Wells Fargo Facility\u201d) is subject to three 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In December 2018, we amended the Wells Fargo Facility to extend the initial maturity date to December 14, 2020 and decrease the interest rate on advances to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%. \n (2) The maturity date of the master repurchase facility with Citibank, N.A. (the Citibank Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. As of December 31, 2017, the Citibank Facility had an accordion feature that provided for an increase in the $250.0 million commitment amount with respect to approved assets, as determined by Citibank, N.A. in its sole discretion. In December 2018, we amended the Citibank Facility to increase the facility's commitment amount from $250.0 million to $325.0 million, extend the initial maturity date to December 13, 2021, decrease the interest rate on advances to a per \nannum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25% and remove the accordion feature.\n (3) Individual advances on loans under the Bridge Loan Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the BAML Facility\u201d) generally have a two-year maturity, subject to a 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In May 2018, we amended the BAML Facility to extend the period during which we may request individual loans under the facility to May 23, 2019. In addition, the final maturity date of individual loans under the BAML Facility was extended to May 23, 2022. \n (4) The maturity date of the secured revolving funding facility with City National Bank (the CNB Facility\u201d) is subject to one 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In February 2018, we exercised a 12-month extension option on the CNB Facility to extend the maturity date to March 10, 2019. \n (5) The maturity date of the revolving master repurchase facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the MetLife Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. \n (6) The interest rate on advances under the revolving master repurchase facility with UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (the UBS Facility\u201d) was the sum of one-month LIBOR plus (i) 1.88% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance for one year or less, (ii) 2.08% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance in excess of one year but less than two years, and (iii) 2.28% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance for more than two years. In October 2018, the UBS Facility matured. The UBS Facility had been repaid in full and its term was not extended. \n (7) The maturity date of the master repurchase and securities contract with U.S. Bank National Association (the U.S. Bank Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. \n (8) The maturity date of the Credit and Guaranty Agreement with the lenders referred to therein and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders (the Secured Term Loan\u201d), is subject to one 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met. \nOur Financing Agreements contain various affirmative and negative covenants, including negative pledges, and provisions related to events of default that are normal and customary for similar financing agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of each respective Financing Agreement. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our Financing Agreements.\nSecuritizations\nWe may seek to enhance the returns on our senior mortgage loan investments through securitizations, if available. To the extent available, we intend to securitize the senior portion of some of our loans, while retaining the subordinate securities in our investment portfolio. The securitization of this senior portion will be accounted for as either a sale\u201d and the loans will be removed from our balance sheet or as a financing\u201d and will be classified as loans held for investment\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets, depending upon the structure of the securitization. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount and outstanding principal of our CLO Securitization was $270.7 million and $272.9 million, respectively. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of our CLO Securitization. See Recent Developments\u201d and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a subsequent event related to the CLO Securitization.\nCapital Markets\nWe may periodically raise additional capital through public offerings of debt and equity securities to fund new investments. On June 6, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), which became effective on August 29, 2016, in order to permit us to offer, from time to time, in one or more offerings or series of offerings up to $1.25 billion of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock, warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, or units.\nOther Sources of Financing\nIn addition to the sources of liquidity described above, in the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments or to refinance expiring Financing Agreements and securitizations, including other credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities, non-convertible or convertible debt, securitized\nfinancings and other public and private forms of borrowing. These financings may be issued by us or our subsidiaries, be collateralized or non-collateralized, accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates and may involve one or more lenders.\nLeverage Policies\nWe intend to use prudent amounts of leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. To that end, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we intend to continue to use borrowings to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments. Given current market conditions and our focus on first or senior mortgages, we currently expect that such leverage would not exceed, on a debt-to-equity basis, a 4-to-1 ratio. Our charter and bylaws do not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use. The amount of leverage we will deploy for particular investments in our target investments will depend upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic regions and commercial mortgage markets, our outlook for the level and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are described in the following table ($ in thousands):\n\nThe table above does not include the related interest expense under the Secured Funding Agreements and the Secured Term Loan, as all our interest is variable. Additionally, the table above does not include extension options, as applicable, under the Secured Funding Agreements.\nWe may enter into certain contracts that may contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with underwriters and counterparties to repurchase agreements. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nManagement Agreement\nWe are also required to pay our Manager a base management fee of 1.5% of our stockholders' equity per year, an incentive fee and expense reimbursements pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate annually distributing to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at\nregular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if a REIT distributes less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to its stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then it is required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if a REIT elects to retain any of its net capital gain for any tax year, it must notify its stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain) will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.\nBefore we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our Financing Agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have commitments to fund various senior mortgage loans, as well as subordinated debt and preferred equity investments in our portfolio.\nOther than as set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\nWe are a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) loans and related investments. We are externally managed by Ares Commercial Real Estate Management LLC ( ACREM\u201d or our Manager\u201d), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management\u201d), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, pursuant to the terms of the management agreement dated April 25, 2012, as amended, between us and our Manager (the Management Agreement\u201d). From the commencement of our operations in late 2011, we have been primarily focused on directly originating and managing a diversified portfolio of CRE debt-related investments for our own account.\nWe were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that is intended to permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d).\nSale of Mortgage Banking Subsidiary\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, the Agreement\u201d) with Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (the Buyer\u201d), to sell ACRE Capital Holdings LLC ( TRS Holdings\u201d), the holding company that owned our mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital LLC ( ACRE Capital\u201d). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, on September 30, 2016, the Buyer purchased from us all of the outstanding common units of TRS Holdings (the ACRE Capital Sale\u201d). ACRE Capital primarily originated, sold and serviced multifamily and senior-living related loans under programs offered by government-sponsored enterprises and by government agencies.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Buyer paid approximately $93 million in cash as consideration for the ACRE Capital Sale. We recognized a net gain on the sale of TRS Holdings of approximately $10.2 million.\nAs a result of the sale of TRS Holdings, the operations of the mortgage banking segment have been reclassified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the ACRE Capital Sale, we now conduct and manage our business as one operating segment, rather than multiple operating segments; therefore, we no longer provide segment reporting.\nBelow are significant developments during the year ended December 31, 2018 presented by quarter:\nDevelopments During the First Quarter of 2018:\n \u2022 ACRE originated a $16.7 million senior mortgage loan on the construction of a residential property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $21.7 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE originated a $56.1 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in California. \n \u2022 ACRE exercised a 12-month extension option on the CNB Facility (as defined below) to extend the initial maturity date to March 10, 2019.

In addition, ACRE amended the Citibank Facility to decrease the interest rate on advances from a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 2.25% to 2.50%, subject to certain exceptions, to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%, subject to certain exceptions. \nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Fair Value of Our Assets. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nLoans are generally collateralized by real estate and as a result, the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, are regularly evaluated. We monitor performance of our investment portfolio under the following methodology: (1) borrower review, which analyzes the borrower's ability to execute on its original business plan, reviews its financial condition, assesses pending litigation and considers its general level of responsiveness and cooperation; (2) economic review, which considers underlying collateral (i.e., leasing performance, unit sales and cash flow of the collateral and its ability to cover debt service as well as the residual loan balance at maturity); (3) property review, which considers current environmental risks, changes in insurance costs or coverage, current site visibility, capital expenditures and market perception; and (4) market review, which analyzes the collateral from a supply and demand perspective of similar property types, as well as from a capital markets perspective. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, and the borrower's exit plan, among other factors. Other than as set forth in Note 3 to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. There were no impairments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough we generally hold our target investments as long-term investments, we may occasionally classify some of our investments as held for sale. Investments held for sale will be carried at fair value within loans held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The fees received are deferred and recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale. At this time, we do not expect to hold any of our investments for trading purposes.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, subject to any applicable ceilings; \n \u2022 the value of our mortgage loans to decline; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to higher interest rates; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to increase. \nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause:\n \u2022 the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease, subject to any applicable floors; \n \u2022 the value of our mortgage loan portfolio to increase, for such mortgages with applicable floors; \n \u2022 coupons on our floating rate mortgage loans to reset to lower interest rates, subject to any applicable floors; and \n \u2022 to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy where we pay fixed and receive floating interest rates, the value of these agreements to decrease. \nCredit Risk. We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target investments. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate or acquire investments of higher quality at appropriate prices with appropriate risk adjusted returns given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated or acquired investments (see the performance monitoring methodology above in Changes in Fair Value of Our Assets). Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results and stockholders' equity.\nMarket Conditions. We believe that our target investments currently present attractive risk-adjusted return profiles, given the underlying property fundamentals and the competitive landscape for the type of capital we provide. We believe that growth in commercial real estate valuations has been supported by a lower supply of new properties, which broadly have remained below the long-term average since the onset of the global financial crisis. New additions to inventory have been limited given that new construction financing has been constrained by post-recession financial regulations. While the availability of debt capital for high quality assets has increased and led to more competitive pricing and terms, we continue to anticipate rising demand for the type of customized debt financing we provide from borrowers or sponsors. We also envision that demand for financing will be strong for situations in which a property is being acquired with plans to improve the net operating income through capital improvements, leasing, cost savings or other key initiatives and realize the improved value through a subsequent sale or refinancing. We believe market conditions continue to be favorable for disciplined and scaled direct lending with broad and flexible product offerings. However, we are mindful that rising interest rates and the removal of certain central banking monetary policies may impact asset values and could lead to periods of volatility. Ultimately, during periods of sustained volatility, increased lending opportunities may arise for flexible capital providers like us.\nPerformance of Commercial Real Estate Related Markets. Our business is dependent on the general demand for, and value of, commercial real estate and related services, which are sensitive to economic conditions. Demand for multifamily and other commercial real estate generally increases during periods of stronger economic conditions, resulting in increased property values, transaction volumes and loan origination volumes. During periods of weaker economic conditions, multifamily and\nother commercial real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower demand and reduced values. These conditions can result in lower property transaction volumes and loan originations.\nAvailability of Leverage and Equity. We expect to use leverage to make additional investments that may increase our potential returns. We may not be able to obtain the amount of leverage we desire and, consequently, the returns generated from our investments may be less than we currently expect. To grow our portfolio of investments, we also may determine to raise additional equity. Our access to additional equity will depend on many factors, and our ability to raise equity in the future cannot be predicted at this time.\nSize of Portfolio. The size of our portfolio of investments, as measured both by the aggregate principal balance and the number of our CRE loans and our other investments, will also be an important factor in determining our operating results. Generally, as the size of our portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we receive will increase and we may achieve certain economies of scale and diversify risk within our portfolio investments. A larger portfolio, however, may result in increased expenses; for example, we may incur additional interest expense or other costs to finance our investments. Also, if the aggregate principal balance of our portfolio grows but the number of our loans or the number of our borrowers does not grow, we could face increased risk by reason of the concentration of our investments.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 44 loans held for investment, excluding 76 loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $1.7 billion and outstanding principal was $1.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we funded approximately $544.2 million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $746.8 million of outstanding principal. As of December 31, 2018, 89.8% of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) floors, with a weighted average floor of 1.38%, calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or L\u201d are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated).\nOther than as set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2018, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment.\nOur loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of December 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Amount (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Principal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Remaining Life (Years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior mortgage loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,489,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,498,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments\n</td> <td>35,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans held for investment portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,534,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. \n (2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. \n (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of December 31, 2018 as weighted by the outstanding principal balance of each loan. \nNon-Controlling Interests\nThe non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC ( ACRC KA\u201d) that are not owned by us. In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding. See Notes 6 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about ACRC KA.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policy represents an area where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Loans Held for Investment. We originate CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held for investment. Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, unless the loans are deemed impaired. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we will record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different.\nEach loan classified as held for investment is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans are generally collateralized by real estate or the equity of the real estate owner. The extent of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property and the financial and operating capability of the borrower could impact the expected amounts received.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, which describes recent accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or are currently evaluating.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn January 11, 2019, ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2017-FL3 Ltd. (the Issuer\u201d) and ACRE Commercial Mortgage\n2017-FL3 LLC (the Co-Issuer\u201d), both wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of ours, entered into an Amended and Restated Indenture (the Amended Indenture\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as advancing agent and note administrator, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, which governs the approximately $504.1 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes issued by the Issuer and $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer (the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization\u201d). The Amended Indenture amends and restates, and replaces in its entirety, the indenture for the CLO Securitization issued in March 2017, which governed the issuance of approximately $308.8 million principal balance of secured floating rate notes and $32.4 million of preferred equity in the Issuer. After giving effect to the 2019 FL3 CLO Securitization, we retained (through one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries) approximately $58.5 million of the non-investment grade notes and all of the $52.9 million of preferred equity in the Issuer, which notes and preferred equity were not offered to investors. The secured floating rate notes are collateralized by interests in a pool of 17 mortgage assets having an aggregate principal balance of $557.0 million.\nOn February 6, 2019, we originated and fully funded a $30.0 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in North Carolina. The loan has a per annum interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 3.15% (plus fees) and an initial term of three years.\nOn February 14, 2019, we originated a $100.6 million senior mortgage loan on a mixed-use property located in Florida.

The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the UBS Facility and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined below and collectively, the Secured Funding Agreements\u201d) and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan (as defined below) were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earnings assets and weighted average borrowings as well as an increase in 30-day LIBOR for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net interest margin was approximately $46.3 million and $45.1 million, respectively.

As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in incentive fees due to our Manager, an increase in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $15.0 million and $14.4 million, respectively. As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees and general and administrative expenses due to our Manager that were allocated to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and partially offset by a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nRelated Party Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses included $7.4 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.3 million in management fees and $1.2 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, related party expenses also included $3.6 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. The management fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in incentive fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Core Earnings\u201d is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of our target investments are structured as debt and we foreclose on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. The decrease in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in the percentage of time allocated to us by employees of our Manager due to changes in transaction activity year over year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses included $6.6 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $6.2 million in management fees and $0.4 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $3.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses included $6.0 million in management and incentive fees due to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, which consisted of $5.6 million in management fees and $0.3 million in incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, related party expenses also included $3.4 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager\npursuant to the Management Agreement. The increase in management fees due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees that were allocated to continuing operations subsequent to the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale on September 30, 2016. The incentive fees due to our Manager were relatively consistent for both periods. The increase in general and administrative expenses due to our Manager for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in general and administrative expenses that were allocated to continuing operations as employees of our Manager allocated a significant percentage of their time during the year ended December 31, 2016 to discontinued operations for due diligence work associated with the closing of the ACRE Capital Sale.\nOther Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, professional fees were $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, general and administrative expenses were $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to new restricted stock grants awarded after December 31, 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, professional fees were $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, general and administrative expenses were $2.8 million.\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt Costs\nIn December 2017, we voluntarily elected to repay $45.0 million of outstanding principal on our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) prior to the scheduled maturity as permitted by the contractual terms of the Secured Term Loan. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred early extinguishment of debt costs of $0.8 million, which was a non-cash charge incurred in connection with the $45.0 million repayment of outstanding principal on the Secured Term Loan. The early extinguishment of debt costs was comprised of the pro-rata share of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discounts being allocated to the outstanding principal that was repaid.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay\nborrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, make principal and interest payments on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our Secured Funding Agreements, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating activities. However, principal repayments from mortgage loans in securitizations where we retain the subordinate securities are applied sequentially, first used to pay down the senior notes, and accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the securitizations until all senior notes are repaid in full. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from the 1940 Act, we expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit, secured funding and other lending facilities, (b) securitizations, (c) other sources of private financing, including warehouse and repurchase facilities, and (d) public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities. We may seek to sell certain of our investments in order to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risk, meet other operating objectives and adapt to market conditions. In instances where we do not have sufficient available liquidity to originate mortgage loans, Ares Management or one of its investment vehicles may originate such mortgage loans and we may have the opportunity to purchase such loans that are determined by our Manager in good faith to be appropriate for us, once we have sufficient available liquidity.\nEquity Offerings\nThere were no shares issued in public offerings of our equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which are inclusive of amounts related to discontinued operations ($ in thousands):\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>39,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>157,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(405,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(214,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,923\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased (decreased) by $(17.3) million, $(18.9) million and $8.3 million, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $39.2 million and $31.3 million, respectively.

This change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily related to the cash used to originate and fund mortgage loans held for sale exceeding the proceeds received from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale to third parties for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan origination fees and costs of $6.6 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.6 million and change in other assets of $2.5 million.

This change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment exceeding the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in investing activities totaled $405.8 million and $60.3 million, respectively. This change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of the cash used for the origination of new loans held for investment exceeding the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities totaled $214.4 million and primarily related to repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $822.2 million and dividends paid of $32.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $642.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $355.6 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $923.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt of consolidated VIEs of $272.9 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $746.6 million, repayments of our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $45.0 million and dividends paid of $30.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $73.1 million and primarily related to proceeds from our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.3 billion, proceeds from our Warehouse Lines of Credit (as defined below) of $863.4 million and proceeds from our Secured Term Loan (as defined below) of $80.0 million, partially offset by repayments of our Secured Funding Agreements of $1.0 billion, repayments of debt of consolidated VIEs of $255.3 million, repayments of our Warehouse Lines of Credit of $795.7 million and dividends paid of $29.4 million.\nWe, through our previously owned subsidiary, ACRE Capital, borrowed funds under the ASAP Line of Credit and the BAML Line of Credit (individually defined below and together, the Warehouse Lines of Credit\u201d). ACRE Capital was party to an $80.0 million multifamily as soon as pooled sale agreement (the ASAP Line of Credit\u201d) with the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) to finance installments received from Fannie Mae. ACRE Capital was party to a $135.0 million line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended and restated, the BAML Line of Credit\u201d), which was used to finance mortgage loans originated by ACRE Capital.\nSummary of Financing Agreements\nThe sources of financing, as applicable

master repurchase funding facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Wells Fargo Facility\u201d) is subject to three 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In December 2018, we amended the Wells Fargo Facility to extend the initial maturity date to December 14, 2020 and decrease the interest rate on advances to a per annum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25%. \n (2) The maturity date of the master repurchase facility with Citibank, N.A. (the Citibank Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. As of December 31, 2017, the Citibank Facility had an accordion feature that provided for an increase in the $250.0 million commitment amount with respect to approved assets, as determined by Citibank, N.A. in its sole discretion. In December 2018, we amended the Citibank Facility to increase the facility's commitment amount from $250.0 million to $325.0 million, extend the initial maturity date to December 13, 2021, decrease the interest rate on advances to a per \nannum rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus an indicative pricing margin range of 1.50% to 2.25% and remove the accordion feature.\n (3) Individual advances on loans under the Bridge Loan Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the BAML Facility\u201d) generally have a two-year maturity, subject to a 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In May 2018, we amended the BAML Facility to extend the period during which we may request individual loans under the facility to May 23, 2019. In addition, the final maturity date of individual loans under the BAML Facility was extended to May 23, 2022. \n (4) The maturity date of the secured revolving funding facility with City National Bank (the CNB Facility\u201d) is subject to one 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. In February 2018, we exercised a 12-month extension option on the CNB Facility to extend the maturity date to March 10, 2019. \n (5) The maturity date of the revolving master repurchase facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the MetLife Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. \n (6) The interest rate on advances under the revolving master repurchase facility with UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (the UBS Facility\u201d) was the sum of one-month LIBOR plus (i) 1.88% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance for one year or less, (ii) 2.08% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance in excess of one year but less than two years, and (iii) 2.28% per annum, for assets that were subject to an advance for more than two years. In October 2018, the UBS Facility matured. The UBS Facility had been repaid in full and its term was not extended. \n (7) The maturity date of the master repurchase and securities contract with U.S. Bank National Association (the U.S. Bank Facility\u201d) is subject to two 12-month extensions at our option provided that certain conditions are met and applicable extension fees are paid. \n (8) The maturity date of the Credit and Guaranty Agreement with the lenders referred to therein and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders (the Secured Term Loan\u201d), is subject to one 12-month extension at our option provided that certain conditions are met. \nOur Financing Agreements contain various affirmative and negative covenants, including negative pledges, and provisions related to events of default that are normal and customary for similar financing agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of each respective Financing Agreement. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our Financing Agreements.\nSecuritizations\nWe may seek to enhance the returns on our senior mortgage loan investments through securitizations, if available. To the extent available, we intend to securitize the senior portion of some of our loans, while retaining the subordinate securities in our investment portfolio. The securitization of this senior portion will be accounted for as either a sale\u201d and the loans will be removed from our balance sheet or as a financing\u201d and will be classified as loans held for investment\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets, depending upon the structure of the securitization. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying amount and outstanding principal of our CLO Securitization was $270.7 million and $272.9 million, respectively. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of our CLO Securitization. See Recent Developments\u201d and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a subsequent event related to the CLO Securitization.\nCapital Markets\nWe may periodically raise additional capital through public offerings of debt and equity securities to fund new investments. On June 6, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), which became effective on August 29, 2016, in order to permit us to offer, from time to time, in one or more offerings or series of offerings up to $1.25 billion of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase shares of our common stock, warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, or units.\nOther Sources of Financing\nIn addition to the sources of liquidity described above, in the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments or to refinance expiring Financing Agreements and securitizations, including other credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities, non-convertible or convertible debt, securitized\nfinancings and other public and private forms of borrowing. These financings may be issued by us or our subsidiaries, be collateralized or non-collateralized, accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates and may involve one or more lenders.\nLeverage Policies\nWe intend to use prudent amounts of leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. To that end, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we intend to continue to use borrowings to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments. Given current market conditions and our focus on first or senior mortgages, we currently expect that such leverage would not exceed, on a debt-to-equity basis, a 4-to-1 ratio. Our charter and bylaws do not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use. The amount of leverage we will deploy for particular investments in our target investments will depend upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic regions and commercial mortgage markets, our outlook for the level and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are described in the following table ($ in thousands):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Facility\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Citibank Facility\n</td> <td>184,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BAML Facility\n</td> <td>36,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CNB Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Facility\n</td> <td>135,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Bank Facility\n</td> <td>148,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Term Loan\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future Loan Funding Commitments\n</td> <td>142,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above does not include the related interest expense under the Secured Funding Agreements and the Secured Term Loan, as all our interest is variable. Additionally, the table above does not include extension options, as applicable, under the Secured Funding Agreements.\nWe may enter into certain contracts that may contain a variety of indemnification obligations, principally with underwriters and counterparties to repurchase agreements. The maximum potential future payment amount we could be required to pay under these indemnification obligations may be unlimited.\nManagement Agreement\nWe are also required to pay our Manager a base management fee of 1.5% of our stockholders' equity per year, an incentive fee and expense reimbursements pursuant to our Management Agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our Management Agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our Management Agreement.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate annually distributing to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at\nregular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if a REIT distributes less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to its stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then it is required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if a REIT elects to retain any of its net capital gain for any tax year, it must notify its stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain) will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.\nBefore we make any distributions, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our Financing Agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our REIT taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have commitments to fund various senior mortgage loans, as well as subordinated debt and preferred equity investments in our portfolio.\nOther than as set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, special purpose"}
