Business-Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10K\u201d) contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis used in the computation of the net interest margin and efficiency ratio. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10K because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company's financial position reflected in the results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.\nTangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures)\nTangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create tangible equity\u201d facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations. The Company's management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible shareholder's equity for the periods presented.\nReconciliation to Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other intangible assets (goodwill) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tangible common shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures)\nIn accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio. The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 21% effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 34% effective tax rate for 2017, allows comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company's overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.\nReconciliation of Annualized Net Interest Margin, Fully Tax Equivalent (non-GAAP)\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax equivalent adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income - tax equivalent adjusted (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average earning assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>650,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure - Efficiency Ratio\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax equivalent adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income - tax-equivalent adjusted (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,049 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Efficiency ratio, fully tax-equivalent (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2019 of $5,500,000, an increase of $600,000 (12.2%) from $4,900,000 in 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $0.94 for 2019 and $0.83 for 2018. For 2019, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.92% and a return on average assets of 0.78%, compared to 6.77% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2018.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income for 2018 increased $1,702,000 (53.2%) from $3,198,000 in 2017. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $0.50. For 2017, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.91% and return on average assets of 0.49%.

At December 31, 2019, net loans totaled $393,802,000, an increase of $75,286,000 (23.6%) from the ending balance of $318,516,000 at December 31, 2018. Deposits increased $14,163,000 or 2.4% from $590,674,000 at December 31, 2018 to $604,837,000 at December 31, 2019. Shareholders' equity increased $8,188,000 or 11.0% from $74,721,000 at December 31, 2018 to $82,909,000 at December 31, 2019. The Company ended 2019 with a leverage capital ratio of 9.2% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.9% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 8.9% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.3% at the end of 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% in 2019, 3.41% in 2018, and 3.39% in 2017. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $2,570,000 (12.3%), from $20,853,000 in 2018 to $23,423,000 in 2019. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $1,110,000 (5.6%), from $19,743,000 in 2017 to $20,853,000 in 2018.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $3,435,000 (15.3%) from $22,449,000 in 2018 to $25,884,000 in 2019. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,335,000) and volume (up $2,100,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.72% in 2018 to 4.95% in 2019 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.66% in 2018 to 2.81% in 2019. The increased yield in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.67% during 2018 to 3.98% during 2019. The volume increase of $2,100,000 was primarily from an increase in loans ($2,394,000) and interest-bearing deposits in banks ($153,000), partially offset by a decrease in investment balances ($103,000) and Federal funds ($345,000). Average loans balances increased $50,964,000, (or 16.5%), from $308,365,000 during 2018 to $359,329,000 during 2019, average interest-bearing deposits in banks increased $168,000, (or 509.1%), from $33,000 during 2018 to $201,000 during 2019 average investment balances decreased $1,602,000, (or 0.6%), from $282,898,000 during 2018 to $281,296,000 in 2019, and average Federal funds decreased $18,515,000, (or 99.1%), from $18,688,000 during 2018 to $173,000 in 2019.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,645,000 (7.9%) from $20,804,000 in 2017 to $22,449,000 in 2018. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,764,000) and volume (down $119,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.57% in 2017 to 4.72% in 2018 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.36% in 2017 to 2.66% in 2018. The increased yield in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.57% during 2017 to 3.67% during 2018. The increase in yield from the loans and investments was partially offset by an increase in the balances of Federal funds sold. Federal funds sold balances increased from zero in 2017 to an average balance of $18,688,000 in 2018. However, the yield on these lower earning Federal fund balances was 1.86%, thus partially reducing the overall yield on earning assets. The volume decrease of $119,000 was primarily from a decrease in loans ($515,000), partially offset by an increase in investment balances ($391,000). Average loans balances decreased $11,266,000, (or 3.5%), from $319,631,000 during 2017 to $308,365,000 during 2018 and the average investment balances increased $21,344,000, (or 8.2%), from $261,554,000 during 2017 to $282,898,000 in 2018.\nInterest expense was $865,000 (or 54.2%) higher in 2019 compared to 2018, increasing from $1,596,000 to $2,461,000. The $865,000 increase in interest expense during 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher rates (up $745,000) and higher volume (up $120,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 22 basis points from 0.41% to 0.63% for 2018 compared to 2019. The largest increase due to rates occurred in interest checking and money market accounts and in the time deposits. The rate paid on interest checking and money market accounts increased from 0.14% during 2018 to 0.34% during 2019 and accounted for $300,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The rate paid on time deposit accounts increased from 1.86% during 2018 to 2.89% during 2019 and accounted for $342,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The volume increase of $120,000 was attributed to an increase in average time deposit balances which increased from $79,422,000 during 2018 to $85,723,000 during 2019 and accounted for $84,000 of the $120,000 increase and an increase in average other borrowings which increased from $15,533,000 during 2018 to $18,430,000 during 2019 and accounted for $44,000 of the $120,000 increase.\nInterest expense was $535,000 (or 50.4%) higher in 2018 compared to 2017, increasing from $1,061,000 to $1,596,000. The $535,000 increase in interest expense during 2018 compared to 2017 was due to higher rates (up $531,000) and higher volume (up $4,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points from 0.30% to 0.41% for 2017 compared to 2018. The largest increase due to rates occurred in the time deposits. Some of these time deposits are indexed to the three- or six-month treasury rates which have increased over the past twelve months. Interest expense on time deposits increased by $367,000, (or 52.9%), from $694,000 in 2017 to $1,061,000 in 2018 while the average time deposit balances decreased by $1,634,000, (or 2.0%), from $81,056,000 in 2017 to $79,422,000 in 2018.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses.

The Company experienced net loan and lease losses of $261,000 or 0.08% of average loans and leases during 2018, compared to net loan and lease losses of $794,000 or 0.25% of average loans and leases during 2017. To support the net losses in 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded provisions for loan and lease losses of $175,000 and $450,000, respectively during 2018 and 2017. The level of nonperforming loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to zero at December 31, 2019.

The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily related to higher gains on sale of securities which increased $84,000 (271.0%) from 2018 to 2019 and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts which increased $82,000 (17.2%) from $476,000 in 2018 to $558,000 in 2019.\nNoninterest income decreased $83,000 (5.2%) to $1,513,000 in 2018 from $1,596,000 in 2017. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily related to lower gains on sale of securities. Gain on sales of securities decreased $130,000 (81.3%) from 2017 to 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $11,316,000 (up $1,113,000 or 10.9%) for 2019, compared to $10,203,000 in 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from a full year of salary and benefits for new hires in 2018 including additional relationship managers and lending support personnel, as well as, increased incentive payments to the relationship managers due to the increased loan production in 2019. Salary expense in 2019 also includes normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 102 during 2019 compared to 97 during 2018. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\nSalaries and benefits were $10,203,000 (up $1,283,000 or 14.4%) for 2018, compared to $8,920,000 in 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from filling some vacant positions, hiring additional relationship managers, creating a position for a Chief Lending Officer in December 2017, and normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 97 during 2018 compared to 93 during 2017. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2019 was $134,000 (up $114,000 or 570.0%) compared to $20,000 in 2018. The primary reason for the increase in OREO related expense was due to the $111,000 write-down of the Company's lone remaining property in 2019 after receipt of an updated property valuation report. Operating expenses on the properties in 2019 totaled $23,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. Write-downs on the property totaled $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company held one property with a book value of $846,000.\nThe total OREO expense in 2018 was $20,000 (down $24,000 or 54.5%) compared to $44,000 in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses was due to the sale of one of the properties in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2017 totaled $52,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. In 2017, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were $8,000 compared to zero in 2018. There were no write-downs on any of the properties held during 2017 compared to write-downs of $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company held one property with a book value of $957,000.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $27,000 (2.6%) during 2019 to $1,023,000, compared to $1,050,000 in 2018. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $11,000 (2.0%) during 2019 to $542,000 compared to $553,000 in 2018. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nOccupancy expense decreased $3,000 (0.3%) during 2018 to $1,050,000, compared to $1,053,000 in 2017. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $33,000 (5.6%) during 2018 to $553,000 compared to $586,000 in 2017. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $154,000 (76.2%) during 2019 to $48,000, compared to $202,000 in 2018. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2019 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $78,000 in 2018. The decrease in FDIC assessments in 2019 is due to the receipt of the FDIC's Small Bank Assessment Credits during the year as the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio exceeded 1.35%.\nFDIC assessments decreased $4,000 (1.9%) during 2018 to $202,000, compared to $206,000 in 2017. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2018 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $74,000 in 2017.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outsourced item processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors' expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telephone and postage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>39 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expenses were $3,705,000 (up $301,000 or 8.8%) for 2019, compared to $3,404,000 for 2018. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional fees (up $68,000) and bank charges (up $233,000) (which is included in the other operating expenses line item). The increase in professional expenses is related to more services being provided by the Company's network administrator. The higher bank charges relate to lower average balances maintained by the Company in these accounts in 2019 resulting in higher service charges and the interest earned on these balances began to increase in 2018 due to the higher interest rate environment and continued into 2019, as a result, in 2019 the Company began being recording this as interest income on deposits held in other banks. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in telephone expense which decreased $91,000 (26.6%) from $342,000 in 2018 to $251,000 in 2019 and relates to the Company converted to a more cost-effective telephone system. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2019 was 67.1% compared to 69.4% in 2018.\nOther expenses were $3,404,000 (up $238,000 or 7.5%) for 2018, compared to $3,166,000 for 2017. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the advertising and promotion expense category. Advertising and promotion expense increased $333,000 (146.1%), from $228,000 in 2017 to $561,000 in 2018. Much of this increase is related to the expenses to sponsor community events and other promotional activities as the Company is focusing more effort in our markets to strengthen our brand. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2018 was 69.4% compared to 65.8% in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.6%, 24.3%, and 50.4% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $610,000, $523,000, and $420,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,361,000, $1,315,000, and $1,471,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared 2018 is related to the tax treatment of equity based compensation under Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). Under ASU 2016-09, if the market value of the Company's stock price on the date restricted stock vests is higher than the Company's stock price on the date the restricted stock was awarded the Company receives a tax credit for the difference in values and if the market price on the vesting date is lower than the stock price on the award date the Company recognizes additional tax expense. During 2018, the Company recognized a $166,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09 and in 2019 the Company recognized a $34,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09.\nThe lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 results from the lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, which was a reduction from the Company's 2017 rate of 34%. The high effective tax rate in 2017 resulted from the Company recording an income tax expense adjustment of $1,220,000 related to H.R.1\u201d commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The adjustment relates to revaluing the Company's net deferred tax assets using the new lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company's taxable income in 2018 was $6,474,000 up slightly from $6,450,000 in 2017, however, the combined federal and State income tax expense decreased $1,678,000 (51.6%) from $3,252,000 in 2017 to $1,574,000 in 2018. Excluding the $1,220,000 adjustment related to H.R.1, the tax expense would have been $2,032,000 in 2017. Comparing the actual expense of $1,574,000 in 2018 to the adjusted expense of $2,032,000 in 2017 points out the benefit of the lower 21% federal tax rate.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $720,353,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $688,092,000 at December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $32,261,000 (4.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2019 were $703,205,000, up $21,575,000 or 3.2% from the 2018 average balances of total assets of $681,630,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement asset/liability management strategies as part of our contingency funding plan and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors. Table Six below summarizes the values of the Company's investment securities held on December 31 of the years indicated. The Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading in any of the years indicated below.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable Six: Investment Securities Composition\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>Available-for-sale (at fair value) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>US Government Agencies and US Government-Sponsored Agencies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>232,869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Obligations of states and political subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,715 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.

Management periodically evaluates each investment security in a loss position for other than temporary impairment relying primarily on industry analyst reports, observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations. Management has the ability and intent to hold securities with established maturity dates until recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity, and believes it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms for all of the underlying investment securities; therefore, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. See Table Fifteen, Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields,\u201d for a breakdown of the investment securities by maturity and the corresponding weighted average yields.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company concentrates its lending activities in the following principal areas: (1) commercial; (2) commercial real estate; (3) multi-family real estate; (4) real estate construction (both commercial and residential); (5) residential real estate; (6) lease financing receivable; (7) agriculture; and (8) consumer loans. At December 31, 2019, these categories accounted for approximately 11%, 54%, 14%, 6%, 7%, 0%, 2% and 6%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio compared to approximately 9%, 62%, 18%, 2%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 3%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Also, as noted in Table 7 below, the Company's primary focus is commercial and real estate loans, however, in 2018 the Company was selected by a lender that specializes in classic and collector cars. The company began purchasing loans from this lender during the third quarter of 2018 and recorded $10,791,000 during 2018 and $20,960,000 during 2019 and accounts for the increase in consumer loans.\nContinuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, an upgraded lending team in 2018, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $149 million in loans in 2019 and $104 million in 2018 compared to $30 million in 2017. This production was offset by normal pay downs and payoffs, and resulted in an overall net increase in net loans and leases of $75.3 million (23.6%) from December 31, 2018. The market in which the Company operates has shown increased demand for credit products as the relatively low rate environment and expectations for economic expansion have increased refinancing as well as new loan activity.

The Company relies substantially on networking, local promotional activity, and personal contacts by American River Bank officers, directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions. The Company makes loans and leases to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose and a viable primary repayment source, generally supported by a secondary source of repayment.\nCommercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs, loans for equipment purchases, working capital, and various other business loan products. Consumer loans include a range of traditional consumer loan products such as personal lines of credit and homeowner equity lines of credit and loans to finance purchases of autos (including classic and collector's autos), boats, recreational vehicles, mobile homes and various other consumer items. Construction loans are generally comprised of commitments to customers within the Company's service area for construction of commercial properties, multi-family properties and custom and semi-custom single-family residences. Other real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by first trust deeds on commercial, multi-family, and residential properties typically with maturities from 3 to 10 years and original loan-to-value ratios generally from 65% to 75%. Agriculture loans consist primarily of loans secured by real property. In general, except in the case of loans under SBA programs or Farm Services Agency guarantees, the Company does not make long-term mortgage loans.\nAverage loans and leases in 2019 were $359,329,000, which represents an increase of $50,964,000 (16.5%) compared to the average in 2018. Average loans and leases in 2018 were $308,365,000, which represents a decrease of $11,266,000 (3.5%) compared to the $319,631,000 average balance in 2017.\nRisk Elements\nThe Company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality, extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies. Additionally, the Company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio. Management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the Company's loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth. Management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process, through active credit administration and regular monitoring. With this in mind, management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.\nUltimately, underlying trends in economic and business cycles influence credit quality. American River Bank's business is concentrated in the Sacramento Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a diversified economy, but with a large State of California government presence and employment base; in Sonoma County, which is focused on businesses within the two communities in which the Bank has offices (Santa Rosa and Healdsburg); and in Amador County, in which the Bank is primarily focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices (Jackson, Pioneer, and Ione). The economy of Sonoma County is diversified with professional services, manufacturing, agriculture and real estate investment and construction, while the economy of Amador County is reliant upon government, services, retail trade, manufacturing industries and Indian gaming.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate. The ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate. The Company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans. The more significant factors management considers involve the following: lease rates and terms, vacancy rates, absorption and sale rates and capitalization rates; real estate values, supply and demand factors, and rates of return; operating expenses; inflation and deflation; and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including, in some instances, personal guarantees.\nIn extending credit and commitments to borrowers, the Company generally requires collateral and/or guarantees as security. The repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flows or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. The Company's requirement for collateral and/or guarantees is determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with management's evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing properties, residences and other real property. The Company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets, obtaining deeds of trust, or outright possession among other means.\nIn management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately 81% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 87% at December 31, 2018. Management believes that the residential land portion of the Company's loan portfolio carries a reasonable level of credit risk. As of December 31, 2019, outstanding unimproved residential land commitments were $6,184,000 (or just 1.9% of the total real estate loans). Of the $6,184,000, $1,997,000 (32%) was represented by one amortizing loan, which was considered well-secured, with a favorable loan-to-value ratio. Management currently believes that it maintains its allowance for loan and lease losses at levels adequate to reflect the loss risk inherent in its total loan portfolio.\nA decline in the economy in general, or decline in real estate values in the Company's market areas, in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of real estate loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. This could adversely affect the Company's future prospects, results of operations, profitability and stock price. Management believes that its lending practices and underwriting standards are structured with the intent to minimize losses; however, there is no assurance that losses will not occur. The Company's loan practices and underwriting standards include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) maintaining a thorough understanding of the Company's market area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area, (2) maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers' knowledge, capacity, and market position in their field of expertise, (3) basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project, but also on the borrowers' capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations (whether sale or income performance), and (4) maintaining conforming and prudent loan-to-value and loan-to-cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the Company's lending officers or contracted third-party professionals.\nNonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases\nManagement places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or if a loss is expected, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases are partially or fully charged off when, in the opinion of management, collection of such amount appears unlikely.\nThe recorded investments in nonperforming loans and leases, which includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases that were 90 days or more past due and on accrual, totaled zero and $27,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $27,000 in nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2018 were comprised of one commercial loan relationship with two loans totaling $27,000, both of which were current to terms. At December 31, 2019 there were two loans totaling $75,000 30 days or more past due compared to no loans that were 30 days or more past due December 31, 2018.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructured loans considered performing and accruing at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $5,970,000, $6,626,000, $6,799,000, $7,975,000, and $8,062,000, respectively.

There were no loan or lease concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans and leases not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases as of December 31, 2019. Management is not aware of any potential problem loans, which were accruing and current at December 31, 2019, where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms and that would result in a significant loss to the Company apart from those loans identified in the Bank's impairment analysis.\nManagement monitors the Company's performance metrics including the ratios related to nonperforming loans and leases. From 2008 to 2010, the Company experienced an increase in nonperforming loans and leases. In 2011, the focused efforts of the previous years resulted in a decrease in these levels. From 2012 to 2019, the level of nonperforming loans and leases continued to decrease to a level below the amount reported at December 31, 2008. However, the variations in the amount of nonperforming loans and leases does not directly impact the level of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses as management monitors each of the loans and leases for loss potential or probability of loss on an individual basis using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nImpaired Loans and Leases\nThe Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. The measurement of impairment may be based on (i) the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or lease discounted at the loan's or lease's original effective interest rate, (ii) the observable market price of the impaired loan or lease, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral-dependent loan. The Company does not apply this definition to smaller-balance loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for credit risk. In assessing whether a loan or lease is impaired, the Company typically reviews loans or leases graded substandard or lower with outstanding principal balances in excess of $100,000, as well as loans considered troubled debt restructures with outstanding principal balances in excess of $25,000. The Company identifies troubled debt restructures by reviewing each renewal, modification, or extension of a loan with a screening document. This document is designed to identify any characteristics of such a loan that would qualify it as a troubled debt restructure. If the characteristics are not present that would qualify a loan as a troubled debt restructure, it is deemed to be a modification.\nThe recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $7,604,000 at December 31, 2019 and had a related valuation allowance of $142,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2019 was approximately $7,845,000. As of December 31, 2018, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $8,702,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $185,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2018 was approximately $8,847,000. As of December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $13,757,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $355,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2017 was approximately $14,046,000.\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, which is based upon management's estimate of those losses. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge-offs. Actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process. The model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management's judgment after consideration of numerous factors including, but not limited to: (i) local and regional economic conditions, (ii) the financial condition of the borrowers, (iii) loan impairment and the related level of expected charge-offs, (iv) evaluation of industry trends, (v) industry and other concentrations, (vi) loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management, (vii) continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio, (viii) ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential, (ix) quarterly review by the Board of Directors, and (x) assessments by banking regulators and other third parties. Management and the Board of Directors evaluate the ALLL and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures, such as knowledge of the borrower's business, valuation of collateral, the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses.\nThe ALLL totaled $5,138,000 or 1.29% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2019, $4,392,000 or 1.36% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018, and $4,478,000 or 1.43% at December 31, 2017. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses from $4,392,000 at December 31, 2018 to $5,138,000 at December 31, 2019, was mainly due to the increase in loans outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company establishes general and specific reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The ALLL is composed of categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating; however, the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses. While management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on changes in economic conditions and other matters. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's ALLL. Such agencies may require the Company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of impaired loans and leases was 67.6% at December 31, 2019 and 50.5% at December 31, 2018. Of the total nonperforming and impaired loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2019, there were $794,000 in loans or leases that had been reduced by partial charge-offs of $292,000.\nAt December 31, 2019, there was $5,848,000 in impaired loans or leases that did not carry a specific reserve. Of this amount, $477,000 were loans or leases that had previous partial charge-offs and $5,371,000 were loans or leases that were analyzed and determined not to require a specific reserve or charge-off because the collateral value or discounted cash flow value exceeded the loan or lease balance. Prior to 2013, the Company had been operating in a market that had experienced significant decreases in real estate values of commercial, residential, land, and construction properties. As such, the Company continues to focus on monitoring collateral values for those loans considered collateral dependent. The collateral evaluations performed by the Company are updated as necessary, which is generally once every twelve months, and are reviewed by a qualified credit officer.\nThe Company's policy with regard to loan or lease charge-offs continues to be that a loan or lease is charged off against the ALLL when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. As previously discussed in the Impaired Loans and Leases\u201d section, certain loans are evaluated for impairment. Generally, if a loan is collateralized by real estate, and considered collateral dependent, the impaired portion will be charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses unless it is in the process of collection, in which case a specific reserve may be warranted. If the collateral is other than real estate and considered impaired, a specific reserve may be warranted.\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Formula allocations are calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Historical loss factors are based upon the Company's loss experience. These historical loss factors are adjusted for changes in the business cycle and for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. The discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is prudent and adequate. However, no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty.

through foreclosure. During 2018, the Company received an updated appraisal on the one property and reduced the balance by $4,000 through a charge to OREO expense. During 2019, the Company received an updated appraisal on the one property and reduced the balance by an additional $111,000 through a charge to OREO expense. During 2019, the Company did not acquire any OREO properties. There was $846,000 in OREO at December 31, 2019 with no valuation allowance and $957,000 in OREO at December 31, 2018 with no valuation allowance. During 2019, the Company took possession of an automobile formerly held as collateral on a loan. The book value of the automobile at December 31, 2019 was $517,000. Other than the $517,000 automobile, there were no other asset repossessed during 2019 or 2018.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $604,837,000 representing an increase of $14,163,000 (2.4%) from the December 31, 2018 balance of $590,674,000. The Company's deposit growth plan for 2019 was to concentrate its efforts on increasing noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing money market and interest-bearing checking, and savings accounts, while continuing to focus on reducing overall interest expense. Due to these efforts, the Company experienced an increase in non-time deposits (CD's) balances of $28,441,000 (5.7%) from $502,587,000 at December 31, 2018 to $531,028,000 at December 31, 2019. During 2019 the Company had increased balances in noninterest-bearing checking ($12,310,000 or 5.7%), money market ($12,488,000 or 8.6%), savings ($3,298,000 or 4.5%), and interest checking ($345,000 or 0.5%) and a decrease in time deposit ($14,278,000 or 16.2%).\nTable 225: <table><tr><td>47 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\tOther borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB\u201d).

The Company's capital position represents the level of capital available to support continuing operations and expansion.\nOn January 24, 2018, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2018 (the 2018 Program\u201d). The 2018 Program authorized the repurchase during 2018 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. During 2018, the Company repurchased 308,618 shares of its common stock at an average price of $15.52 per share. The Company did not have a repurchase program in 2019 and therefore did not repurchase any shares in 2019.\nThe Company repurchased 575,389 shares in 2012, 849,404 shares in 2013, 424,462 in 2014, 790,989 shares in 2015, 716,897 shares in 2016, and 574,748 shares in 2017. Share amounts have been adjusted for stock dividends and/or splits. See Part II, Item 5, \t Stock Repurchases\u201d for more information regarding stock repurchases.\nThe Company and American River Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and American River Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the most recent regulatory notification categorized American River Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's categories.\nTable 229: <table><tr><td>48 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, shareholders' equity was $82,909,000, representing an increase of $8,188,000 (11.0%) from $74,721,000 at December 31, 2018. The increase in 2019 resulted from additions of net income of $5,500,000, the increase in the unrealized gain on securities due to a decrease in interest rates of $3,668,000, and stock based compensation of $433,000 exceeding the payment of cash dividends of $1,413,000. In 2018, shareholders' equity decreased $2,200,000 (2.9%) from $76,921,000 at December 31, 2017. The decrease in 2018 resulted from repurchases of common stock of $4,773,000, the payment of cash dividends of $1,188,000, and a decrease in other comprehensive income of $1,555,000, as a result of the decrease in the unrealized gain on securities due to an increase in interest rates, exceeding the additions from net income of $4,900,000 for the period and the stock based compensation of $416,000.\nTable Eleven below lists the Company's and American River Bank's actual capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as the minimum capital ratios for capital adequacy for American River Bank.

The 2.5% buffer increases the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The buffer requirement was phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.\nMarket Risk Management\nOverview. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan, investment and deposit functions. The goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the Company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the Company to undue interest rate risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies. The Company has an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, made up of Company management that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates.\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>49 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset/Liability Management. Activities involved in asset/liability management include but are not limited to lending, accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset/liability management. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates. The asset/liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments. The Company uses simulation models to forecast earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity.\nSimulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes. Using computer-modeling techniques, with specialized software built for this specific purpose for financial institutions, the Company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity. A balance sheet is prepared using detailed inputs of actual loans, securities and interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. deposits/borrowings). The balance sheet is processed using multiple interest rate scenarios. The scenarios include a rising rate forecast, a flat rate forecast and a falling rate forecast which take place within a one-year time frame. The net interest income is measured over one-year and two-year periods assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve-month horizon. The simulation modeling attempts to estimate changes in the Company's net interest income utilizing a detailed current balance sheet. Table Twelve below summarizes the effect on net interest income (NII) of a \u00b1100 and \u00b1200 basis point change in interest rates as measured against a constant rate (no change) scenario.\nTable Twelve: Interest Rate Risk Simulation of Net Interest as of December 31, 2019\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change in NII\nfrom Current\n12 Month Horizon </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change in NII\nfrom Current\n24 Month Horizon </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Variation from a constant rate scenario </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+100bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>+200bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,097 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>-100bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(318 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,411 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>-200bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(788 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,642 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAfter a review of the model results as of December 31, 2019, the Company does not consider the fluctuations from the base case, to have a material impact on the Company's projected results and are within the tolerance levels outlined in the Company's interest rate risk polices. The simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions, which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations. Therefore, they do not reflect likely actual results, but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing or maturity. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons. The differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps. A positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position. An asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to expand. This results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time. Conversely, a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect. A negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position. A liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to contract, while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect.\nTable 235: <table><tr><td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing, or other commercial concerns, primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary. In general, inflation primarily affects the Company through its effect on market rates of interest, which affects the Company's ability to attract loan customers. Inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand, and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future. In addition to its effects on interest rates, inflation increases overall operating expenses. Inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients. Both assets and liabilities contribute to the Company's liquidity position. Federal funds lines, short-term investments and securities, and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity, along with deposit increases, while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity. The Company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns, current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs. Commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2019 were approximately $40,324,000 and $300,000, respectively. Such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe Company's sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks, overnight funds sold to correspondent banks, unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale. On December 31, 2019, consolidated liquid assets totaled $141.5 million or 19.6% of total assets compared to $226.5 million or 32.9% of total assets on December 31, 2018. In addition to liquid assets, the Company maintains short-term lines of credit in the amount of $17,000,000 with two of its correspondent banks. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $17,000,000 available under these credit lines. Additionally, American River Bank is a member of the FHLB. At December 31, 2019, American River Bank could have arranged for up to $162,306,000 in secured borrowings from the FHLB. These borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $143,406,000 available under these secured borrowing arrangements. American River Bank also has a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank. The borrowing can be secured by pledging selected loans and investment securities. Based on the amount of assets pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2019, the Company's borrowing capacity was $8,642,000.\nThe Company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and, as such, its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations. Accordingly, management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits.\nLiquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities. The Company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available-for-sale category to meet liquidity needs. These securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise. American River Bank can also pledge additional securities to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB.\nTable 237: <table><tr><td>51 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in Table Thirteen below for the period presented.

The carrying amount, maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the Company's investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios are presented in Table Fifteen below. The yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis. Yields may not represent actual future income to be recorded. Timing of principal prepayments on mortgage-backed securities may increase or decrease depending on market factors and the borrowers' ability to make unscheduled principal payments. Fast prepayments on bonds that were purchased with a premium will result in a lower yield and slower prepayments on premium bonds will result in a higher yield, the opposite would be true for bonds purchased at a discount.

The carrying values of held-to-maturity securities do not include unrealized gains or losses; however, the net unrecognized gains at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $18,000, $14,000 and $26,000, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2019, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options or similar instruments. At origination, real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% to 75%. In addition, the majority of the Company's commitments have variable interest rates. The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td>53 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commitments to extend credit (dollars in thousands): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residences </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate, construction and land development commitments secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other unused commitments, principally commercial loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles ( SPV\u201d) to dispose of problem assets. The SPV is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent corporation goes bankrupt. Under certain circumstances, these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and nonperforming assets. The Company does not use those vehicles or any other structures to dispose of problem assets.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company leases certain facilities at which it conducts its operations. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are noted in Table Sixteen below. Table Sixteen below presents certain of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nTable Sixteen: Contractual Obligations\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>657 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of Deposit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company's Balance Sheet under GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,682 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the table are amounts payable under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, Deferred Fees Plan and salary continuation agreements listed in the Other Long-Term Liabilities\u2026\u201d category.

In issuing the standard, the FASB is responding to criticism that today's guidance delays recognition of credit losses. The standard will replace today's incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize changes to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity's assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 was initially scheduled to become effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, however, on November 15, 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 delaying the effective date for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022; early adoption is still permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). While the Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, including if it will early adopt the standard, it has taken steps to prepare for the implementation when it becomes effective, such as forming an internal task force, gathering pertinent data, consulting with outside professionals, evaluating its current IT systems, and purchasing a software solution. The Company has imported current and historical data into the new software and is currently validating the data and intends to begin processing information, on a test basis, with the new CECL specific software during 2020 and 2021 and to disclose any material potential impact of this modeling once it becomes available.", "summary": "- This financial report presents the consolidated statements of Central Bank of Libya as of and for the three months ended 31 December 2017, which have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and IFRS for banks.\n- The

Business-Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10K\u201d) contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis used in the computation of the net interest margin and efficiency ratio. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10K because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company's financial position reflected in the results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.\nTangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures)\nTangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create tangible equity\u201d facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations. The Company's management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible shareholder's equity for the periods presented.\nReconciliation to Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity:\n\nNet Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures)\nIn accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio. The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 21% effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 34% effective tax rate for 2017, allows comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company's overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.\nReconciliation of Annualized Net Interest Margin, Fully Tax Equivalent (non-GAAP)\n\n 32 \n \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure - Efficiency Ratio\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2019 of $5,500,000, an increase of $600,000 (12.2%) from $4,900,000 in 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $0.94 for 2019 and $0.83 for 2018. For 2019, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.92% and a return on average assets of 0.78%, compared to 6.77% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2018.\n 33 \n \nNet income for 2018 increased $1,702,000 (53.2%) from $3,198,000 in 2017. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $0.50. For 2017, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.91% and return on average assets of 0.49%. Table One below provides a summary of the components of net income for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable One: Components of Net Income\n\n* Fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE)\nDuring 2019, total assets of the Company increased $32,261,000 (4.7%) from $688,092,000 at December 31, 2018 to $720,353,000 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, net loans totaled $393,802,000, an increase of $75,286,000 (23.6%) from the ending balance of $318,516,000 at December 31, 2018. Deposits increased $14,163,000 or 2.4% from $590,674,000 at December 31, 2018 to $604,837,000 at December 31, 2019. Shareholders' equity increased $8,188,000 or 11.0% from $74,721,000 at December 31, 2018 to $82,909,000 at December 31, 2019. The Company ended 2019 with a leverage capital ratio of 9.2% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.9% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 8.9% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.3% at the end of 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% in 2019, 3.41% in 2018, and 3.39% in 2017. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $2,570,000 (12.3%), from $20,853,000 in 2018 to $23,423,000 in 2019. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $1,110,000 (5.6%), from $19,743,000 in 2017 to $20,853,000 in 2018.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $3,435,000 (15.3%) from $22,449,000 in 2018 to $25,884,000 in 2019. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,335,000) and volume (up $2,100,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.72% in 2018 to 4.95% in 2019 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.66% in 2018 to 2.81% in 2019. The increased yield in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.67% during 2018 to 3.98% during 2019. The volume increase of $2,100,000 was primarily from an increase in loans ($2,394,000) and interest-bearing deposits in banks ($153,000), partially offset by a decrease in investment balances ($103,000) and Federal funds ($345,000). Average loans balances increased $50,964,000, (or 16.5%), from $308,365,000 during 2018 to $359,329,000 during 2019, average interest-bearing deposits in banks increased $168,000, (or 509.1%), from $33,000 during 2018 to $201,000 during 2019 average investment balances decreased $1,602,000, (or 0.6%), from $282,898,000 during 2018 to $281,296,000 in 2019, and average Federal funds decreased $18,515,000, (or 99.1%), from $18,688,000 during 2018 to $173,000 in 2019.\n 34 \n \nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,645,000 (7.9%) from $20,804,000 in 2017 to $22,449,000 in 2018. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,764,000) and volume (down $119,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.57% in 2017 to 4.72% in 2018 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.36% in 2017 to 2.66% in 2018. The increased yield in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.57% during 2017 to 3.67% during 2018. The increase in yield from the loans and investments was partially offset by an increase in the balances of Federal funds sold. Federal funds sold balances increased from zero in 2017 to an average balance of $18,688,000 in 2018. However, the yield on these lower earning Federal fund balances was 1.86%, thus partially reducing the overall yield on earning assets. The volume decrease of $119,000 was primarily from a decrease in loans ($515,000), partially offset by an increase in investment balances ($391,000). Average loans balances decreased $11,266,000, (or 3.5%), from $319,631,000 during 2017 to $308,365,000 during 2018 and the average investment balances increased $21,344,000, (or 8.2%), from $261,554,000 during 2017 to $282,898,000 in 2018.\nInterest expense was $865,000 (or 54.2%) higher in 2019 compared to 2018, increasing from $1,596,000 to $2,461,000. The $865,000 increase in interest expense during 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher rates (up $745,000) and higher volume (up $120,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 22 basis points from 0.41% to 0.63% for 2018 compared to 2019. The largest increase due to rates occurred in interest checking and money market accounts and in the time deposits. The rate paid on interest checking and money market accounts increased from 0.14% during 2018 to 0.34% during 2019 and accounted for $300,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The rate paid on time deposit accounts increased from 1.86% during 2018 to 2.89% during 2019 and accounted for $342,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The volume increase of $120,000 was attributed to an increase in average time deposit balances which increased from $79,422,000 during 2018 to $85,723,000 during 2019 and accounted for $84,000 of the $120,000 increase and an increase in average other borrowings which increased from $15,533,000 during 2018 to $18,430,000 during 2019 and accounted for $44,000 of the $120,000 increase.\nInterest expense was $535,000 (or 50.4%) higher in 2018 compared to 2017, increasing from $1,061,000 to $1,596,000. The $535,000 increase in interest expense during 2018 compared to 2017 was due to higher rates (up $531,000) and higher volume (up $4,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points from 0.30% to 0.41% for 2017 compared to 2018. The largest increase due to rates occurred in the time deposits. Some of these time deposits are indexed to the three- or six-month treasury rates which have increased over the past twelve months. Interest expense on time deposits increased by $367,000, (or 52.9%), from $694,000 in 2017 to $1,061,000 in 2018 while the average time deposit balances decreased by $1,634,000, (or 2.0%), from $81,056,000 in 2017 to $79,422,000 in 2018.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses. Table Two provides an analysis of net interest margin on earning assets setting forth average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity; interest income earned and interest expense paid and average rates earned and paid; and the net interest margin on earning assets. Table Three sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume), computed on a daily average basis, and changes in average interest rates.\n 35 \n \nTable Two: Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets\n\n (1) Loan and lease interest includes loan and lease fees of $257,000, $533,000 and $238,000 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (2) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments that primarily relate to income on certain loans and securities that is exempt from federal income taxes. The effective federal statutory tax rate was 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 34% in 2017. \n (3) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets. \n 36 \n \n\n (1) The average balance of non-accruing loans and leases is immaterial as a percentage of total loans and leases and has been included in net loans and leases. \n (2) Loan and lease fees of $257,000, $533,000 and $238,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, have been included in the interest income computation. \n (3) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments that primarily relate to income on certain loans and securities that is exempt from federal income taxes. The effective federal statutory tax rate was 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 34% in 2017. \n (4) The rate/volume variance has been included in the rate variance. \n 37 \n \nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Company experienced net loan and lease recoveries of $86,000 or -0.02% of average loans and leases during 2019 and recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $660,000 to support the Company's loan growth during the year. The Company experienced net loan and lease losses of $261,000 or 0.08% of average loans and leases during 2018, compared to net loan and lease losses of $794,000 or 0.25% of average loans and leases during 2017. To support the net losses in 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded provisions for loan and lease losses of $175,000 and $450,000, respectively during 2018 and 2017. The level of nonperforming loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to zero at December 31, 2019. For additional information see the Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases\u201d and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nNoninterest Income\nTable Four below provides a summary of the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n Table Four: Components of Noninterest Income \n\nNoninterest income increased $175,000 (11.6%) to $1,688,000 in 2019 from $1,513,000 in 2018. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily related to higher gains on sale of securities which increased $84,000 (271.0%) from 2018 to 2019 and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts which increased $82,000 (17.2%) from $476,000 in 2018 to $558,000 in 2019.\nNoninterest income decreased $83,000 (5.2%) to $1,513,000 in 2018 from $1,596,000 in 2017. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily related to lower gains on sale of securities. Gain on sales of securities decreased $130,000 (81.3%) from 2017 to 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $11,316,000 (up $1,113,000 or 10.9%) for 2019, compared to $10,203,000 in 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from a full year of salary and benefits for new hires in 2018 including additional relationship managers and lending support personnel, as well as, increased incentive payments to the relationship managers due to the increased loan production in 2019. Salary expense in 2019 also includes normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 102 during 2019 compared to 97 during 2018. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\nSalaries and benefits were $10,203,000 (up $1,283,000 or 14.4%) for 2018, compared to $8,920,000 in 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from filling some vacant positions, hiring additional relationship managers, creating a position for a Chief Lending Officer in December 2017, and normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 97 during 2018 compared to 93 during 2017. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\n 38 \n \nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2019 was $134,000 (up $114,000 or 570.0%) compared to $20,000 in 2018. The primary reason for the increase in OREO related expense was due to the $111,000 write-down of the Company's lone remaining property in 2019 after receipt of an updated property valuation report. Operating expenses on the properties in 2019 totaled $23,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. Write-downs on the property totaled $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company held one property with a book value of $846,000.\nThe total OREO expense in 2018 was $20,000 (down $24,000 or 54.5%) compared to $44,000 in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses was due to the sale of one of the properties in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2017 totaled $52,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. In 2017, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were $8,000 compared to zero in 2018. There were no write-downs on any of the properties held during 2017 compared to write-downs of $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company held one property with a book value of $957,000.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $27,000 (2.6%) during 2019 to $1,023,000, compared to $1,050,000 in 2018. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $11,000 (2.0%) during 2019 to $542,000 compared to $553,000 in 2018. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nOccupancy expense decreased $3,000 (0.3%) during 2018 to $1,050,000, compared to $1,053,000 in 2017. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $33,000 (5.6%) during 2018 to $553,000 compared to $586,000 in 2017. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $154,000 (76.2%) during 2019 to $48,000, compared to $202,000 in 2018. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2019 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $78,000 in 2018. The decrease in FDIC assessments in 2019 is due to the receipt of the FDIC's Small Bank Assessment Credits during the year as the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio exceeded 1.35%.\nFDIC assessments decreased $4,000 (1.9%) during 2018 to $202,000, compared to $206,000 in 2017. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2018 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $74,000 in 2017.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\n 39 \n \nOther expenses were $3,705,000 (up $301,000 or 8.8%) for 2019, compared to $3,404,000 for 2018. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional fees (up $68,000) and bank charges (up $233,000) (which is included in the other operating expenses line item). The increase in professional expenses is related to more services being provided by the Company's network administrator. The higher bank charges relate to lower average balances maintained by the Company in these accounts in 2019 resulting in higher service charges and the interest earned on these balances began to increase in 2018 due to the higher interest rate environment and continued into 2019, as a result, in 2019 the Company began being recording this as interest income on deposits held in other banks. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in telephone expense which decreased $91,000 (26.6%) from $342,000 in 2018 to $251,000 in 2019 and relates to the Company converted to a more cost-effective telephone system. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2019 was 67.1% compared to 69.4% in 2018.\nOther expenses were $3,404,000 (up $238,000 or 7.5%) for 2018, compared to $3,166,000 for 2017. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the advertising and promotion expense category. Advertising and promotion expense increased $333,000 (146.1%), from $228,000 in 2017 to $561,000 in 2018. Much of this increase is related to the expenses to sponsor community events and other promotional activities as the Company is focusing more effort in our markets to strengthen our brand. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2018 was 69.4% compared to 65.8% in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.6%, 24.3%, and 50.4% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $610,000, $523,000, and $420,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,361,000, $1,315,000, and $1,471,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared 2018 is related to the tax treatment of equity based compensation under Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). Under ASU 2016-09, if the market value of the Company's stock price on the date restricted stock vests is higher than the Company's stock price on the date the restricted stock was awarded the Company receives a tax credit for the difference in values and if the market price on the vesting date is lower than the stock price on the award date the Company recognizes additional tax expense. During 2018, the Company recognized a $166,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09 and in 2019 the Company recognized a $34,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09.\nThe lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 results from the lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, which was a reduction from the Company's 2017 rate of 34%. The high effective tax rate in 2017 resulted from the Company recording an income tax expense adjustment of $1,220,000 related to H.R.1\u201d commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The adjustment relates to revaluing the Company's net deferred tax assets using the new lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company's taxable income in 2018 was $6,474,000 up slightly from $6,450,000 in 2017, however, the combined federal and State income tax expense decreased $1,678,000 (51.6%) from $3,252,000 in 2017 to $1,574,000 in 2018. Excluding the $1,220,000 adjustment related to H.R.1, the tax expense would have been $2,032,000 in 2017. Comparing the actual expense of $1,574,000 in 2018 to the adjusted expense of $2,032,000 in 2017 points out the benefit of the lower 21% federal tax rate.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $720,353,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $688,092,000 at December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $32,261,000 (4.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2019 were $703,205,000, up $21,575,000 or 3.2% from the 2018 average balances of total assets of $681,630,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement asset/liability management strategies as part of our contingency funding plan and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors. Table Six below summarizes the values of the Company's investment securities held on December 31 of the years indicated. The Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading in any of the years indicated below.\n 40 \n \nTable Six: Investment Securities Composition\n(dollars in thousands)\n\nNet unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2,554,000 were recorded, net of $752,000 in tax liabilities, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 and net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2,664,000 were recorded, net of $788,000 in tax assets, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018. Management periodically evaluates each investment security in a loss position for other than temporary impairment relying primarily on industry analyst reports, observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations. Management has the ability and intent to hold securities with established maturity dates until recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity, and believes it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms for all of the underlying investment securities; therefore, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. See Table Fifteen, Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields,\u201d for a breakdown of the investment securities by maturity and the corresponding weighted average yields.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company concentrates its lending activities in the following principal areas: (1) commercial; (2) commercial real estate; (3) multi-family real estate; (4) real estate construction (both commercial and residential); (5) residential real estate; (6) lease financing receivable; (7) agriculture; and (8) consumer loans. At December 31, 2019, these categories accounted for approximately 11%, 54%, 14%, 6%, 7%, 0%, 2% and 6%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio compared to approximately 9%, 62%, 18%, 2%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 3%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Also, as noted in Table 7 below, the Company's primary focus is commercial and real estate loans, however, in 2018 the Company was selected by a lender that specializes in classic and collector cars. The company began purchasing loans from this lender during the third quarter of 2018 and recorded $10,791,000 during 2018 and $20,960,000 during 2019 and accounts for the increase in consumer loans.\nContinuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, an upgraded lending team in 2018, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $149 million in loans in 2019 and $104 million in 2018 compared to $30 million in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\t Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business-Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10K\u201d) contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis used in the computation of the net interest margin and efficiency ratio. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10K because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company's financial position reflected in the results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.\nTangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures)\nTangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create tangible equity\u201d facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations. The Company's management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible shareholder's equity for the periods presented.\nReconciliation to Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other intangible assets (goodwill) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,321 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tangible common shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures)\nIn accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio. The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 21% effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 34% effective tax rate for 2017, allows comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company's overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.\nReconciliation of Annualized Net Interest Margin, Fully Tax Equivalent (non-GAAP)\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax equivalent adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income - tax equivalent adjusted (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average earning assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>650,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 32 \n \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure - Efficiency Ratio\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax equivalent adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income - tax-equivalent adjusted (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,743 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,049 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Efficiency ratio, fully tax-equivalent (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2019 of $5,500,000, an increase of $600,000 (12.2%) from $4,900,000 in 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $0.94 for 2019 and $0.83 for 2018. For 2019, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.92% and a return on average assets of 0.78%, compared to 6.77% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2018.\n 33 \n \nNet income for 2018 increased $1,702,000 (53.2%) from $3,198,000 in 2017. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $0.50. For 2017, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.91% and return on average assets of 0.49%.

At December 31, 2019, net loans totaled $393,802,000, an increase of $75,286,000 (23.6%) from the ending balance of $318,516,000 at December 31, 2018. Deposits increased $14,163,000 or 2.4% from $590,674,000 at December 31, 2018 to $604,837,000 at December 31, 2019. Shareholders' equity increased $8,188,000 or 11.0% from $74,721,000 at December 31, 2018 to $82,909,000 at December 31, 2019. The Company ended 2019 with a leverage capital ratio of 9.2% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.9% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 8.9% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.3% at the end of 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% in 2019, 3.41% in 2018, and 3.39% in 2017. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $2,570,000 (12.3%), from $20,853,000 in 2018 to $23,423,000 in 2019. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $1,110,000 (5.6%), from $19,743,000 in 2017 to $20,853,000 in 2018.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $3,435,000 (15.3%) from $22,449,000 in 2018 to $25,884,000 in 2019. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,335,000) and volume (up $2,100,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.72% in 2018 to 4.95% in 2019 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.66% in 2018 to 2.81% in 2019. The increased yield in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.67% during 2018 to 3.98% during 2019. The volume increase of $2,100,000 was primarily from an increase in loans ($2,394,000) and interest-bearing deposits in banks ($153,000), partially offset by a decrease in investment balances ($103,000) and Federal funds ($345,000). Average loans balances increased $50,964,000, (or 16.5%), from $308,365,000 during 2018 to $359,329,000 during 2019, average interest-bearing deposits in banks increased $168,000, (or 509.1%), from $33,000 during 2018 to $201,000 during 2019 average investment balances decreased $1,602,000, (or 0.6%), from $282,898,000 during 2018 to $281,296,000 in 2019, and average Federal funds decreased $18,515,000, (or 99.1%), from $18,688,000 during 2018 to $173,000 in 2019.\n 34 \n \nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,645,000 (7.9%) from $20,804,000 in 2017 to $22,449,000 in 2018. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is comprised of two components - rate (up $1,764,000) and volume (down $119,000). The primary driver in this rate increase was an increase in the yield on loans which saw an increase from 4.57% in 2017 to 4.72% in 2018 and an increase in the yield on investments, which saw an increase from 2.36% in 2017 to 2.66% in 2018. The increased yield in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the overall higher interest rate environment. The yield on earning assets increased from 3.57% during 2017 to 3.67% during 2018. The increase in yield from the loans and investments was partially offset by an increase in the balances of Federal funds sold. Federal funds sold balances increased from zero in 2017 to an average balance of $18,688,000 in 2018. However, the yield on these lower earning Federal fund balances was 1.86%, thus partially reducing the overall yield on earning assets. The volume decrease of $119,000 was primarily from a decrease in loans ($515,000), partially offset by an increase in investment balances ($391,000). Average loans balances decreased $11,266,000, (or 3.5%), from $319,631,000 during 2017 to $308,365,000 during 2018 and the average investment balances increased $21,344,000, (or 8.2%), from $261,554,000 during 2017 to $282,898,000 in 2018.\nInterest expense was $865,000 (or 54.2%) higher in 2019 compared to 2018, increasing from $1,596,000 to $2,461,000. The $865,000 increase in interest expense during 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher rates (up $745,000) and higher volume (up $120,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 22 basis points from 0.41% to 0.63% for 2018 compared to 2019. The largest increase due to rates occurred in interest checking and money market accounts and in the time deposits. The rate paid on interest checking and money market accounts increased from 0.14% during 2018 to 0.34% during 2019 and accounted for $300,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The rate paid on time deposit accounts increased from 1.86% during 2018 to 2.89% during 2019 and accounted for $342,000 of the $745,000 increase attributed to rates. The volume increase of $120,000 was attributed to an increase in average time deposit balances which increased from $79,422,000 during 2018 to $85,723,000 during 2019 and accounted for $84,000 of the $120,000 increase and an increase in average other borrowings which increased from $15,533,000 during 2018 to $18,430,000 during 2019 and accounted for $44,000 of the $120,000 increase.\nInterest expense was $535,000 (or 50.4%) higher in 2018 compared to 2017, increasing from $1,061,000 to $1,596,000. The $535,000 increase in interest expense during 2018 compared to 2017 was due to higher rates (up $531,000) and higher volume (up $4,000). The increase in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rates paid on deposit and borrowing balances during a higher interest rate environment. Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points from 0.30% to 0.41% for 2017 compared to 2018. The largest increase due to rates occurred in the time deposits. Some of these time deposits are indexed to the three- or six-month treasury rates which have increased over the past twelve months. Interest expense on time deposits increased by $367,000, (or 52.9%), from $694,000 in 2017 to $1,061,000 in 2018 while the average time deposit balances decreased by $1,634,000, (or 2.0%), from $81,056,000 in 2017 to $79,422,000 in 2018.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses.

The Company experienced net loan and lease losses of $261,000 or 0.08% of average loans and leases during 2018, compared to net loan and lease losses of $794,000 or 0.25% of average loans and leases during 2017. To support the net losses in 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded provisions for loan and lease losses of $175,000 and $450,000, respectively during 2018 and 2017. The level of nonperforming loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to zero at December 31, 2019.

The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily related to higher gains on sale of securities which increased $84,000 (271.0%) from 2018 to 2019 and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts which increased $82,000 (17.2%) from $476,000 in 2018 to $558,000 in 2019.\nNoninterest income decreased $83,000 (5.2%) to $1,513,000 in 2018 from $1,596,000 in 2017. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily related to lower gains on sale of securities. Gain on sales of securities decreased $130,000 (81.3%) from 2017 to 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $11,316,000 (up $1,113,000 or 10.9%) for 2019, compared to $10,203,000 in 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from a full year of salary and benefits for new hires in 2018 including additional relationship managers and lending support personnel, as well as, increased incentive payments to the relationship managers due to the increased loan production in 2019. Salary expense in 2019 also includes normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 102 during 2019 compared to 97 during 2018. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\nSalaries and benefits were $10,203,000 (up $1,283,000 or 14.4%) for 2018, compared to $8,920,000 in 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense resulted from filling some vacant positions, hiring additional relationship managers, creating a position for a Chief Lending Officer in December 2017, and normal cost of living increases and promotions. Average full-time equivalent employees was 97 during 2018 compared to 93 during 2017. Employer benefit expenses, such as insurance, 401(k) matching and incentives and payroll taxes increased commensurate with the increased staffing levels.\n 38 \n \nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2019 was $134,000 (up $114,000 or 570.0%) compared to $20,000 in 2018. The primary reason for the increase in OREO related expense was due to the $111,000 write-down of the Company's lone remaining property in 2019 after receipt of an updated property valuation report. Operating expenses on the properties in 2019 totaled $23,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. Write-downs on the property totaled $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company held one property with a book value of $846,000.\nThe total OREO expense in 2018 was $20,000 (down $24,000 or 54.5%) compared to $44,000 in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses was due to the sale of one of the properties in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2017 totaled $52,000 compared to $16,000 in 2018. In 2017, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were $8,000 compared to zero in 2018. There were no write-downs on any of the properties held during 2017 compared to write-downs of $4,000 in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company held one property with a book value of $957,000.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $27,000 (2.6%) during 2019 to $1,023,000, compared to $1,050,000 in 2018. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $11,000 (2.0%) during 2019 to $542,000 compared to $553,000 in 2018. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nOccupancy expense decreased $3,000 (0.3%) during 2018 to $1,050,000, compared to $1,053,000 in 2017. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $33,000 (5.6%) during 2018 to $553,000 compared to $586,000 in 2017. The decrease in occupancy and furniture and equipment expense decrease resulted from lower depreciation expense on premises and equipment leased or owned by the Company.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $154,000 (76.2%) during 2019 to $48,000, compared to $202,000 in 2018. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2019 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $78,000 in 2018. The decrease in FDIC assessments in 2019 is due to the receipt of the FDIC's Small Bank Assessment Credits during the year as the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio exceeded 1.35%.\nFDIC assessments decreased $4,000 (1.9%) during 2018 to $202,000, compared to $206,000 in 2017. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2018 were $78,000, compared to an expense of $74,000 in 2017.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outsourced item processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors' expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telephone and postage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 39 \n \nOther expenses were $3,705,000 (up $301,000 or 8.8%) for 2019, compared to $3,404,000 for 2018. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional fees (up $68,000) and bank charges (up $233,000) (which is included in the other operating expenses line item). The increase in professional expenses is related to more services being provided by the Company's network administrator. The higher bank charges relate to lower average balances maintained by the Company in these accounts in 2019 resulting in higher service charges and the interest earned on these balances began to increase in 2018 due to the higher interest rate environment and continued into 2019, as a result, in 2019 the Company began being recording this as interest income on deposits held in other banks. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in telephone expense which decreased $91,000 (26.6%) from $342,000 in 2018 to $251,000 in 2019 and relates to the Company converted to a more cost-effective telephone system. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2019 was 67.1% compared to 69.4% in 2018.\nOther expenses were $3,404,000 (up $238,000 or 7.5%) for 2018, compared to $3,166,000 for 2017. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the advertising and promotion expense category. Advertising and promotion expense increased $333,000 (146.1%), from $228,000 in 2017 to $561,000 in 2018. Much of this increase is related to the expenses to sponsor community events and other promotional activities as the Company is focusing more effort in our markets to strengthen our brand. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2018 was 69.4% compared to 65.8% in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 25.6%, 24.3%, and 50.4% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $610,000, $523,000, and $420,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,361,000, $1,315,000, and $1,471,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared 2018 is related to the tax treatment of equity based compensation under Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). Under ASU 2016-09, if the market value of the Company's stock price on the date restricted stock vests is higher than the Company's stock price on the date the restricted stock was awarded the Company receives a tax credit for the difference in values and if the market price on the vesting date is lower than the stock price on the award date the Company recognizes additional tax expense. During 2018, the Company recognized a $166,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09 and in 2019 the Company recognized a $34,000 tax credit under ASU 2016-09.\nThe lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 results from the lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, which was a reduction from the Company's 2017 rate of 34%. The high effective tax rate in 2017 resulted from the Company recording an income tax expense adjustment of $1,220,000 related to H.R.1\u201d commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The adjustment relates to revaluing the Company's net deferred tax assets using the new lower corporate federal income tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company's taxable income in 2018 was $6,474,000 up slightly from $6,450,000 in 2017, however, the combined federal and State income tax expense decreased $1,678,000 (51.6%) from $3,252,000 in 2017 to $1,574,000 in 2018. Excluding the $1,220,000 adjustment related to H.R.1, the tax expense would have been $2,032,000 in 2017. Comparing the actual expense of $1,574,000 in 2018 to the adjusted expense of $2,032,000 in 2017 points out the benefit of the lower 21% federal tax rate.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $720,353,000 at December 31, 2019 compared to $688,092,000 at December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $32,261,000 (4.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2019 were $703,205,000, up $21,575,000 or 3.2% from the 2018 average balances of total assets of $681,630,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement asset/liability management strategies as part of our contingency funding plan and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.

Management periodically evaluates each investment security in a loss position for other than temporary impairment relying primarily on industry analyst reports, observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations. Management has the ability and intent to hold securities with established maturity dates until recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity, and believes it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms for all of the underlying investment securities; therefore, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. See Table Fifteen, Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields,\u201d for a breakdown of the investment securities by maturity and the corresponding weighted average yields.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company concentrates its lending activities in the following principal areas: (1) commercial; (2) commercial real estate; (3) multi-family real estate; (4) real estate construction (both commercial and residential); (5) residential real estate; (6) lease financing receivable; (7) agriculture; and (8) consumer loans. At December 31, 2019, these categories accounted for approximately 11%, 54%, 14%, 6%, 7%, 0%, 2% and 6%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio compared to approximately 9%, 62%, 18%, 2%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 3%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Also, as noted in Table 7 below, the Company's primary focus is commercial and real estate loans, however, in 2018 the Company was selected by a lender that specializes in classic and collector cars. The company began purchasing loans from this lender during the third quarter of 2018 and recorded $10,791,000 during 2018 and $20,960,000 during 2019 and accounts for the increase in consumer loans.\nContinuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, an upgraded lending team in 2018, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $149 million in loans in 2019 and $104 million in 2018 compared to $30 million in"}
