Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed above in Risk Factors\u201d and those identified below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a recently-formed commercial real estate finance company. Our primary investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time primarily through consistent current income dividends and other distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by originating, structuring and investing in first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate properties. Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry, secured by real estate, equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations governing such borrowers. We intend to grow the size of our portfolio by continuing the track record of our business and the business conducted by our Manager and its affiliates by making loans to leading operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. There is no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective.\nWe believe that cannabis operators' limited access to traditional bank and non-bank financing has provided attractive opportunities for us to make loans to companies that exhibit strong fundamentals but require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can provide in the current regulatory environment. We believe that continued state-level legalization of cannabis for medical and adult use creates an increased loan demand by companies operating in the cannabis industry and property owners leasing to cannabis tenants. Furthermore, we believe we are differentiated from our competitors because we seek to target operators and facilities that exhibit relatively lower-risk characteristics, which we believe include generally limiting exposure to ground-up construction, lending to cannabis operators with operational and/or profitable facilities, diversification of geographies and distribution channels, among other factors. We expect cannabis lending will continue to be a principal investment strategy for the foreseeable future; however, we expect to also lend to or invest in companies or properties that are not related to the cannabis industry if they provide return characteristics consistent with our investment objective. From time to time, we may also invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity or other forms of joint venture equity to the extent consistent with our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. We may enter into credit agreements with borrowers that permit them to incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans we extend to such companies under such credit agreements. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio includes one loan that is subordinate to a first mortgage that comprises approximately 6.9% of our total assets as of such date.\nOur Manager and its affiliates seek to originate real estate loans between $5 million and $200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms and amortization when terms exceed three years. We generally act as co-lenders in such transactions and intend to hold up to $30 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the remainder to be held by affiliates or third party co-investors. We may revise such concentration limits from time to time as our loan portfolio grows. Other investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions in a loan where we have also invested, including by means of splitting commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating loans. We will not engage in a co-investment transaction with an affiliate where the affiliate has a senior position to the loan held by us. To the extent that an affiliate provides financing to one of our borrowers, such loans will be working capital loans or loans that are subordinate to our loans. We may also serve as co-lenders in loans originated by third parties and, in the future, we may also acquire loans or loan participations. Loans that have a one to two year maturity are generally interest only loans.\nOur loans are secured by real estate and, in addition, when lending to owner-operators in the cannabis industry, other collateral, such as equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we seek to impose strict loan covenants and seek personal or corporate guarantees for additional protection. As of December 31, 2021, 47.6% of the loans held in our portfolio are backed by personal or corporate guarantees. We aim to maintain a portfolio diversified across jurisdictions and across verticals, including cultivators, processors, dispensaries, as well as ancillary businesses. In addition, we may invest in borrowers that have equity securities that are publicly traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange ( CSE\u201d) in Canada and/or over-the-counter in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio is comprised primarily of first mortgages to established multi-state or single-state cannabis operators or property owners. We consider cannabis operators to be established if they are state-licensed and are deemed to be operational by the applicable state regulator. We do not own any stock, warrants to purchase stock or other forms of equity in any of our portfolio companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, and we will not take stock, warrants or equity in such issuers until permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal laws and regulations.\nOur Manager's Investment Committee, which is comprised of John Mazarakis, Anthony Cappell, Dr. Andreas Bodmeier, and Peter Sack, advises and consults with our Manager and its investment professionals with respect to our investment strategy, portfolio construction, financing and investment guidelines and risk management and approves all of our investments. The investment professionals of our Manager have over 100 years of combined experience in private credit, real estate lending, retail, real estate acquisitions and development, investment advice, risk management, and consulting. Collectively, the investment professionals have originated, underwritten, structured, documented, managed, or syndicated over $8.0 billion in credit and real estate transactions, which includes loans to cannabis operators, loans to companies engaged in activities unrelated to cannabis, as well as commercial real estate loans. In addition, our investment professionals have substantial workout and foreclosure experience across over 80 loans amounting to over $1 billion of aggregate face value. The depth and breadth of the management and investment team allows our Manager to address all facets of our operations.\nWe are an externally managed Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution tests, which in turn depend, in part, on our operating results. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us and our subsidiaries to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Additionally, because we have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and This Offering - We are an emerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make shares of our common stock less attractive to investors\u201d for certain risks related to our status as an emerging growth company.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nRevenues\nWe operate as one operating segment and are primarily focused on financing senior secured loans and other types of loans for established state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry. These loans are generally held for investment and are secured by real estate, equipment, licenses and other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and the regulations governing such borrowers.\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on loans. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of our portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans, and 46.8% of our portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2021, none of our loans earn interest at a variable rate tied to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Interest on our loans is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of our loans and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon generally become due at the applicable maturity date. In some cases, our interest income includes a PIK component for a portion of the total interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable loan agreement, is accrued in accordance with the terms of such loan agreement and capitalized to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. The PIK interest added to the principal balance is typically amortized and paid in accordance with the applicable loan agreement. In cases where the loans do not amortize, the PIK interest is collected and recognized upon repayment of the outstanding principal. We also generate revenue from OID, which is also recognized as interest income from loans over the initial term of the applicable loans. Delayed draw loans may earn interest or unused fees on the undrawn portion of the loan, which is recognized as interest income in the period earned. Other fees, including prepayment fees and exit fees, are also recognized as interest income when received. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our loans and recognized as earned in accordance with GAAP.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expense is the payment of Base Management Fees and Incentive Compensation under our Management Agreement with our Manager and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses paid or incurred on our behalf, including reimbursing our Manager for a certain portion of the compensation of certain personnel of our Manager who assist in the management of our affairs, excepting only those expenses that are specifically the responsibility of our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\nTable 224: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>organizational and offering expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>quarterly valuation expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making loans and valuing loans (including third-party valuation firms); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>fees and expenses associated with investor relations and marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>federal and state registration fees; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>any exchange listing fees; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>federal, state and local taxes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>brokerage commissions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depends, in part, on our operating results.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of 1) 85% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. Our stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If it is determined that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend) for the current year from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is included in the line item income tax expense. For the period from March 30, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 we did not incur excise tax expense.\nFactors Impacting our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which includes the accretion and amortization of OID, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of loan, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, some of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates and Effect on Net Interest Income\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations.\nOur operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally will be based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (a) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate loan assets will remain static, and (b) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating-rate loan assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Cap Risk\nWe currently own and intend to acquire in the future floating-rate assets. These are assets in which the loans may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which limit the amount by which the asset's interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements may not be subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest-rate yields on our floating-rate assets would effectively be limited. In addition, floating-rate assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of cash income from such assets in an amount that is less than the amount that we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings.\nThese factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, all of our floating rate loans have interest rate floors, and none of our loans are subject to interest rate caps.\nInterest Rate Mismatch Risk\nWe may fund a portion of our origination of loans, or of loans that we may in the future acquire, with borrowings that are based on the prime rate or a similar measure, while the interest rates on these assets may be fixed or indexed to the prime rate or another index rate. Accordingly, any increase in the prime rate will generally result in an increase in our borrowing costs that would not be matched by fixed-rate interest earnings and may not be matched by a corresponding increase in floating-rate interest earnings. Any such interest rate mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders.\nOur analysis of risks is based on our Manager's experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by our Manager and our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe that favorable market conditions, including an imbalance in supply and demand of credit to cannabis operating companies, have provided attractive opportunities for non-bank lenders, such as us, to finance commercial real estate loans and other loans that exhibit strong fundamentals but also require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can presently provide. Additionally, to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, our addressable market will increase. We intend to continue our track record of capitalizing on these opportunities and growing the size of our portfolio.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results. None of our borrowers are now, or have previously been, in default under their respective loan agreements with us.\nWe expect to be subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding our portfolio of loans. We will have exposure to credit risk on our commercial real estate loans and other targeted types of loans. Our Manager will seek to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate.\nCredit risk will also be addressed through our Manager's on-going review, and loans will be monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and cash flow on a quarterly basis.\nOur Manager or affiliates of our Manager have originated all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we may in the future also acquire loans from time to time. Our Investment Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time.\nOur loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 was concentrated with the top three borrowers representing approximately 34.6% of the funded principal and approximately 31.9% of the total commitments to borrowers. The largest loan represented approximately 15.0% of the funded principal and approximately 12.8% of the total commitments as of December 31, 2021.\nOur largest borrower, the borrower for Loan #2 ( Borrower #2\u201d), as of December 31, 2021 is a vertically integrated multi-state operator with operations in 14 different states. The senior term loan provided to Borrower #2 had $30.0 million outstanding principal as of December 31, 2021, of which $0 was unfunded. This senior term loan was advanced in three tranches, of which the first tranche ($4.0 million), second tranche ($16.0 million), and third tranche ($10.0 million) accrue interest at a rate of 15.25%, 9.75%, and 8.5% per annum, respectively, payable in cash. This senior term loan was funded with OID of 1.0%, 3.25%, and 2.4% on the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also requires the payment of a monthly agency fee paid to our Manager of 15 basis points, 12 basis points, and 5 basis points on the outstanding principal balance of the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also has a 1.0% exit fee, and certain prepayment fees, including 1.0% for prepayments occurring within 9 months of the advance date. This senior term loan contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings, including covenants that limit the borrower's ability to incur, create, or assume certain unsecured indebtedness, and borrower's ability to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, and asset sales. This senior term loan also requires Borrower #2 to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants (measured at the end of each fiscal quarter), including a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. This senior term loan also contains customary events of default (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) including, but not limited to, the failure to make payments of interest or premium, if any, on, or principal under the loans, the failure to comply with certain covenants and agreements specified in the credit agreement, defaults in respect of certain other indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. If any event of default occurs, the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the senior term loans may become due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 3.0%, or 6.0% for material events of default, may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and our Manager may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) and take such other actions as set forth in the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations under the credit agreement would automatically become due and payable.\nThe Company measures current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d) for loans held for investment based on Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13). The Company early adopted ASU 2016-13 at formation, which introduces a new credit loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss\u201d methodology for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. CECL amended the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The allowance for credit losses (the CECL Reserve\u201d) required under ASU 2016-13 is deducted from the respective loans' amortized cost basis on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses.\nRefer to footnote 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the period March 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021, titled Loans Held for Investment, net\u201d for more information on CECL.\nRisk Management\nTo the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio of loans. Generally, with the guidance and experience of our Manager:\nTable 235: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we manage our portfolio through an interactive process with our Manager and generally service our self-originated loans through our Manager's servicer; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we invest in a mix of floating-and fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we actively employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager's risk management tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we seek to manage credit risk through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate.

Additionally, on January 18, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $25.0 million, $10.0 million of which was advanced at closing. Further, on January 25, 2022, we funded an additional advance on an existing borrower's credit facility in the amount of $545,000. On February 3, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $30.0 million, all of which was advanced at closing. On March, 2, 2022, March 9, 2022, and March 17, 2022, we funded additional advances to three existing borrowers' credit facilities in the amounts of $1.8 million, $490,000, and $5.0 million, respectively. Lastly, on March 11, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $20.0 million, $17.5 million of which was advanced at closing.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nFor the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share of our common stock, relating to the period since our inception through the second quarter of 2021, which was paid on July 15, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $1,068,551.\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of our common stock, relating to the third quarter of 2021, which was paid on October 20, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,067,521.\nFor the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of our common stock, relating to the fourth quarter of 2021, which was paid on January 14, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,512,329.\nThe payment of these dividends is not indicative of our ability to pay such dividends in the future.\nCOVID-19\nThe spread of a novel strain of COVID-19 has caused significant business disruptions in the United States beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns (subject to exceptions for certain essential\u201d operations and businesses). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical cannabis companies have been deemed essential\u201d by almost all of states with legalized cannabis and stay-at-home orders. Consequently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related regulatory and private sector response on our financial and operating results for the period ended December 31, 2021 was somewhat mitigated as all of our borrowers were permitted to continue to operate during this pandemic and we have not experienced any payment default by our borrowers nor have we made any concessions on any payments due, in each case, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRegardless, the full extent of the economic impact of the business disruptions caused by COVID-19 is uncertain. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving, and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including the regulated cannabis industry. Although some of these measures have been lifted or scaled back, a recent resurgence of COVID-19 in certain parts of the world, including the United States, has resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and may lead to more restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The extent of any effect that these disruptions may have on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments, including possible impacts on the performance of our loans, general business activity, and ability to generate revenue, which cannot be determined. For more information see Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy - The current outbreak of COVID-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or cause disruption to our borrowers and their operations, and in turn our ability to continue to execute our business plan.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021\nWe commenced operations on March 30, 2021 and, therefore, have no period to compare results for the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021. Our net income allocable to our common stockholders for the period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $9.5 million or $1.47 per basic weighted average common share. Net income of approximately $9.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2021, was comprised of approximately $10.7 million of interest income, $325,648 of prepayment fee income, offset by management fees of $905,123, general and administrative expenses of 195,087, organizational expenses of $167,591, change in the provision for current expected credit losses of 147,949, professional fees of $57,458, and stock based compensation expense of $29,611. Interest income for the period ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of approximately $9.3 million of cash interest, $798,000 of PIK interest, $596,000 of OID amortization, and $61,000 of unused fee income.\nFor the period presented, we incurred Base Management Fees payable to our Manager of $905,123, which was net of a Base Management Fee Rebate of $187,028. Our Manager has incurred $244,720 in general and administrative expenses on our behalf and was reimbursed approximately $102,829 of such amount. Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreements executed by our Manager, dated June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, all Base Management Fees that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021 were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date. Additionally, Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreement executed by our Manager, dated December 31, 2021, all Incentive Compensation that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, as well as a portion of reimbursable expenses incurred during the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date.\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we recorded a provision for current expected credit loss of $147,949, or 6 basis points of our total loans held at carrying value commitment balance of approximately $235.1 million and was bifurcated between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value of $134,542 and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of $13,407. The liability is based on the unfunded portion of loan commitments over the full contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. Management considered the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the expected credit loss on the funded portion. We continuously evaluate the credit quality of each loan by assessing the risk factors of each loan.\nIn connection with the commencement of our operations, we acquired a portfolio of loans from affiliated private funds managed by an affiliate of our Manager at fair value of approximately $9.9 million. An original issue discount was recorded related to the portfolio of loans acquired at fair value. The original issue discount was approximately equivalent to $81,187 of unaccreted OID associated with the underlying loans in the portfolio, which were originated prior to March 30, 2021 in arm's-length transactions. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums on loans held for investment over the life of the related loan held for investment utilizing a method which approximates the effective interest method. In circumstances where, in management's opinion, the difference between the straight-line and effective interest methods is immaterial, the straight-line method is used.\nLoan Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio included 21 loans held for investment of approximately $197.0 million of loans receivable. The aggregate originated commitment under these loans was approximately $235.1 million and outstanding principal was approximately $200.6 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our loan portfolio had a weighted-average YTM IRR of 18.6% and was secured by real estate and, with respect to certain of our loans, substantially all assets in the borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including equipment, receivables, and licenses. YTM IRR is calculated using various inputs, including (i) cash and payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest, which is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the applicable loan, (ii) original issue discount ( OID\u201d), (iii) amortization, (iv) unused fees, and (v) exit fees. Certain of our loans have extension fees, which are not included in our YTM IRR calculations, but may increase YTM IRR if such extension options are exercised by borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any loans held for investment with floating interest rates tied to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of its portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans that pay interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin, and were subject to a prime rate floor of 3.25%.

Loan terms that may be modified include interest rates, required prepayments, maturity dates, covenants, principal amounts and other loan terms. The terms and conditions of each modification vary based on individual circumstances and will be determined on a case by case basis. Our Manager monitors and evaluates each of our loans held for investment and has maintained regular communications with borrowers regarding the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loans.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are Distributable Earnings, Adjusted Distributable Earnings, book value per share and dividends declared per share.\nDistributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings\nIn addition to using certain financial metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our performance, we also use Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance. Each of Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Distributable Earnings as, for a specified period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) Incentive Compensation, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss); provided that Distributable Earnings does not exclude, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash, (v) provision for current expected credit losses and (vi) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of such independent directors. We define Adjusted Distributable Earnings, for a specified period, as Distributable Earnings excluding certain non-recurring organizational expenses (such as one-time expenses related to our formation and start-up).\nWe believe providing Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100% of such taxable income. Given these requirements and our belief that dividends are generally one of the principal reasons that stockholders invest in our common stock, we generally intend to attempt to pay dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Distributable Earnings is one of many factors considered by our Board in authorizing dividends and, while not a direct measure of net taxable income, over time, the measure can be considered a useful indicator of our dividends.\nDistributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our reported Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the\nperiod from\nMarch 30,\n2021 (inception)\nto\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,496,436 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash equity compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,611 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unrealized (gain), losses, or other non-cash items </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for current expected credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147,949 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Distributable Earnings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,749,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to Distributable Earnings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certain organizational expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted Distributable Earnings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,917,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic weighted average shares of common stock outstanding (in shares) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,442,865 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted Distributable Earnings per Weighted Average Share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding (in shares) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,450,383 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted Distributable Earnings per Weighted Average Share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBook Value Per Share\nThe book value per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $15.13.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nFor the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share of our common stock, relating to the period since our inception through the second quarter of 2021, which was paid on July 15, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $1,068,551.\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of our common stock, relating to the third quarter of 2021, which was paid on October 20, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,067,521.\nFor the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of our common stock, relating to the fourth quarter of 2021, which was paid on January 14, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,512,329.\nThe payment of these dividends is not indicative of our ability to pay such dividends in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and meet other general business needs. We use significant cash to invest in loans, repay principal and interest on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations.\nOur primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our financing sources, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating results. We expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit facilities and (b) public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities. In the future, we may utilize other sources of financing to the extent available to us. As the cannabis industry continues to evolve and to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, the demand for capital continues to increase as operators seek to enter and build out new markets. We expect the principal amount of the loans we originate to increase and that we will need to raise additional equity and/or debt funds to increase our liquidity in the near future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of our cash was unrestricted and totaled approximately $80.2 million.\nThe sources of financing for our target investments are described below.\nCredit Facilities, Warehouse Facilities and Repurchase Agreements\nIn May 2021, in connection with our acquisition of our financing subsidiary, CAL, we were assigned a secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Loan\u201d). The Revolving Loan has an aggregate borrowing base of up to $10,000,000 and bears interest, payable in cash in arrears, at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (x) Prime Rate plus 1.00% and (y) 4.75%. We incurred debt issuance costs of $100,000 related to the origination of the Revolving Loan, which were capitalized and are subsequently being amortized through maturity. The maturity date of the Revolving Loan is the earlier of (i) February 12, 2023 and (ii) the date on which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant to terms in the Revolving Loan agreement.\nOn December 16, 2021, we amended the Revolving Loan (the First Amendment\u201d). The First Amendment increased the loan commitment from $10,000,000 to $45,000,000, decreased the interest rate, from the greater of the (1) Prime Rate plus 1.00% and (2) 4.75% to the greater of (1) the Prime Rate plus the applicable margin and (2) 3.25%. The applicable margin depends on the ratio of debt to equity of CAL and increases from 0% at a ratio of 0.25 to 1 to 1.25% at a ratio of 1.5 to 1. The First Amendment also extended the maturity date from February 12, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 16, 2023 and (ii) the date on which the Revolving Loan is terminated pursuant to terms in the Revolving Loan agreement. We incurred debt issuance costs of $859,500 related to the First Amendment, which were capitalized and are subsequently being amortized through maturity. As of December 31, 2021, unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Loan and First Amendment of $868,022 are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Revolving Loan incurs unused fees at a rate of 0.25% per annum. During the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we incurred $17,916 of unused fees, recorded as General and Administrative Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we did not borrow against the Revolving Loan and therefore no interest expense was incurred for the period then ended. In the future, we may use certain sources of financing to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments, including credit facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. We expect that these facilities will typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2021, we did not borrow against the Revolving Loan and had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Loan as of December 31, 2021.\nCapital Markets\nWe may seek to raise further equity capital and issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments in loans.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from\nMarch 30,\n(inception) to\nDecember 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,496,436 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,770,882) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,725,554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(145,221,676 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,744,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,248,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $5.7 million. For the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, adjustments to net income related to operating activities primarily included accretion of deferred loan original issue discount and other discounts of approximately $596,000, PIK interest of approximately $798,000, provision for current expected credit losses of approximately $148,000, amortization of deferred financing costs relating to the revolving credit facility of approximately $76,000, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $2.6 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $145.2 million. The net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of the cash used for the origination and funding of loans held for investment of approximately $161.7 million, exceeding the cash received from principal repayment of loans held for investment of approximately $9.8 million, cash received from the sale of loans of approximately $4.9 million, purchase of debt securities of approximately $16.1 million, and investment payable to a related party of approximately $1.8 million for the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $219.7 million and related to proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of approximately $226.0 million, less offering costs relating to our initial public offering of approximately $1.2 million, and less approximately $5.1 million in dividends paid.\nLeverage Policies\nAlthough we are not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio, we expect to employ prudent amounts of leverage and, when appropriate, to use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of loans, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. Leverage is primarily used to provide capital for forward commitments until additional equity is raised or additional medium- to long-term financing is arranged. This policy is subject to change by management and our Board.\nDividends\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes and, as such, anticipate annually distributing to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, prior to the deduction for dividends paid and our net capital gain. If we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and (iii) any Required Distribution to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income (including net capital gain) will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gains dividends) for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on a portion of the estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.\nTo the extent that our cash available for distribution is less than the amount required to be distributed under the REIT provisions of the Code, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital or through equity, equity-related or debt financings or, in certain circumstances, asset sales, as to which our ability to consummate transactions in a timely manner on favorable terms, or at all, cannot be assured, or we may make a portion of the Required Distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nPolicies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties. In accordance with SEC guidance, the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that we believe apply to us based on the nature of our initial operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are based upon reasonable assumptions given the information available to us at that time. Our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates will be expanded over time as we fully implement our strategy. Those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor's understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below.\nCECL Reserve\nIn accordance with ASC 326, we record allowances for our loans held for investment. The allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets to present the net carrying value of the amounts expected to be collected on such assets. We estimate our CECL Reserve using a probability-weighted model that considers the likelihood of default and expected loss given default for each individual loan based on the risk profile for approximately three years after which we immediately revert to use of historical loss data. Previously, we utilized the weighted average remaining maturity (\"WARM\") method. For the period ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that the probability-of-default/loss-given-default method is a more suitable for our portfolio and sustainable as part of our operations and ongoing portfolio monitoring process. For the period ended December 31, 2021, there was no material difference in the loan loss reserve outcome under this method, when compared to the previous method applied, and this constitutes a change in method of application of ASC 326, not a change in accounting estimate. In the future, we may use other acceptable methods, such as a discounted cash flow method, WARM method, or other methods permitted under ASC 326.\nASC 326 requires an entity to consider historical loss experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the macroeconomic environment. We evaluate our loans on a collective (pool) basis by aggregating on the basis of similar risk characteristics, primarily: (i) industry sector of the borrower, (ii) risk ratings, (iii) collateral type, and (iv) term, among other characteristics. We make the judgment that loans to cannabis-related borrowers with risk ratings indicating very low or low risk (1 and 2, respectively) that are fully collateralized by real estate with short maturities of less than three years exhibit similar risk characteristics and are evaluated as a pool. Further, loans that are not fully collateralized by real estate, but other forms of collateral, including equity pledges of the borrower, and otherwise have similar characteristics as those collateralized by real estate are evaluated as a pool. All other loans are analyzed individually, either because they operate in a different industry, have higher risk, or have maturities that extend beyond the forecast horizon for which we are able to derive reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nEstimating the CECL Reserve also requires significant judgment with respect to various factors, including (i) the appropriate historical loan loss reference data, (ii) the expected timing of loan repayments, (iii) calibration of the likelihood of default to reflect the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio and (iv) our current and future view of the macroeconomic environment. From time to time, we may consider loan-specific qualitative factors on certain loans to estimate our CECL Reserve, which may include (i) whether cash from the borrower's operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and (iii) the liquidation value of collateral. For loans where we have deemed the borrower/sponsor to be experiencing financial difficulty, we may elect to apply a practical expedient, in which the fair value of the underlying collateral is compared to the amortized cost of the loan in determining a CECL Reserve.\nTo estimate the historic loan losses relevant to our portfolio, we evaluate our historical loan performance, which includes zero realized loan losses since our inception of operations. Additionally, we analyzed our repayment history, noting we have limited true\u201d operating history, since the incorporation date of March 30, 2021. However, our Sponsor has had operations for the past two fiscal years and has made investments in similar loans, that have similar characteristics including; interest rate, collateral coverage, guarantees, and prepayment/make whole provisions, which fall into the pools identified above. The Sponsor has experienced prepayment on six loans since its inception history, and in no such case was an event of loss experienced. Given the similarity of the structuring of the credit agreements for the loans in our portfolio, management considered it appropriate to consider the past repayment history of loans originated by the Sponsor in determining the extent to which we should record a CECL reserve.\nIn addition, we review each loan on a quarterly basis and evaluates the borrower's ability to pay the monthly interest and principal, if required, as well as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. In considering the potential current expected credit loss, the Manager primarily considered significant inputs to our forecasting methods, which include (i) key loan-specific inputs such as the value of the real estate collateral, liens on equity (including the equity in the entity that holds the state-issued license to cultivate, process, distribute, or retail cannabis), presence of personal or corporate guarantees, among other credit enhancements, LTV ratio, loan-term, geographic location, and expected timing and amount of future loan fundings, (ii) performance against the underwritten business plan and our internal loan risk rating and (iii) a macro-economic forecast. Regarding real estate collateral, we cannot take the position of mortgagee-in-possession as long as the property is used by a cannabis operator, but we can request that the court appoint a receiver to manage and operate the subject real property until the foreclosure proceedings are completed. Additionally, while we cannot foreclose under state Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC\u201d) and take title or sell equity in a licensed cannabis business, a potential purchaser of a delinquent or defaulted loan could. Estimating the enterprise value of our borrowers in order to calculate LTV ratios is often a significant estimate. We rely primarily on comparable transactions to estimate enterprise value of our portfolio companies and supplement such analysis with a multiple-based approach to enterprise value to revenue multiples of publicly-traded comparable companies obtained from S&P CapitalIQ as of the relevant period end, to which we apply a private company discount based on our current borrower profile. These estimates may change in future periods based on available future macro-economic data and might result in a material change in our future estimates of expected credit losses for our loan portfolio.\nIn order to estimate the future expected loan losses relevant to our portfolio, we utilize historical market loan loss data obtained from Federal Reserve economic data for bank business loans, which we believe is a reasonably comparable and available data set to our loans. We expect the period from 2018-2021 to be representative for future credit losses during the years of 2022-2024, as the cannabis industry is maturing, consumer adoption is increasing, and demand for production and retail capacity is increasing. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert back to historical loss data. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments.\nAll of the above assumptions, although made with the most available information at the time of the estimate, are subjective and actual activity may not follow the estimated schedule. These assumptions impact the future balances that the loss rate will be applied to and as such impact our CECL Reserve. As we acquire new loans and our Manager monitors loan and borrower performance, these estimates will be revised each period.\nRisk Ratings\nWe assess the risk factors of each loan, and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, payment history, real estate collateral coverage, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, financial performance, enterprise value of the portfolio company, loan structure and exit strategy, and project sponsorship. This review is performed quarterly. Based on a 5-point scale, our loans are rated 1\u201d through 5,\u201d from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows:\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Definition </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Very low risk </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Low risk </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Moderate/average risk </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>High risk/potential for loss: a loan that has a risk of realizing a principal loss </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Impaired/loss likely: a loan that has a high risk of realizing principal loss, has incurred principal loss or an impairment has been recorded </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk ratings are primarily based on historical data and current conditions specific to each portfolio company, as well as consideration of future economic conditions and each borrower's estimated ability to meet debt service requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of loans held at carrying value and loans receivable at carrying value within each risk rating by year of origination is as follows:\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>Risk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,908,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,908,805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,075,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,075,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,984,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,984,566 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a Maryland corporation that intends to elect to be taxed and qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depend, in part, on our operating results.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to the deduction for dividends paid and our net capital gain. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of 1) 85% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any Required Distributions to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. The stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If it is determined that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend) for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is included in the line item income tax expense.\nFASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We have analyzed our various federal and state filing positions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions are well documented and supported as of December 31, 2021. Based on our evaluation, there is no reserve for any uncertain income tax positions. Accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included within other liabilities in the balance sheets.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nAs an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of this offering, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to footnote 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the period March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, titled Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for information on recent accounting pronouncements.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed above in Risk Factors\u201d and those identified below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a recently-formed commercial real estate finance company. Our primary investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time primarily through consistent current income dividends and other distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by originating, structuring and investing in first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate properties. Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry, secured by real estate, equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations governing such borrowers. We intend to grow the size of our portfolio by continuing the track record of our business and the business conducted by our Manager and its affiliates by making loans to leading operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. There is no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective.\nWe believe that cannabis operators' limited access to traditional bank and non-bank financing has provided attractive opportunities for us to make loans to companies that exhibit strong fundamentals but require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can provide in the current regulatory environment. We believe that continued state-level legalization of cannabis for medical and adult use creates an increased loan demand by companies operating in the cannabis industry and property owners leasing to cannabis tenants. Furthermore, we believe we are differentiated from our competitors because we seek to target operators and facilities that exhibit relatively lower-risk characteristics, which we believe include generally limiting exposure to ground-up construction, lending to cannabis operators with operational and/or profitable facilities, diversification of geographies and distribution channels, among other factors. We expect cannabis lending will continue to be a principal investment strategy for the foreseeable future; however, we expect to also lend to or invest in companies or properties that are not related to the cannabis industry if they provide return characteristics consistent with our investment objective. From time to time, we may also invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity or other forms of joint venture equity to the extent consistent with our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. We may enter into credit agreements with borrowers that permit them to incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans we extend to such companies under such credit agreements. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio includes one loan that is subordinate to a first mortgage that comprises approximately 6.9% of our total assets as of such date.\nOur Manager and its affiliates seek to originate real estate loans between $5 million and $200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms and amortization when terms exceed three years. We generally act as co-lenders in such transactions and intend to hold up to $30 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the remainder to be held by affiliates or third party co-investors. We may revise such concentration limits from time to time as our loan portfolio grows. Other investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions in a loan where we have also invested, including by means of splitting commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating loans. We will not engage in a co-investment transaction with an affiliate where the affiliate has a senior position to the loan held by us. To the extent that an affiliate provides financing to one of our borrowers, such loans will be working capital loans or loans that are subordinate to our loans. We may also serve as co-lenders in loans originated by third parties and, in the future, we may also acquire loans or loan participations. Loans that have a one to two year maturity are generally interest only loans.\nOur loans are secured by real estate and, in addition, when lending to owner-operators in the cannabis industry, other collateral, such as equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we seek to impose strict loan covenants and seek personal or corporate guarantees for additional protection. As of December 31, 2021, 47.6% of the loans held in our portfolio are backed by personal or corporate guarantees. We aim to maintain a portfolio diversified across jurisdictions and across verticals, including cultivators, processors, dispensaries, as well as ancillary businesses. In addition, we may invest in borrowers that have equity securities that are publicly traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange ( CSE\u201d) in Canada and/or over-the-counter in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio is comprised primarily of first mortgages to established multi-state or single-state cannabis operators or property owners. We consider cannabis operators to be established if they are state-licensed and are deemed to be operational by the applicable state regulator. We do not own any stock, warrants to purchase stock or other forms of equity in any of our portfolio companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, and we will not take stock, warrants or equity in such issuers until permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal laws and regulations.\nOur Manager's Investment Committee, which is comprised of John Mazarakis, Anthony Cappell, Dr. Andreas Bodmeier, and Peter Sack, advises and consults with our Manager and its investment professionals with respect to our investment strategy, portfolio construction, financing and investment guidelines and risk management and approves all of our investments. The investment professionals of our Manager have over 100 years of combined experience in private credit, real estate lending, retail, real estate acquisitions and development, investment advice, risk management, and consulting. Collectively, the investment professionals have originated, underwritten, structured, documented, managed, or syndicated over $8.0 billion in credit and real estate transactions, which includes loans to cannabis operators, loans to companies engaged in activities unrelated to cannabis, as well as commercial real estate loans. In addition, our investment professionals have substantial workout and foreclosure experience across over 80 loans amounting to over $1 billion of aggregate face value. The depth and breadth of the management and investment team allows our Manager to address all facets of our operations.\nWe are an externally managed Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution tests, which in turn depend, in part, on our operating results. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us and our subsidiaries to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Additionally, because we have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and This Offering - We are an emerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make shares of our common stock less attractive to investors\u201d for certain risks related to our status as an emerging growth company.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nRevenues\nWe operate as one operating segment and are primarily focused on financing senior secured loans and other types of loans for established state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry. These loans are generally held for investment and are secured by real estate, equipment, licenses and other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and the regulations governing such borrowers.\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on loans. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of our portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans, and 46.8% of our portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2021, none of our loans earn interest at a variable rate tied to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Interest on our loans is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of our loans and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon generally become due at the applicable maturity date. In some cases, our interest income includes a PIK component for a portion of the total interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable loan agreement, is accrued in accordance with the terms of such loan agreement and capitalized to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. The PIK interest added to the principal balance is typically amortized and paid in accordance with the applicable loan agreement. In cases where the loans do not amortize, the PIK interest is collected and recognized upon repayment of the outstanding principal. We also generate revenue from OID, which is also recognized as interest income from loans over the initial term of the applicable loans. Delayed draw loans may earn interest or unused fees on the undrawn portion of the loan, which is recognized as interest income in the period earned. Other fees, including prepayment fees and exit fees, are also recognized as interest income when received. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our loans and recognized as earned in accordance with GAAP.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expense is the payment of Base Management Fees and Incentive Compensation under our Management Agreement with our Manager and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses paid or incurred on our behalf, including reimbursing our Manager for a certain portion of the compensation of certain personnel of our Manager who assist in the management of our affairs, excepting only those expenses that are specifically the responsibility of our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n \u25cf organizational and offering expenses; \n \u25cf quarterly valuation expenses; \n \u25cf fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making loans and valuing loans (including third-party valuation firms); \n \u25cf fees and expenses associated with investor relations and marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); \n \u25cf federal and state registration fees; \n \u25cf any exchange listing fees; \n \u25cf federal, state and local taxes; \n \u25cf independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u25cf brokerage commissions; \n \u25cf costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; and \n \u25cf costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are a Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depends, in part, on our operating results.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of 1) 85% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. Our stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If it is determined that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend) for the current year from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is included in the line item income tax expense. For the period from March 30, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 we did not incur excise tax expense.\nFactors Impacting our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which includes the accretion and amortization of OID, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of loan, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, some of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates and Effect on Net Interest Income\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations.\nOur operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally will be based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (a) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate loan assets will remain static, and (b) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating-rate loan assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Cap Risk\nWe currently own and intend to acquire in the future floating-rate assets. These are assets in which the loans may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which limit the amount by which the asset's interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements may not be subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest-rate yields on our floating-rate assets would effectively be limited. In addition, floating-rate assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of cash income from such assets in an amount that is less than the amount that we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings.\nThese factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, all of our floating rate loans have interest rate floors, and none of our loans are subject to interest rate caps.\nInterest Rate Mismatch Risk\nWe may fund a portion of our origination of loans, or of loans that we may in the future acquire, with borrowings that are based on the prime rate or a similar measure, while the interest rates on these assets may be fixed or indexed to the prime rate or another index rate. Accordingly, any increase in the prime rate will generally result in an increase in our borrowing costs that would not be matched by fixed-rate interest earnings and may not be matched by a corresponding increase in floating-rate interest earnings. Any such interest rate mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders.\nOur analysis of risks is based on our Manager's experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by our Manager and our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe that favorable market conditions, including an imbalance in supply and demand of credit to cannabis operating companies, have provided attractive opportunities for non-bank lenders, such as us, to finance commercial real estate loans and other loans that exhibit strong fundamentals but also require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can presently provide. Additionally, to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, our addressable market will increase. We intend to continue our track record of capitalizing on these opportunities and growing the size of our portfolio.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results. None of our borrowers are now, or have previously been, in default under their respective loan agreements with us.\nWe expect to be subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding our portfolio of loans. We will have exposure to credit risk on our commercial real estate loans and other targeted types of loans. Our Manager will seek to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate.\nCredit risk will also be addressed through our Manager's on-going review, and loans will be monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and cash flow on a quarterly basis.\nOur Manager or affiliates of our Manager have originated all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we may in the future also acquire loans from time to time. Our Investment Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time.\nOur loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 was concentrated with the top three borrowers representing approximately 34.6% of the funded principal and approximately 31.9% of the total commitments to borrowers. The largest loan represented approximately 15.0% of the funded principal and approximately 12.8% of the total commitments as of December 31, 2021.\nOur largest borrower, the borrower for Loan #2 ( Borrower #2\u201d), as of December 31, 2021 is a vertically integrated multi-state operator with operations in 14 different states. The senior term loan provided to Borrower #2 had $30.0 million outstanding principal as of December 31, 2021, of which $0 was unfunded. This senior term loan was advanced in three tranches, of which the first tranche ($4.0 million), second tranche ($16.0 million), and third tranche ($10.0 million) accrue interest at a rate of 15.25%, 9.75%, and 8.5% per annum, respectively, payable in cash. This senior term loan was funded with OID of 1.0%, 3.25%, and 2.4% on the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also requires the payment of a monthly agency fee paid to our Manager of 15 basis points, 12 basis points, and 5 basis points on the outstanding principal balance of the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also has a 1.0% exit fee, and certain prepayment fees, including 1.0% for prepayments occurring within 9 months of the advance date. This senior term loan contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings, including covenants that limit the borrower's ability to incur, create, or assume certain unsecured indebtedness, and borrower's ability to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, and asset sales. This senior term loan also requires Borrower #2 to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants (measured at the end of each fiscal quarter), including a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. This senior term loan also contains customary events of default (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) including, but not limited to, the failure to make payments of interest or premium, if any, on, or principal under the loans, the failure to comply with certain covenants and agreements specified in the credit agreement, defaults in respect of certain other indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. If any event of default occurs, the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the senior term loans may become due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 3.0%, or 6.0% for material events of default, may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and our Manager may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) and take such other actions as set forth in the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations under the credit agreement would automatically become due and payable.\nThe Company measures current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d) for loans held for investment based on Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13). The Company early adopted ASU 2016-13 at formation, which introduces a new credit loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss\u201d methodology for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. CECL amended the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The allowance for credit losses (the CECL Reserve\u201d) required under ASU 2016-13 is deducted from the respective loans' amortized cost basis on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses.\nRefer to footnote 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the period March 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021, titled Loans Held for Investment, net\u201d for more information on CECL.\nRisk Management\nTo the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio of loans. Generally, with the guidance and experience of our Manager:\n \u25cf we manage our portfolio through an interactive process with our Manager and generally service our self-originated loans through our Manager's servicer; \n \u25cf we invest in a mix of floating-and fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; \n \u25cf we actively employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager's risk management tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager; and \n \u25cf we seek to manage credit risk through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, prior to origination or acquisition our Manager's investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable company analysis, supply and demand trends, shape-of-yield curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. \nRecent Developments\nUpdates to Our Loan Portfolio\nOn January 7, 2022, January 12, 2022, and January 13, 2022, we funded additional advances on three existing borrowers' credit facilities in the amounts of $4.0 million, $93,769, and $17.3 million, respectively. Additionally, on January 18, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $25.0 million, $10.0 million of which was advanced at closing. Further, on January 25, 2022, we funded an additional advance on an existing borrower's credit facility in the amount of $545,000. On February 3, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $30.0 million, all of which was advanced at closing. On March, 2, 2022, March 9, 2022, and March 17, 2022, we funded additional advances to three existing borrowers' credit facilities in the amounts of $1.8 million, $490,000, and $5.0 million, respectively. Lastly, on March 11, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $20.0 million, $17.5 million of which was advanced at closing.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nFor the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share of our common stock, relating to the period since our inception through the second quarter of 2021, which was paid on July 15, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $1,068,551.\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of our common stock, relating to the third quarter of 2021, which was paid on October 20, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,067,521.\nFor the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of our common stock, relating to the fourth quarter of 2021, which was paid on January 14, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,512,329.\nThe payment of these dividends is not indicative of our ability to pay such dividends in the future.\nCOVID-19\nThe spread of a novel strain of COVID-19 has caused significant business disruptions in the United States beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns (subject to exceptions for certain essential\u201d operations and businesses). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical cannabis companies have been deemed essential\u201d by almost all of states with legalized cannabis and stay-at-home orders. Consequently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related regulatory and private sector response on our financial and operating results for the period ended December 31, 2021 was somewhat mitigated as all of our borrowers were permitted to continue to operate during this pandemic and we have not experienced any payment default by our borrowers nor have we made any concessions on any payments due, in each case, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRegardless, the full extent of the economic impact of the business disruptions caused by COVID-19 is uncertain. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving, and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including the regulated cannabis industry. Although some of these measures have been lifted or scaled back, a recent resurgence of COVID-19 in certain parts of the world, including the United States, has resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and may lead to more restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The extent of any effect that these disruptions may have on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments, including possible impacts on the performance of our loans, general business activity, and ability to generate revenue, which cannot be determined. For more information see Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy - The current outbreak of COVID-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or cause disruption to our borrowers and their operations, and in turn our ability to continue to execute our business plan.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021\nWe commenced operations on March 30, 2021 and, therefore, have no period to compare results for the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021. Our net income allocable to our common stockholders for the period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $9.5 million or $1.47 per basic weighted average common share. Net income of approximately $9.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2021, was comprised of approximately $10.7 million of interest income, $325,648 of prepayment fee income, offset by management fees of $905,123, general and administrative expenses of 195,087, organizational expenses of $167,591, change in the provision for current expected credit losses of 147,949, professional fees of $57,458, and stock based compensation expense of $29,611. Interest income for the period ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of approximately $9.3 million of cash interest, $798,000 of PIK interest, $596,000 of OID amortization, and $61,000 of unused fee income.\nFor the period presented, we incurred Base Management Fees payable to our Manager of $905,123, which was net of a Base Management Fee Rebate of $187,028. Our Manager has incurred $244,720 in general and administrative expenses on our behalf and was reimbursed approximately $102,829 of such amount. Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreements executed by our Manager, dated June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, all Base Management Fees that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021 were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date. Additionally, Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreement executed by our Manager, dated December 31, 2021, all Incentive Compensation that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, as well as a portion of reimbursable expenses incurred during the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date.\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we recorded a provision for current expected credit loss of $147,949, or 6 basis points of our total loans held at carrying value commitment balance of approximately $235.1 million and was bifurcated between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value of $134,542 and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of $13,407. The liability is based on the unfunded portion of loan commitments over the full contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. Management considered the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the expected credit loss on the funded portion. We continuously evaluate the credit quality of each loan by assessing the risk factors of each loan.\nIn connection with the commencement of our operations, we acquired a portfolio of loans from affiliated private funds managed by an affiliate of our Manager at fair value of approximately $9.9 million. An original issue discount was recorded related to the portfolio of loans acquired at fair value. The original issue discount was approximately equivalent to $81,187 of unaccreted OID associated with the underlying loans in the portfolio, which were originated prior to March 30, 2021 in arm's-length transactions. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums on loans held for investment over the life of the related loan held for investment utilizing a method which approximates the effective interest method. In circumstances where, in management's opinion, the difference between the straight-line and effective interest methods is immaterial, the straight-line method is used.\nLoan Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio included 21 loans held for investment of approximately $197.0 million of loans receivable. The aggregate originated commitment under these loans was approximately $235.1 million and outstanding principal was approximately $200.6 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our loan portfolio had a weighted-average YTM IRR of 18.6% and was secured by real estate and, with respect to certain of our loans, substantially all assets in the borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including equipment, receivables, and licenses. YTM IRR is calculated using various inputs, including (i) cash and payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest, which is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the applicable loan, (ii) original issue discount ( OID\u201d), (iii) amortization, (iv) unused fees, and (v) exit fees. Certain of our loans have extension fees, which are not included in our YTM IRR calculations, but may increase YTM IRR if such extension options are exercised by borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any loans held for investment with floating interest rates tied to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of its portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans that pay interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin, and were subject to a prime rate floor of 3.25%. The below summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2021:\n\n 1 All loans originated prior to April 1, 2021 were purchased from affiliated entities at fair value plus accrued interest on or subsequent to April 1, 2021. \n 2 Certain loans have extension options from original maturity date. \n 3 Total Commitment excludes future amounts to be advanced at sole discretion of the lender \n 4 P\u201d = prime rate and depicts floating rate loans that pay interest at the prime rate plus a specific percentage; PIK\u201d = paid in kind interest. \n 5 P&I = principal and interest. I/O = interest only. P&I loans may include interest only periods for a portion of the loan term. \n 6 Includes OID, unused fees, and exit fees, but assumes no prepayment penalties or early payoffs. \n 8 The aggregate loan commitment to Loan #2 includes a $4.005 million initial advance, which has an interest rate of 15.25%, a second advance of $15.995 million, which has an interest rate of 9.75%, and a third advance of $10.0 million, which has an interest rate of 8.5%. The statistics presented reflect the weighted average of the terms under all advances for the total aggregate loan commitment. \n 7 Subject to a prime rate floor of 3.25%. \n 9 The aggregate loan commitment to Loan #4 includes a $5.98 million initial advance, which has an interest rate of P + 10.00%, maturing on March 31, 2022, and a second advance of $4.0 million, which has an interest rate of P + 10.00%, maturing on July 31, 2023. The statistics presented reflect the weighted average of the terms under both advances for the total aggregate loan commitment. \n 10 Subject to adjustment not below 2% if borrower receives at least two consecutive quarters of positive cash flow after the closing date. \n 11 PIK is variable with an initial rate of five percent (5.00%) per annum until Borrower's delivery to Administrative Agent and the Lenders of audited financial statements for the Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2021, at which time the PIK interest rate shall equal a rate of one percent (1.00%) if EBITDA is greater than $6,000,000; three percent (3.00%) if EBITDA is greater than $4,000,000 and less than or equal to $6,000,000; or will remain at five percent (5.00%) if EBITDA is less than $4,000,000. \n 12 The YTM IRR on Loan #20 is 124.7% due to the short term nature of the loan and amount of OID withheld during funding. \n 13 The aggregate loan commitment to Loan #6 includes $7.9 million advanced under a delayed draw term loan, which has an interest rate of P + 11.75% and 2.00% PIK, and a second commitment of $2.0 million, which has an interest rate of 39.00%. The statistics presented reflect the weighted average of the terms under all advances for the total aggregate loan commitment. \nThe following tables summarize our loans held for investment as of December 31, 2021:\n\n (1) The difference between the Carrying Value and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans consists of unaccreted original issue discount and loan origination costs \n (2) Weighted average remaining life is calculated based on the carrying value of the loans as of December 31, 2021 \nDuring the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we funded approximately $174.4 million of outstanding principal in addition to approximately $40.2 million of outstanding principal contributed from affiliates of our Manager. We received approximately $9.8 million of payments applied to outstanding principal balances, and we sold approximately $5.0 million of loans. The following table presents changes in loans held for investment at carrying value as of and for the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021:\n\nWe may make modifications to loans, including loans that are in default. Loan terms that may be modified include interest rates, required prepayments, maturity dates, covenants, principal amounts and other loan terms. The terms and conditions of each modification vary based on individual circumstances and will be determined on a case by case basis. Our Manager monitors and evaluates each of our loans held for investment and has maintained regular communications with borrowers regarding the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loans.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are Distributable Earnings, Adjusted Distributable Earnings, book value per share and dividends declared per share.\nDistributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings\nIn addition to using certain financial metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our performance, we also use Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance. Each of Distributable Earnings and Adjusted Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Distributable Earnings as, for a specified period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) Incentive Compensation, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss); provided that Distributable Earnings does not exclude, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash, (v) provision for current expected credit losses and (vi) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of such independent directors. We define Adjusted Distributable Earnings, for a specified period, as Distributable Earnings excluding certain non-recurring organizational expenses", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed above in Risk Factors\u201d and those identified below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a recently-formed commercial real estate finance company. Our primary investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over time primarily through consistent current income dividends and other distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by originating, structuring and investing in first mortgage loans and alternative structured financings secured by commercial real estate properties. Our current portfolio is comprised primarily of senior loans to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry, secured by real estate, equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations governing such borrowers. We intend to grow the size of our portfolio by continuing the track record of our business and the business conducted by our Manager and its affiliates by making loans to leading operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. There is no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective.\nWe believe that cannabis operators' limited access to traditional bank and non-bank financing has provided attractive opportunities for us to make loans to companies that exhibit strong fundamentals but require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can provide in the current regulatory environment. We believe that continued state-level legalization of cannabis for medical and adult use creates an increased loan demand by companies operating in the cannabis industry and property owners leasing to cannabis tenants. Furthermore, we believe we are differentiated from our competitors because we seek to target operators and facilities that exhibit relatively lower-risk characteristics, which we believe include generally limiting exposure to ground-up construction, lending to cannabis operators with operational and/or profitable facilities, diversification of geographies and distribution channels, among other factors. We expect cannabis lending will continue to be a principal investment strategy for the foreseeable future; however, we expect to also lend to or invest in companies or properties that are not related to the cannabis industry if they provide return characteristics consistent with our investment objective. From time to time, we may also invest in mezzanine loans, preferred equity or other forms of joint venture equity to the extent consistent with our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. We may enter into credit agreements with borrowers that permit them to incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans we extend to such companies under such credit agreements. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio includes one loan that is subordinate to a first mortgage that comprises approximately 6.9% of our total assets as of such date.\nOur Manager and its affiliates seek to originate real estate loans between $5 million and $200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms and amortization when terms exceed three years. We generally act as co-lenders in such transactions and intend to hold up to $30 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the remainder to be held by affiliates or third party co-investors. We may revise such concentration limits from time to time as our loan portfolio grows. Other investment vehicles managed by our Manager or affiliates of our Manager may co-invest with us or hold positions in a loan where we have also invested, including by means of splitting commitments, participating in loans or other means of syndicating loans. We will not engage in a co-investment transaction with an affiliate where the affiliate has a senior position to the loan held by us. To the extent that an affiliate provides financing to one of our borrowers, such loans will be working capital loans or loans that are subordinate to our loans. We may also serve as co-lenders in loans originated by third parties and, in the future, we may also acquire loans or loan participations. Loans that have a one to two year maturity are generally interest only loans.\nOur loans are secured by real estate and, in addition, when lending to owner-operators in the cannabis industry, other collateral, such as equipment, receivables, licenses or other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we seek to impose strict loan covenants and seek personal or corporate guarantees for additional protection. As of December 31, 2021, 47.6% of the loans held in our portfolio are backed by personal or corporate guarantees. We aim to maintain a portfolio diversified across jurisdictions and across verticals, including cultivators, processors, dispensaries, as well as ancillary businesses. In addition, we may invest in borrowers that have equity securities that are publicly traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange ( CSE\u201d) in Canada and/or over-the-counter in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio is comprised primarily of first mortgages to established multi-state or single-state cannabis operators or property owners. We consider cannabis operators to be established if they are state-licensed and are deemed to be operational by the applicable state regulator. We do not own any stock, warrants to purchase stock or other forms of equity in any of our portfolio companies that are involved in the cannabis industry, and we will not take stock, warrants or equity in such issuers until permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. federal laws and regulations.\nOur Manager's Investment Committee, which is comprised of John Mazarakis, Anthony Cappell, Dr. Andreas Bodmeier, and Peter Sack, advises and consults with our Manager and its investment professionals with respect to our investment strategy, portfolio construction, financing and investment guidelines and risk management and approves all of our investments. The investment professionals of our Manager have over 100 years of combined experience in private credit, real estate lending, retail, real estate acquisitions and development, investment advice, risk management, and consulting. Collectively, the investment professionals have originated, underwritten, structured, documented, managed, or syndicated over $8.0 billion in credit and real estate transactions, which includes loans to cannabis operators, loans to companies engaged in activities unrelated to cannabis, as well as commercial real estate loans. In addition, our investment professionals have substantial workout and foreclosure experience across over 80 loans amounting to over $1 billion of aggregate face value. The depth and breadth of the management and investment team allows our Manager to address all facets of our operations.\nWe are an externally managed Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us continuing to satisfy numerous asset, income and distribution tests, which in turn depend, in part, on our operating results. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us and our subsidiaries to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Additionally, because we have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and This Offering - We are an emerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make shares of our common stock less attractive to investors\u201d for certain risks related to our status as an emerging growth company.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nRevenues\nWe operate as one operating segment and are primarily focused on financing senior secured loans and other types of loans for established state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry. These loans are generally held for investment and are secured by real estate, equipment, licenses and other assets of the borrowers to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and the regulations governing such borrowers.\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on loans. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of our portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans, and 46.8% of our portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2021, none of our loans earn interest at a variable rate tied to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Interest on our loans is generally payable monthly. The principal amount of our loans and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon generally become due at the applicable maturity date. In some cases, our interest income includes a PIK component for a portion of the total interest. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable loan agreement, is accrued in accordance with the terms of such loan agreement and capitalized to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. The PIK interest added to the principal balance is typically amortized and paid in accordance with the applicable loan agreement. In cases where the loans do not amortize, the PIK interest is collected and recognized upon repayment of the outstanding principal. We also generate revenue from OID, which is also recognized as interest income from loans over the initial term of the applicable loans. Delayed draw loans may earn interest or unused fees on the undrawn portion of the loan, which is recognized as interest income in the period earned. Other fees, including prepayment fees and exit fees, are also recognized as interest income when received. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our loans and recognized as earned in accordance with GAAP.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expense is the payment of Base Management Fees and Incentive Compensation under our Management Agreement with our Manager and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses paid or incurred on our behalf, including reimbursing our Manager for a certain portion of the compensation of certain personnel of our Manager who assist in the management of our affairs, excepting only those expenses that are specifically the responsibility of our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n \u25cf organizational and offering expenses; \n \u25cf quarterly valuation expenses; \n \u25cf fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making loans and valuing loans (including third-party valuation firms); \n \u25cf fees and expenses associated with investor relations and marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); \n \u25cf federal and state registration fees; \n \u25cf any exchange listing fees; \n \u25cf federal, state and local taxes; \n \u25cf independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u25cf brokerage commissions; \n \u25cf costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; and \n \u25cf costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are a Maryland corporation that intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2021. We believe that our proposed method of operation will enable us to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, since qualification as a REIT depends on us satisfying numerous asset, income and distribution tests which depends, in part, on our operating results.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to the deduction for dividends paid. To the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income in any tax year (taking into account any distributions made in a subsequent tax year under Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code), we will pay tax at regular corporate rates on that undistributed portion. Furthermore, if we distribute less than the sum of 1) 85% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, 2) 95% of its capital gain net income for the calendar year, and 3) any undistributed shortfall from its prior calendar year (the Required Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders during any calendar year (including any distributions declared by the last day of the calendar year but paid in the subsequent year), then we are required to pay a non-deductible excise tax equal to 4% of any shortfall between the Required Distribution and the amount that was actually distributed. The 90% distribution requirement does not require the distribution of net capital gains. However, if we elect to retain any of our net capital gain for any tax year, we must notify our stockholders and pay tax at regular corporate rates on the retained net capital gain. Our stockholders must include their proportionate share of the retained net capital gain in their taxable income for the tax year, and they are deemed to have paid the REIT's tax on their proportionate share of the retained capital gain. Furthermore, such retained capital gain may be subject to the nondeductible 4% excise tax. If it is determined that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions (including capital gain dividend) for the current year from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The annual expense is calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Excise tax expense is included in the line item income tax expense. For the period from March 30, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021 we did not incur excise tax expense.\nFactors Impacting our Operating Results\nThe results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which includes the accretion and amortization of OID, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of loan, conditions in the financial markets, creditworthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, some of which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates and Effect on Net Interest Income\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and our related financing obligations.\nOur operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing. The cost of our borrowings generally will be based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase (a) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate loan assets will remain static, and (b) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating-rate loan assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Cap Risk\nWe currently own and intend to acquire in the future floating-rate assets. These are assets in which the loans may be subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which limit the amount by which the asset's interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements may not be subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps, while the interest-rate yields on our floating-rate assets would effectively be limited. In addition, floating-rate assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. This could result in our receipt of cash income from such assets in an amount that is less than the amount that we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings.\nThese factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, all of our floating rate loans have interest rate floors, and none of our loans are subject to interest rate caps.\nInterest Rate Mismatch Risk\nWe may fund a portion of our origination of loans, or of loans that we may in the future acquire, with borrowings that are based on the prime rate or a similar measure, while the interest rates on these assets may be fixed or indexed to the prime rate or another index rate. Accordingly, any increase in the prime rate will generally result in an increase in our borrowing costs that would not be matched by fixed-rate interest earnings and may not be matched by a corresponding increase in floating-rate interest earnings. Any such interest rate mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders.\nOur analysis of risks is based on our Manager's experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by our Manager and our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe that favorable market conditions, including an imbalance in supply and demand of credit to cannabis operating companies, have provided attractive opportunities for non-bank lenders, such as us, to finance commercial real estate loans and other loans that exhibit strong fundamentals but also require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can presently provide. Additionally, to the extent that additional states legalize cannabis, our addressable market will increase. We intend to continue our track record of capitalizing on these opportunities and growing the size of our portfolio.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our loans and interest receivable. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this risk by seeking to originate loans, and may in the future acquire loans, of higher quality at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring originated and acquired loans. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that could adversely impact our operating results. None of our borrowers are now, or have previously been, in default under their respective loan agreements with us.\nWe expect to be subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding our portfolio of loans. We will have exposure to credit risk on our commercial real estate loans and other targeted types of loans. Our Manager will seek to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate.\nCredit risk will also be addressed through our Manager's on-going review, and loans will be monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and cash flow on a quarterly basis.\nOur Manager or affiliates of our Manager have originated all of our loans and intend to continue to originate our loans, but we may in the future also acquire loans from time to time. Our Investment Guidelines are not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we make or that we may in the future acquire other than as necessary to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and our qualification as a REIT. Our investment decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our capital that will be invested in any individual target investment at any given time.\nOur loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 was concentrated with the top three borrowers representing approximately 34.6% of the funded principal and approximately 31.9% of the total commitments to borrowers. The largest loan represented approximately 15.0% of the funded principal and approximately 12.8% of the total commitments as of December 31, 2021.\nOur largest borrower, the borrower for Loan #2 ( Borrower #2\u201d), as of December 31, 2021 is a vertically integrated multi-state operator with operations in 14 different states. The senior term loan provided to Borrower #2 had $30.0 million outstanding principal as of December 31, 2021, of which $0 was unfunded. This senior term loan was advanced in three tranches, of which the first tranche ($4.0 million), second tranche ($16.0 million), and third tranche ($10.0 million) accrue interest at a rate of 15.25%, 9.75%, and 8.5% per annum, respectively, payable in cash. This senior term loan was funded with OID of 1.0%, 3.25%, and 2.4% on the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also requires the payment of a monthly agency fee paid to our Manager of 15 basis points, 12 basis points, and 5 basis points on the outstanding principal balance of the first tranche, second tranche, and third tranche, respectively. The loan also has a 1.0% exit fee, and certain prepayment fees, including 1.0% for prepayments occurring within 9 months of the advance date. This senior term loan contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings, including covenants that limit the borrower's ability to incur, create, or assume certain unsecured indebtedness, and borrower's ability to engage in certain mergers, consolidations, and asset sales. This senior term loan also requires Borrower #2 to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants (measured at the end of each fiscal quarter), including a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. This senior term loan also contains customary events of default (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) including, but not limited to, the failure to make payments of interest or premium, if any, on, or principal under the loans, the failure to comply with certain covenants and agreements specified in the credit agreement, defaults in respect of certain other indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. If any event of default occurs, the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the senior term loans may become due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 3.0%, or 6.0% for material events of default, may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and our Manager may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) and take such other actions as set forth in the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations under the credit agreement would automatically become due and payable.\nThe Company measures current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d) for loans held for investment based on Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13). The Company early adopted ASU 2016-13 at formation, which introduces a new credit loss methodology which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss\u201d methodology for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. CECL amended the previous credit loss model to reflect a reporting entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The allowance for credit losses (the CECL Reserve\u201d) required under ASU 2016-13 is deducted from the respective loans' amortized cost basis on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses.\nRefer to footnote 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the period March 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021, titled Loans Held for Investment, net\u201d for more information on CECL.\nRisk Management\nTo the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity (a measure of the sensitivity of the duration of a loan to changes in interest rates) risks associated with holding our portfolio of loans. Generally, with the guidance and experience of our Manager:\n \u25cf we manage our portfolio through an interactive process with our Manager and generally service our self-originated loans through our Manager's servicer; \n \u25cf we invest in a mix of floating-and fixed-rate loans to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio; \n \u25cf we actively employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing our Manager's risk management tools such as software and services licensed or purchased from third-parties and proprietary analytical methods developed by our Manager; and \n \u25cf we seek to manage credit risk through our due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition and through the use of non-recourse financing, when and where available and appropriate. In addition, with respect to any particular target investment, prior to origination or acquisition our Manager's investment team evaluates, among other things, relative valuation, comparable company analysis, supply and demand trends, shape-of-yield curves, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. \nRecent Developments\nUpdates to Our Loan Portfolio\nOn January 7, 2022, January 12, 2022, and January 13, 2022, we funded additional advances on three existing borrowers' credit facilities in the amounts of $4.0 million, $93,769, and $17.3 million, respectively. Additionally, on January 18, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $25.0 million, $10.0 million of which was advanced at closing. Further, on January 25, 2022, we funded an additional advance on an existing borrower's credit facility in the amount of $545,000. On February 3, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $30.0 million, all of which was advanced at closing. On March, 2, 2022, March 9, 2022, and March 17, 2022, we funded additional advances to three existing borrowers' credit facilities in the amounts of $1.8 million, $490,000, and $5.0 million, respectively. Lastly, on March 11, 2022, we closed and funded a loan to a new borrower for an aggregate commitment of $20.0 million, $17.5 million of which was advanced at closing.\nDividends Declared Per Share\nFor the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share of our common stock, relating to the period since our inception through the second quarter of 2021, which was paid on July 15, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $1,068,551.\nFor the period from July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of our common stock, relating to the third quarter of 2021, which was paid on October 20, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,067,521.\nFor the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of our common stock, relating to the fourth quarter of 2021, which was paid on January 14, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2021. The total amount of the cash dividend payment was approximately $4,512,329.\nThe payment of these dividends is not indicative of our ability to pay such dividends in the future.\nCOVID-19\nThe spread of a novel strain of COVID-19 has caused significant business disruptions in the United States beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns (subject to exceptions for certain essential\u201d operations and businesses). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical cannabis companies have been deemed essential\u201d by almost all of states with legalized cannabis and stay-at-home orders. Consequently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related regulatory and private sector response on our financial and operating results for the period ended December 31, 2021 was somewhat mitigated as all of our borrowers were permitted to continue to operate during this pandemic and we have not experienced any payment default by our borrowers nor have we made any concessions on any payments due, in each case, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRegardless, the full extent of the economic impact of the business disruptions caused by COVID-19 is uncertain. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving, and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly, including the regulated cannabis industry. Although some of these measures have been lifted or scaled back, a recent resurgence of COVID-19 in certain parts of the world, including the United States, has resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and may lead to more restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The extent of any effect that these disruptions may have on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments, including possible impacts on the performance of our loans, general business activity, and ability to generate revenue, which cannot be determined. For more information see Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Growth Strategy - The current outbreak of COVID-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could materially and adversely impact or cause disruption to our borrowers and their operations, and in turn our ability to continue to execute our business plan.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021\nWe commenced operations on March 30, 2021 and, therefore, have no period to compare results for the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021. Our net income allocable to our common stockholders for the period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $9.5 million or $1.47 per basic weighted average common share. Net income of approximately $9.5 million for the period ended December 31, 2021, was comprised of approximately $10.7 million of interest income, $325,648 of prepayment fee income, offset by management fees of $905,123, general and administrative expenses of 195,087, organizational expenses of $167,591, change in the provision for current expected credit losses of 147,949, professional fees of $57,458, and stock based compensation expense of $29,611. Interest income for the period ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of approximately $9.3 million of cash interest, $798,000 of PIK interest, $596,000 of OID amortization, and $61,000 of unused fee income.\nFor the period presented, we incurred Base Management Fees payable to our Manager of $905,123, which was net of a Base Management Fee Rebate of $187,028. Our Manager has incurred $244,720 in general and administrative expenses on our behalf and was reimbursed approximately $102,829 of such amount. Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreements executed by our Manager, dated June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, all Base Management Fees that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from May 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021 were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date. Additionally, Pursuant to Fee Waiver Letter Agreement executed by our Manager, dated December 31, 2021, all Incentive Compensation that would have been payable to our Manager for the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, as well as a portion of reimbursable expenses incurred during the period from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were voluntarily waived and are not subject to recoupment at a later date.\nFor the period of March 30, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, we recorded a provision for current expected credit loss of $147,949, or 6 basis points of our total loans held at carrying value commitment balance of approximately $235.1 million and was bifurcated between (i) the current expected credit loss reserve (contra-asset) related to outstanding balances on loans held at carrying value of $134,542 and (ii) a liability for unfunded commitments of $13,407. The liability is based on the unfunded portion of loan commitments over the full contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk through a current obligation to extend credit. Management considered the likelihood that funding will occur, and if funded, the expected credit loss on the funded portion. We continuously evaluate the credit quality of each loan by assessing the risk factors of each loan.\nIn connection with the commencement of our operations, we acquired a portfolio of loans from affiliated private funds managed by an affiliate of our Manager at fair value of approximately $9.9 million. An original issue discount was recorded related to the portfolio of loans acquired at fair value. The original issue discount was approximately equivalent to $81,187 of unaccreted OID associated with the underlying loans in the portfolio, which were originated prior to March 30, 2021 in arm's-length transactions. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums on loans held for investment over the life of the related loan held for investment utilizing a method which approximates the effective interest method. In circumstances where, in management's opinion, the difference between the straight-line and effective interest methods is immaterial, the straight-line method is used.\nLoan Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2021, our portfolio included 21 loans held for investment of approximately $197.0 million of loans receivable. The aggregate originated commitment under these loans was approximately $235.1 million and outstanding principal was approximately $200.6 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our loan portfolio had a weighted-average YTM IRR of 18.6% and was secured by real estate and, with respect to certain of our loans, substantially all assets in the borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including equipment, receivables, and licenses. YTM IRR is calculated using various inputs, including (i) cash and payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest, which is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance of the applicable loan, (ii) original issue discount ( OID\u201d), (iii) amortization, (iv) unused fees, and (v) exit fees. Certain of our loans have extension fees, which are not included in our YTM IRR calculations, but may increase YTM IRR if such extension options are exercised by borrowers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any loans held for investment with floating interest rates tied to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 53.2% of its portfolio was comprised of floating rate loans that pay interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin, and were subject to a prime rate floor of 3.25%. The below summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We define Distributable Earnings as, for a specified period, the net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) Incentive Compensation, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss); provided that Distributable Earnings does not exclude, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash, (v) provision for current expected credit losses and (vi) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of such independent directors. We define Adjusted Distributable Earnings, for a specified period, as Distributable Earnings excluding certain non-recurring organizational expenses"}
