( KeyStone\u201d) and Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. ( Brekford\u201d) in August 2017. KeyStone was formed in March 2016 as a holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d). On January 25, 2017, Novume (KeyStone) acquired Firestorm Solutions, LLC and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (collectively referred to as Firestorm\u201d). On October 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively referred to as Global\u201d). For narrative purposes, references to the Company and Novume include the KeyStone, Firestorm, Brekford and Global entities.\nAOC Key Solutions is based in Chantilly, Virginia and provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries. AOC Key Solutions provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. Federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries.\nFirestorm is headquartered in Roswell, Georgia and is a nationally recognized leader in crisis management, crisis communications, emergency response, and business continuity, including workplace violence prevention, cyber-breach response, communicable illness/pandemic planning, predictive intelligence, and other emergency, crisis and disaster preparedness initiatives. For example, its behavioral risk and threat assessment program, BERTHA\u00ae, positions schools, businesses and other organizations to prevent violence from occurring. This program helps our clients to identify early warning signs that may be exhibited by an individual before they are on a path to violence. BERTHA\u00ae is an integral part of an innovative school violence prevention program launched by Firestorm in partnership with the University of Alabama in November of 2017. On December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2018, Firestorm completed the acquisition of all assets of BC Management, Inc. (\"BC Management\") and Secure Education Consultants, LLC (\"SEC LLC\"), respectively. BC Management is internationally recognized as a leading executive search firm for business continuity, disaster recovery, crisis management and risk management professionals. Coupled with its staffing expertise, BC Management is a recognized leader in business continuity research with annual studies covering compensation assessments, program maturity effectiveness, event impact management reviews, IT resiliency and critical supply analyses. SEC LLC is comprised of an expert team of highly trained, former U.S. Secret Service Agents and assists clients by designing customized plans, conducting security assessments, delivering training, and responding to critical incidents.\nBrekford, headquartered in Hanover, Maryland, is a leading public safety technology service provider of fully integrated automated traffic safety enforcement, or ATSE, solutions, including speed, red light, and distracted driving cameras, as well as citation management software and secure electronic evidence storage. Brekford is also in the final stages of development of a new traffic safety product, Argos Guardian, which is expected to be lunched in the summer of 2018. The patent pending system will combine leading edge camera and radar technology with an advanced triggering mechanism to detect, capture, and record \"move over\" law violations. It will also include built-in artificial intelligence-based automated license plate reader or ALPR capability. When combined with Brekford's comprehensive citation management software suite, iP360, Argos Guardian will provide an innovative technology solution that can assist law enforcement agencies in improving the safety of officers and emergency response personnel.\nGlobal is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and provides the U.S. Department of Defense and the aerospace industry with experienced maintenance and modification specialists. Global provides specialized contract personnel, temp-to-hire professionals, direct hires, and temporary or seasonal hires to a diverse group of companies.\nIn an effort to create specific awareness about us in the Government Contracting, or GovCon, industry, we formed a subsidiary in 2017, Novume Media, to develop a television show called The Bridge -- a weekly 30-minute program featuring panel discussions and interviews with leaders from the government, business, academia and associations. The show premiered on April 2, 2017 in the Washington, DC market and the first season is available on line. We have deferred development of a second season in order to further evaluate the benefit to the Company.\nIn selective situations, we will also seek to serve as a partner or incubator for businesses where an understanding of government contracting and contacts with seasoned providers of government services or products can be instrumental to success. In making arrangements for the merger with Brekford, Novume assisted it in arranging the sale Brekford's legacy vehicle unfitting business to LB&B Associates Inc., a long-term client of AOC Key Solutions, retaining a 19.9% interest. We expect to continue our efforts to find low-risk, high-reward opportunities by using our knowledge base and strategic position to facilitate transactions that can provide financial returns without significant operating or balance sheet exposure.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Novume's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Firestorm, the Brekford Merger, the acquisition of Global and the purchase of certain assets of BC Management (described below).\nThe financial information in this section for periods prior to March 15, 2016 is for AOC Key Solutions prior to the recapitalization into KeyStone. The financial information in this section for all periods subsequent to March 15, 2016 and prior to the January 25, 2017 acquisition of Firestorm is prepared on a consolidated basis for KeyStone and AOC Key Solutions. The financial information for periods subsequent to January 25, 2017 is prepared on a consolidated basis for KeyStone, AOC Key Solutions and Firestorm. For periods subsequent to the Brekford Merger on August 28, 2017, the financial information is prepared on a consolidated basis for Novume, AOC Key Solutions, Firestorm and Brekford. For periods subsequent to the Global acquisition on October 1, 2017, the financial information is prepared on a consolidated basis for Novume, AOC Key Solutions, Firestorm, Brekford and Global.\nHistorically, the primary focus of our businesses has been on the federal government contracting and aerospace industries. We provide consulting, technical support, staffing and systems that help our clients exploit opportunities and meet challenges more efficiently and effectively than they can by relying on in-house resources alone. Our clients are typically well-established, financially-stable businesses. According to USASpending.gov, between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, the federal government in the United States spent an average of over $450 billion annually for goods and services, creating one of the largest and most stable markets in the world, and there are thousands of government contractors providing these goods and services. These contractors range from small privately-owned lifestyle companies to the Fortune 100. Since 1983, our subsidiaries have served thousands of these entities. In 2017, we provided services to 14 of the Top 100 largest federal contractors (based on their fiscal 2016 prime contracts in IT, systems integration, professional services and telecommunications) as identified by Washington Technology (https://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2017.aspx).\nA unique characteristic of the industry is that many of these companies are concentrated in a geographic territory that stretches from Southern Maryland to Northern Virginia, wrapping the nation's Capital in what is known as the Beltway. Because of the geographic concentration of these clients, there is also a large, but fragmented, concentration of service providers for these companies. Although the businesses that provide resources to the government contracting sector are diverse and highly fragmented, their clients have many common needs resulting from the basic qualifications and standard requirements inherent in the government procurement process. We believe that there is a unique opportunity for consolidation in this sector. While our immediate goal is to improve our ability to serve this sector by pooling our resources and client contacts, our ultimate objective is to expand our ability to meet our unique needs by assembling, through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, a complimentary suite of service and systems providers with demonstrated ability to satisfy the needs of this sector for high value talent and support services. In addition to the benefits of shared costs and pooled resources, we expect to benefit from the increased client involvement that targeted expansion of our market segments can provide. We would like to be recognized as the best place to go for outside help when a company must meet an unusual need, whether it involves an unusual opportunity or an unusual threat.\nWe intend to fund organic growth and add both vertical and horizontal capabilities by acquiring service providers through a market-focused and disciplined strategy. Our efforts to identify prospective target businesses will look for opportunities where the combination of resources will be additive to our existing capabilities and will not be limited to any geographic region or any particular sector of the support or services industries. A primary consideration will be to improve the level of support we provide to our existing customers, as well as carefully considered expansions of our customer base.\nWe are an established provider of outsourced services to the GovCon market that generates revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services primarily billed on an hourly rate, time-and-materials basis. Clients are typically invoiced monthly, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. In a few cases, we may enter into a fixed-fee engagement for our services. Fixed-fee engagements can be invoiced once for the entire job, or there could be several progress\u201d invoices for accomplishing various phases or reaching contractual milestones. Time-and-materials contracts represent most our client engagements and do not provide us with a high degree of predictability of future period performance.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the:\n1)\ndemand by clients for our services;\n2)\ndegree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities;\n3)\nsuccess of the sales team in generating client engagements; and\n4)\nnumber of business days in each quarter.\nThe number of business days on which revenue is generated by our staff and consultants is affected by the number of vacation days taken, as well as the number of holidays in each quarter. There are typically fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. The staff utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for services from clients. Since earnings may be affected by these seasonal variations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe federal government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30. Thus, the bulk of our revenues for 2017 were based on budget authorizations made in 2016. On March 23rd, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018 and anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years, including significant increases military procurements. The Company believes that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractors and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense products and services to the federal government. The 2018 Act also provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding. It also lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. While we anticipate an increasing demand for our services in 2018 based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018.\nAlthough the new administration has expressed a desire to reduce the federal government bureaucracy, we cannot assume that this will reduce the demand for our services. A short-term result of a program to reduce bureaucracy may be to increase privatization initiatives. Moreover, the new administration's emphasis on renewing the nation's infrastructure, which appears to enjoy broad-based support, may result in a significant long-term increase in federal procurements.\nThus, while changes and adjustments can undoubtedly be anticipated, we believe the overall outlook for the GovCon sector remains promising. This is in part due to the changing nature of the contracting process. The volume and frequency of requests for proposals has been increasing during recent years as outdated and ill-conceived programs have been eliminated in favor of higher priority programs. Moreover, Low Price Technically Acceptable contracts have increasingly fallen into disfavor as the true long-term costs of these contracts have become apparent, and a more rigorous approach to government contracting has gained favor.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Novume should be read in conjunction with the Novume audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Brekford, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto.\nRecent Acquisitions\nBC Management Acquisition\nOn December 31, 2017, Novume completed its acquisition of certain assets of BC Management. Consideration paid as part of this acquisition included: (a) $100,000 in cash, (b) 33,333 shares of Novume common stock valued at $163,332 and (c) 66,666 warrants to purchase Novume common stock valued at $123,472. As the BC Management acquisition has recently been completed, the Company is currently in the process of completing the purchase price allocation treating the BC Management acquisition as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation for BC Management is included in the balance sheet for the Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017, but results of operations for BC Management for the year ending December 31, 2017 have not been included in our statements of operations for such period. BC Management future results, however, will be included in our statement of operations for the period beginning after December 31, 2017.\nGlobal Acquisition\nOn October 1, 2017 (the Global Closing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively, the Global Entities\u201d) (the Global Merger\u201d). Consideration paid as part Global Merger included: (a) $750,000 in cash, (b) 375,000 shares of Novume common stock and (c) 240,861 shares of Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Novume Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). In addition to the merger consideration, Novume paid $365,037 to satisfy in full all of the outstanding debt of GTS and GCP at closing, except for certain intercompany debt and ordinary course debt, and amounts due under (a) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GTS and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d) and (b) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GCP and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GCP Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d and together with the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility, the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities\u201d), which will remain in effect following the consummation of the Global Merger. In connection with the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, Novume has delivered to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, general continuing guaranties dated September 29, 2017 and effective upon the Global Closing Date of the Global Merger (the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements\u201d), guaranteeing the Guaranteed Obligations of GTS and GCP (as defined in the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements) under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, and paid $175,000 in the aggregate to reduce the current borrowed amounts under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities as of the Global Closing Date.\nAs part of the Global Merger, the Company created 240,861 shares of $0.0001 par value Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). All Series B Preferred Stock was issued at a price of $10.00 per share as part of the acquisition of the Global Merger. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to quarterly cash dividends of 1.121% (4.484% per annum) per share. The Series B Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $5.00 per share. Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume.\nBrekford Acquisition\nOn August 28, 2017, the mergers by and among Novume, KeyStone, Brekford, Brekford Merger Sub, Inc. ( Brekford Merger Sub\u201d), and KeyStone Merger Sub, LLC ( KeyStone Merger Sub\u201d), were consummated (the Brekford Merger\u201d) as a result of a merger agreement (the Brekford Merger Agreement\u201d). As a result, Brekford became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and Brekford Merger Sub ceased to exist. KeyStone Merger Sub also became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and KeyStone Solutions, Inc. ceased to exist. When KeyStone Merger Sub filed its certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, it immediately effectuated a name-change to KeyStone Solutions, LLC, the name by which it is now known. For the purpose of this document any references to KeyStone are to KeyStone Solutions, Inc. prior to August 28, 2017 and to KeyStone Solutions, LLC on and after August 28, 2017.\nUpon completion of the Brekford Merger, the merger consideration was issued in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Immediately upon completion of the Brekford Merger, the pre-merger stockholders of KeyStone owned approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis, and the pre-merger stockholders of Brekford owned approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis.\nFirestorm Acquisition\nPursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA\u201d), by and among Novume, each of the Firestorm Entities, each of the Members of the Firestorm Entities (described below), and a newly-created acquisition subsidiary of Novume, Firestorm Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Firestorm Holdings\u201d), Novume acquired all of the membership interests in each of the Firestorm Entities for the following consideration:\n\u25cf\n$500,000 in cash in the aggregate paid by Novume as of the Firestorm Closing Date to the three principals (Harry W. Rhulen, Suzanne Loughlin, and James W. Satterfield, collectively the Firestorm Principals\u201d) of Firestorm. Of that aggregate amount $250,000 was paid to Mr. Satterfield, and $125,000 was paid to each of Mr. Rhulen and Ms. Loughlin;\n\u25cf\n$1,000,000 in the aggregate in the form of four unsecured, subordinated promissory notes issued by Novume payable over five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, to all the Members of the Firestorm Entities (consisting of the Firestorm Principals and Lancer Financial Group, Inc. ( Lancer\u201d)). The principal amount of the note payable to Lancer is $500,000 (the Lancer Note\u201d). The principal amount of the note payable to Mr. Rhulen is $166,666.66. The principal amount of the notes payable to each of Mr. Satterfield and Ms. Loughlin is $166,666.67. (The notes payable to Mr. Rhulen, Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Satterfield are individually referred to herein as a Firestorm Principal Note\u201d and collectively, as the Firestorm Principal Notes\u201d). The Firestorm Principal Notes are payable at an interest rate of 2% and the Lancer Note is payable at an interest rate of 7%. $907,407 was recorded to notes payable to reflect the net fair value of the notes issued due to the difference in interest rates. The Lancer Note also has a capped subordination of $7,000,000, subject to the consent of Lancer;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals was issued 162,698 (315,625 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate issuance of 488,094 (946,875 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $2.58 per share; and\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $3.60 per share.\nKey Trends, Developments and Challenges\nU.S. Government Spending and the Government Contractor Industry Generally\nOn March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018. It also anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years. The 2018 Act provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding, lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nWhile we anticipate an increasing demand for our services based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018. The administration does have some discretion to delay spending on programs previously authorized.\nImpact of Current Federal Budget on Defense Spending\nThe 2018 Act represents the largest investment in national defense in 15 years. Although the 2018 Act included a 2.4 % pay raise for military personnel it also provides for significant increases military procurements, it also provides for significant increases in military procurements. The Company believe that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractor and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense product and services to the federal government.\nThe Department of Defense is experimenting with a type of simplified acquisition process known as Other Transactional Authority (OTA). A purpose of OTA is to encourage nontraditional defense contractors to develop innovative technologies, though more traditional defense contractors can also participate. Furthermore, the 2018 Act seeks to maximize the participation of small and socio-economically diverse companies, which may increase the number of contractors offering goods and services to the federal government. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nNeoSystems Merger\nThe Company filed a Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering are to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSysems\u201d) through a forward merger under an agreement entered into on November 16, 2017. The proposed offering was for $12.5 million of Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. A significant portion of the proceeds of the offering were expected to be used in connection with the contemplated acquisition of NeoSystems. The consummation of the merger is subject to, among other things, the completion of the Qualifying Offering by February 28, 2018. We have not yet completed this offering and may elect not to complete the offering described in the S-1.\nOn March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the NeoSystems Merger Agreement\u201d) The stated basis of termination by NeoSystems was due to the Company's failure to complete a Qualifying Offering, as defined in the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, by February 28, 2018. The terms of the NeoSystems Merger Agreement provide that upon termination, the Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors, investment bankers and accountants, which shall not exceed in the aggregate $450,000. The Company reserves all rights under applicable law with respect to the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, including such notice.\nSale of Note\nOn February 13, 2018, Brekford sold a note receivable from Global Public Safety, LLC ( Global Public Safety\u201d), which it had received as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the sale of its legacy upfitting business prior to its acquisition by Novume as a result of the merger with KeyStone in 2017. On December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, the Company reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000. (See Note 17). Brekford continues to retain a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety.\nOther than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe principally derive revenues from fees for services generated on a time and materials (T&M) basis. Revenues for T&M contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by the employees or consultants at an agreed-upon rate per hour set forth in standard rate sheets or as written from time to time in contracts or purchase orders. Revenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are primarily recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature. Revenue from the sale of individual franchises is recognized when the contract is signed and collectability is assured, unless the franchisee is required to perform certain training before operations commence.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs, other marketing expenses, management and administrative personnel costs, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits for these employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of revenues for those employees who provide our services. Operating expenses also include facility costs, depreciation and amortization, professional services, legal and accounting fees, and administrative operating costs. We expense operating costs when incurred.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nConsolidated operating results for year ended December 31, 2017 include Firestorm operations for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Brekford operations for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and Global operations for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNovume Solutions, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> $22,135,818\n</td> <td> $12,128,406\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> 13,792,473\n</td> <td> 6,959,514\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> 8,343,345\n</td> <td> 5,168,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> 12,981,744\n</td> <td> 5,262,768\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> (4,638,399)\n</td> <td> (93,876)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> (213,492)\n</td> <td> (165,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td> (483,909)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> (697,401)\n</td> <td> (165,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before taxes\n</td> <td> (5,335,800)\n</td> <td> (258,955)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> 294,666\n</td> <td> 219,971\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $(5,041,134)\n</td> <td> $(38,984)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31,\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $10,007,412, or 82.5%, to $22,135,818 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12,128,406 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue attributable to Firestorm was $2,150,273 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Brekford was $914,345 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Global was $5,645,747 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $1,297,047 increase in revenue attributable to legacy Novume was due to an increase in the number, duration and dollar volume of contracts in AOC Key Solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6,832,959, or 98.2%, to $13,792,473 compared to $6,959,514 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue attributable to Firestorm was $704,668 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Brekford was $445,082 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Global was $4,983,044 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $700,165 increase in the cost of revenue of the legacy Novume was mostly attributable to increased revenue for AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3,174,453, or 61.4%, to $8,343,345 compared to $5,168,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit attributable to Firestorm was $1,445,605 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Brekford was $469,263 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Global was $662,703 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $596,882 increase in the gross profit of the legacy Novume was consistent with the increased revenue and costs of revenues at AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nThe gross profit margin was 37.7% for the fiscal year ended December 31 2017, compared to 42.6% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the gross profit margin for Firestorm, Brekford and Global, the gross profit margin for legacy Novume for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was relatively consistent at 42.7% and 42.6%, respectively. Due to the nature of staffing companies, such as Global, having greater costs of services as compared to professional services support providers such as AOC Key Solutions, the addition of Global has a natural impact of lowering the consolidated gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $7,718,976, or 146.7%, to $12,981,744 compared to $5,262,768 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Firestorm was $1,733,380 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Brekford was $890,627 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Global was $726,006 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The Company also launched a new television show in the second quarter which increased operating costs and expenses by approximately $689,226 through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. This television show airs locally in the Washington DC market. The increase of $4,551,496 in selling, general and administrative expenses of legacy Novume was primarily due to an increase in holding company salaries, professional and legal services, expenses related to acquisitions and ramp up of operations and expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements that were lower during the year ended December 31, 2016 because the Company was formed in mid-March 2016 and spending increased during the year ended December 31, 2017. As percentage of revenue, our selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 58.6% compared to 43.4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nNovume anticipates that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase, however at a reduced pace, in future periods. These increases may include costs related to hiring of personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants as well as expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance, and investor relations activities.\nOther Expense\nOther expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $697,401 compared to other expense of $165,079 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily related to a $450,000 write-down related to the fiscal year 2018 sale of the note receivable from Global Public Safety, interest expense and change in derivative liability of $60,000, offset by rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We are required to pay income taxes in certain state jurisdictions. Historically, AOC Key Solutions and GCP initially elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, neither AOC Key Solutions nor GCP paid federal corporate income tax, and in most instances state income tax, on its taxable income. AOC Key Solutions revoked its S Corporation election upon the March 15, 2016 merger with KeyStone and GCP revoked its S Corporation election upon the October 1, 2017 acquisition by Novume, and are therefore, subject to corporate income taxes. Firestorm is a single-member LLC with KeyStone as the sole member.\nThe income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $294,666 and is due primarily to the deferred tax benefit recognized related to the NOL generated in the current period as compared to an income tax benefit of $219,971 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards to utilize in the U.S. of approximately $5.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that more likely than not will not be realized. These NOLs are scheduled to begin to expire in 2036 and are grandfathered under the new tax law; thus, these NOLs are not subject to the annual 80 percent limitation. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $5,041,134 compared to a net loss of $38,984 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss per common share was $(0.46) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss margin of $(0.01) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In order to accommodate organic growth, Firestorm added both line and senior staff in 2017. In addition, the planned asset purchases of BC Management and SEC LLC added expense and took place later than anticipated, thus delaying their integration and ability to increase revenue. As such, Firestorm's expense increases exceeded its revenue increases. Brekford incurred additional marketing and R&D expenses which resulted in a net loss. Global incurred expenses related to its integration with Novume which contributed to its net loss.\nCash Flow\nNovume expects to finance its operations over the next twelve months from the date of this Form 10-K primarily through existing cash flow, supplemented as necessary by funds available through access to credit and through access to additional capital.\nThe net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> $(3,167,146)\n</td> <td> $(136,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> (289,657)\n</td> <td> (36,833)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> 2,625,428\n</td> <td> 2,393,633\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td> $(831,375)\n</td> <td> $2,220,721\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $3,167,146.

Also, the Company leases office space in Grand Rapids, Michigan under a seven-year lease expiring in October 2023.\nRent expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $605,264 and $507,815, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company is the lessor in an agreement to sublease office space in Chantilly, Virginia with an initial term of two years with eight one-year options to renew the lease through October 31, 2019. The lease provides for an annual increase in base rent and expenses of 2.90%. The initial term ended October 31, 2011 and the Company exercised the renewal options through 2014. On April 7, 2015, the lease was amended to sublease more space to the subtenant and change the rental calculation. The sublease agreement provided for an offset of $182,534 to rent expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the future obligations over the primary terms of the long-term leases expiring through 2023 are as follows:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $902,158\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 812,938\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 255,074\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,386\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,873\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> 30,393\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $2,140,822\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has funded its operations primarily through cash from operating activities from its subsidiaries, the $500,000 Avon Note (see below), and the Reg A offering. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1,957,212 and working capital of $2,750,577, as compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2,788,587 and working capital of $3,714,958 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn the Fall of 2016, the Company commenced its Regulation A Offering (the \"Reg A Offering\") of up to 3,000,000 Units. At the initial closing of the Reg A Offering, on December 23, 2016, the Company sold 301,570 Units and received aggregate gross proceeds of $3,015,700.

As reported by Novume in its Current Report on Form I-U, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2017, the Reg A Offering is now closed, effective as of the third closing.\nFollowing the Brekford Merger, all outstanding shares of KeyStone Series A Preferred Stock were exchanged for the right to receive one share of Novume Series A Preferred Stock. Novume Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.175 (7% per annum) per share, being an identical per annum percentage per share dividend as received by holders of KeyStone Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Brekford Merger. We anticipate that Novume will pay the quarterly cash dividends through cash flow from Novume, potential business growth from other acquired entities and access to additional credit or capital. The quarterly dividend payments are due within five (5) business days following the end of a quarter. On April 7, 2017, Novume paid cash dividends of $76,695 to holders of record of Novume Series A Preferred Stock as of March 30, 2017.

Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume. On December 31, 2017, the Company declared and accrued dividends of $27,001 payable to shareholders of record as of December 31,\nOperating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued payroll and related benefits. The volume of billings and timing of collections and payments affect these account balances.\nAOC Key Solutions was a party to a business loan agreement (the 2015 Loan Agreement\u201d) with Sandy Spring Bank ( SSB\u201d) dated as of September 25, 2015. The primary credit facility was an asset based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 which was due to mature on September 30, 2016. To secure its obligations under the 2015 Loan Agreement, AOC Key Solutions had granted to SSB a security interest in its accounts receivable. SSB was required to advance funds to AOC Key Solutions up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all of its accounts receivable aged 90 days or less which contained selling terms and conditions acceptable to SSB. AOC Key Solutions did not draw any funds from this credit facility in 2015. Pursuant to First Amendment to Business Loan Agreement (Asset Based), dated May 9, 2016, SSB had waived the restrictions in the 2015 Loan Agreement on AOC Key Solutions' ability to make dividends to the Company. There was no outstanding balance on the 2015 Loan Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nOn August 11, 2016, Novume entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the 2016 Line of Credit\u201d) with SSB that replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement. The 2016 Line of Credit was comprised of: 1) an asset-based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes which matured on July 31, 2017, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.50% and was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets; and 2) an optional term loan of $100,000, which was for permanent working capital, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.75%, required monthly payments of principal plus interest to fully amortize the loan over four years, was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the revolving line of credit, and was to mature on February 15, 2019.\nThe borrowing base for the 2016 Line of Credit was up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all eligible accounts receivable as defined by SSB. The borrowing base for the $100,000 term loan was fully reserved under the borrowing base for the revolving line of credit. The 2016 Line of Credit had periodic reporting requirements and balance sheet covenants, as well as affirmative and negative operational and ownership covenants. Novume was in compliance with all 2016 Line of Credit covenants at December 31, 2016. In August 2017, the Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit with SSB. As such, there was no outstanding balance on the 2016 Line of Credit at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Novume had no balances due for the 2016 Line of Credit or the 2015 Loan Agreement and there were no amounts outstanding as of the date of this Form 10-K. When Novume replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement with the 2016 Line of Credit on August 11, 2016, neither line of credit had a balance due. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nGlobal has revolving lines of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( WFB\u201d) ( the Global Wells Agreements\u201d). WFB agreed to advance to Global, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $5,000,000. Interest is payable under the Global Wells Agreements at a monthly rate equal to the Three-Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 3% plus the Margin. The Margin is 3%. Payment of the revolving lines of credit is secured by the accounts receivable of Global. The current terms of the Global Wells Agreements run through December 31, 2018, with automatic renewal terms of 12 months. WFB or Global may terminate the Global Wells Agreements upon at least 60 days' written notice prior to the last day of the current term. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $2,057,259. As part of the lines of credit agreements, Global must maintain certain financial covenants. Global met all financial covenant requirements during and as of the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn November 12, 2017, AOC Key Solutions entered into an Account Purchase Agreement and related agreements (the KSI Wells Agreement\u201d) with WFB. Pursuant to the KSI Wells Agreement, AOC Key Solutions agreed to sell and assign to WFB all of its Accounts (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code), constituting accounts arising out of sales of Goods (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or rendition of services that WFB deems to be eligible for borrowing under the KSI Wells Agreement. WFB agreed to advance to AOC Key Solutions, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $3,000,000. Interest is payable under the KSI Wells Agreement at a monthly rate equal to the Daily One Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 5%. The KSI Wells Agreement also provides for a deficit interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate plus 50% and a default interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate or deficit interest rate, plus 50%. The initial term of the KSI Wells Agreement runs through December 31, 2018 (the Initial Term\u201d), with automatic renewal terms of 12 months (the Renewal Term\u201d), commencing on the first day after the last day of the Initial Term. AOC Key Solutions may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement upon at least 60 days' prior written notice, but no more than 120 days' written notice, prior to and effective as of the last day of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, as the case may be. WFB may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement at any time and for any reason upon 30 days' written notice or without notice upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Agreement) after the expiration of any grace or cure period. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $1,606,327.\nOn March 16, 2016, Novume entered into a Subordinated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Novume agreed to issue up to $1,000,000 in subordinated debt (the \"Avon Road Note\") and warrants to purchase up to 242,493 shares of Novume's common stock ( Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The exercise price for the Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants is equal to $1.031 per share of common stock. Subordinated notes with a face amount of $500,000 and Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase 121,247 shares of Novume's common stock have been issued pursuant to the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement to Avon Road Partners, L.P. ( Avon Road\u201d), an affiliate of Robert Berman, Novume's CEO and a member of Novume's Board of Directors. The Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants had an expiration date of March 16, 2019 and qualified for equity accounting as the warrants did not fall within the scope of ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The fair value was determined to be $58,520 and was recorded as a debt discount and additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, through the maturity date of the note payable.\nThe Avon Road Note is subordinated to the Novume's 2016 Line of Credit with SSB and any successor financing facility. Simple interest accrues on the unpaid principal of the note at a rate equal to the lower of (a) 9% per annum, or (b) the highest rate permitted by applicable law. Interest is payable monthly, and the note matures on March 16, 2019. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nThe Company has generated losses since its inception in August 2017 and has relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit and the sale of a note to support cashflow from operations. The Company attributes the 2017 losses to public company corporate overhead and losses generated by some of our subsidiary operations. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of approximately $5.04 million and positive working capital of approximately $2.75 million. The Company's cash position was increased in April 2018 by the receipt of $2 million related to the issuance of a promissory note. Management believes that based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable that its forecasts, for one year from the date of the filing of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, indicate improved operations and the Company's ability to continue operations as a going concern. The Company has contingency plans to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays should operations not improve in the look-forward period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Novume did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\nRecent Events\nOn April 3, 2018, Novume and Brekford entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor (the \"Lender\") loaned to $2,000,000 to Novume and Brekford. The loan is due and payable on May 1, 2019 and bears interest at 15% per annum, with a minimum of 15% interest payable regardless of when the loan is repaid. The loan is secured by a security interest in all of the assets of Brekford. In addition, Novume agreed to issue 35,000 shares of common stock to the Lender, which shares contain piggy-back registration rights. If the shares are not so registered on the next selling shareholder registration statement, Novume is obligated to issue an additional 15,000 shares to the Lender. Upon any sale of Brekford or its assets, the Lender will be entitled to receive 7% of any proceeds received by Novume or Brekford in excess of $5 million. In addition, commencing January 1, 2020, the Lender shall be paid 7% of Brekford's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less any capital expenditures, of which this amount would be credited against proceeds from the sale of Brekford, if any.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon Novume's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the management of Novume to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Novume bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management of Novume believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form management's basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nNovume's accounting policies are further described in its historical audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Novume has identified the following critical accounting policies:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize its revenues for the provision of services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Novume principally derives revenues from fees for services generated on a project by project basis. Revenues for time-and-materials contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by our employees or consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour set forth in our standard rate sheet or as written from time to time in our contracts or purchase orders. These costs are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nRevenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature.\nThe agreements entered into in connection with a project, whether on a time-and-materials basis or firm-fixed-price basis, typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with 30-days' notice. In the event of termination, the client is contractually required to pay for all time, materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination.\nFor automated traffic safety enforcement revenue, we recognize the revenue when the required collection efforts, from citizens, are completed and posted to the municipality's account. The respective municipality is then billed depending on the terms of the respective contract, typically 15 days after the preceding month while collections are reconciled. For contracts where we receive a percentage of collected fines, revenue is calculated based upon the posted payments from citizens multiplied by our contractual percentage. For contracts where we receive a specific fixed monthly fee regardless of citations issued or collected, revenue is recorded once the amount collected from citizens exceeds the monthly fee per camera. Our fixed fee contracts typically have a revenue neutral provision whereby the municipality's payment to us cannot exceed amounts collected from citizens within a given month.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of its clients' financial condition, and Novume generally does not require collateral.\nManagement reviews accounts receivable to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. Factors considered in the determination include, among other factors, number of days an invoice is past due, client historical trends, available credit ratings information, other financial data and the overall economic environment. Collection agencies may also be utilized if management so determines.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. We also record as an additional allowance a certain percentage of aged accounts receivable, based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial conditions affecting its customer base. If actual collection experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required. After all reasonable attempts to collect an account receivable have failed, the amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance. The balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts was $24,000 and $0 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. However, actual write-offs might exceed the recorded allowance.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. This method requires an asset and liability approach for the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nManagement has evaluated the recoverability of the net deferred income tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance required with respect to such net deferred income tax assets. After considering all available facts, the Company fully reserved for its net deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that their benefits will not be realized in future periods. The Company will continue to evaluate its net deferred tax assets to determine whether any changes in circumstances could affect the realization of their future benefit. If it is determined in future periods that portions of the Company's net deferred income tax assets satisfy the realization standard, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly.\nThe tax effects of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. It is our accounting policy to account for ASC 740-10-related penalties and interest as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our evaluation revealed no uncertain tax positions that would have a material impact on the financial statements. The 2014 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS, as of December 31, 2017. Our management does not believe that any reasonably possible changes will occur within the next twelve months that will have a material impact on the financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNot Yet Adopted\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. An entity will account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the original award, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the original award and the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or liability instrument is the same as the original award. The update is effective for fiscal year 2019. The update is to be adopted prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this update but do not believe it will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the update requires only a single-step quantitative test to identify and measure impairment based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. A qualitative assessment may still be completed first for an entity to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The update is effective for fiscal year 2021 and is to be adopted on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, as part of its simplification initiatives. The update requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than deferring the recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party as is required under current GAAP. The update is effective for fiscal year 2019. The new standard will require adoption on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that this update will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. It will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; earlier adoption is permitted. In the financial statements in which the ASU is first applied, leases shall be measured and recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented with an adjustment to equity. Practical expedients are available for election as a package and if applied consistently to all leases. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, which supersedes existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and creates a single framework. Additional updates to Topic 606 issued by the FASB in 2015 and 2016 include the following:\n\u25cf\nASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new guidance such that the new provisions will now be required for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.\n\u25cf\nASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net).\n\u25cf\nASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and classifying licensing arrangements.\n\u25cf\nASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarifies the implementation guidance in a number of other areas.\nThe underlying principle is to use a five-step analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard permits the use of either a retrospective or modified retrospective application. ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-12 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. Novume has aggregated and reviewed its contracts that are within the scope of Topic 606. Based on its evaluation, Novume does not anticipate the adoption of Topic 606 will have a material impact on its balance sheet or related consolidated statements of operations, equity or cash flows. The impact of adopting Topic 606 to the Company relate to: (1) a change to franchisee agreements recorded prior to 2017; and (2) the timing of certain contractual agreements which the Company deemed as immaterial. Revenue recognition related to the Company's other revenue streams will remain substantially unchanged.\nThere are currently no other accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted that will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.\nRecently Adopted\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 is aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. Currently, GAAP requires the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. This requires a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis based on the classification of the assets and liabilities to which the underlying temporary differences relate, or, in the case of loss or credit carryforwards, based on the period in which the attribute is expected to be realized. Any valuation allowance is then required to be allocated on a pro rata basis, by jurisdiction, between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets. To simplify presentation, the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction; companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. The new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted and applied the new standard retrospectively to the prior period presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and it did not have a material impact.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that deferred debt issuance costs be reported as a reduction to long-term debt (previously reported in other noncurrent assets). We adopted ASU 2015-03 in 2016 and for all retrospective periods, as required, and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This accounting standard update applies to all entities and was effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard during fiscal year 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The standard reduces complexity in several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe do not believe that any recently issued accounting standards, in addition to those referenced above, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB, issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company adopted this standard and the impact of the adoption was not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01 provides guidance to evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are not considered a business. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017.", "summary": "- Novume, Inc.

( KeyStone\u201d) and Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. ( Brekford\u201d) in August 2017. KeyStone was formed in March 2016 as a holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d). On January 25, 2017, Novume (KeyStone) acquired Firestorm Solutions, LLC and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (collectively referred to as Firestorm\u201d). On October 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively referred to as Global\u201d). For narrative purposes, references to the Company and Novume include the KeyStone, Firestorm, Brekford and Global entities.\nAOC Key Solutions is based in Chantilly, Virginia and provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries. AOC Key Solutions provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. Federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries.\nFirestorm is headquartered in Roswell, Georgia and is a nationally recognized leader in crisis management, crisis communications, emergency response, and business continuity, including workplace violence prevention, cyber-breach response, communicable illness/pandemic planning, predictive intelligence, and other emergency, crisis and disaster preparedness initiatives. For example, its behavioral risk and threat assessment program, BERTHA\u00ae, positions schools, businesses and other organizations to prevent violence from occurring. This program helps our clients to identify early warning signs that may be exhibited by an individual before they are on a path to violence. BERTHA\u00ae is an integral part of an innovative school violence prevention program launched by Firestorm in partnership with the University of Alabama in November of 2017. On December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2018, Firestorm completed the acquisition of all assets of BC Management, Inc. (\"BC Management\") and Secure Education Consultants, LLC (\"SEC LLC\"), respectively. BC Management is internationally recognized as a leading executive search firm for business continuity, disaster recovery, crisis management and risk management professionals. Coupled with its staffing expertise, BC Management is a recognized leader in business continuity research with annual studies covering compensation assessments, program maturity effectiveness, event impact management reviews, IT resiliency and critical supply analyses. SEC LLC is comprised of an expert team of highly trained, former U.S. Secret Service Agents and assists clients by designing customized plans, conducting security assessments, delivering training, and responding to critical incidents.\nBrekford, headquartered in Hanover, Maryland, is a leading public safety technology service provider of fully integrated automated traffic safety enforcement, or ATSE, solutions, including speed, red light, and distracted driving cameras, as well as citation management software and secure electronic evidence storage. Brekford is also in the final stages of development of a new traffic safety product, Argos Guardian, which is expected to be lunched in the summer of 2018. The patent pending system will combine leading edge camera and radar technology with an advanced triggering mechanism to detect, capture, and record \"move over\" law violations. It will also include built-in artificial intelligence-based automated license plate reader or ALPR capability. When combined with Brekford's comprehensive citation management software suite, iP360, Argos Guardian will provide an innovative technology solution that can assist law enforcement agencies in improving the safety of officers and emergency response personnel.\nGlobal is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and provides the U.S. Department of Defense and the aerospace industry with experienced maintenance and modification specialists. Global provides specialized contract personnel, temp-to-hire professionals, direct hires, and temporary or seasonal hires to a diverse group of companies.\nIn an effort to create specific awareness about us in the Government Contracting, or GovCon, industry, we formed a subsidiary in 2017, Novume Media, to develop a television show called The Bridge -- a weekly 30-minute program featuring panel discussions and interviews with leaders from the government, business, academia and associations. The show premiered on April 2, 2017 in the Washington, DC market and the first season is available on line. We have deferred development of a second season in order to further evaluate the benefit to the Company.\nIn selective situations, we will also seek to serve as a partner or incubator for businesses where an understanding of government contracting and contacts with seasoned providers of government services or products can be instrumental to success. In making arrangements for the merger with Brekford, Novume assisted it in arranging the sale Brekford's legacy vehicle unfitting business to LB&B Associates Inc., a long-term client of AOC Key Solutions, retaining a 19.9% interest. We expect to continue our efforts to find low-risk, high-reward opportunities by using our knowledge base and strategic position to facilitate transactions that can provide financial returns without significant operating or balance sheet exposure.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Novume's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Firestorm, the Brekford Merger, the acquisition of Global and the purchase of certain assets of BC Management (described below).\nThe financial information in this section for periods prior to March 15, 2016 is for AOC Key Solutions prior to the recapitalization into KeyStone. The financial information in this section for all periods subsequent to March 15, 2016 and prior to the January 25, 2017 acquisition of Firestorm is prepared on a consolidated basis for KeyStone and AOC Key Solutions. The financial information for periods subsequent to January 25, 2017 is prepared on a consolidated basis for KeyStone, AOC Key Solutions and Firestorm. For periods subsequent to the Brekford Merger on August 28, 2017, the financial information is prepared on a consolidated basis for Novume, AOC Key Solutions, Firestorm and Brekford. For periods subsequent to the Global acquisition on October 1, 2017, the financial information is prepared on a consolidated basis for Novume, AOC Key Solutions, Firestorm, Brekford and Global.\nHistorically, the primary focus of our businesses has been on the federal government contracting and aerospace industries. We provide consulting, technical support, staffing and systems that help our clients exploit opportunities and meet challenges more efficiently and effectively than they can by relying on in-house resources alone. Our clients are typically well-established, financially-stable businesses. According to USASpending.gov, between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, the federal government in the United States spent an average of over $450 billion annually for goods and services, creating one of the largest and most stable markets in the world, and there are thousands of government contractors providing these goods and services. These contractors range from small privately-owned lifestyle companies to the Fortune 100. Since 1983, our subsidiaries have served thousands of these entities. In 2017, we provided services to 14 of the Top 100 largest federal contractors (based on their fiscal 2016 prime contracts in IT, systems integration, professional services and telecommunications) as identified by Washington Technology (https://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2017.aspx).\nA unique characteristic of the industry is that many of these companies are concentrated in a geographic territory that stretches from Southern Maryland to Northern Virginia, wrapping the nation's Capital in what is known as the Beltway. Because of the geographic concentration of these clients, there is also a large, but fragmented, concentration of service providers for these companies. Although the businesses that provide resources to the government contracting sector are diverse and highly fragmented, their clients have many common needs resulting from the basic qualifications and standard requirements inherent in the government procurement process. We believe that there is a unique opportunity for consolidation in this sector. While our immediate goal is to improve our ability to serve this sector by pooling our resources and client contacts, our ultimate objective is to expand our ability to meet our unique needs by assembling, through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, a complimentary suite of service and systems providers with demonstrated ability to satisfy the needs of this sector for high value talent and support services. In addition to the benefits of shared costs and pooled resources, we expect to benefit from the increased client involvement that targeted expansion of our market segments can provide. We would like to be recognized as the best place to go for outside help when a company must meet an unusual need, whether it involves an unusual opportunity or an unusual threat.\nWe intend to fund organic growth and add both vertical and horizontal capabilities by acquiring service providers through a market-focused and disciplined strategy. Our efforts to identify prospective target businesses will look for opportunities where the combination of resources will be additive to our existing capabilities and will not be limited to any geographic region or any particular sector of the support or services industries. A primary consideration will be to improve the level of support we provide to our existing customers, as well as carefully considered expansions of our customer base.\nWe are an established provider of outsourced services to the GovCon market that generates revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services primarily billed on an hourly rate, time-and-materials basis. Clients are typically invoiced monthly, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. In a few cases, we may enter into a fixed-fee engagement for our services. Fixed-fee engagements can be invoiced once for the entire job, or there could be several progress\u201d invoices for accomplishing various phases or reaching contractual milestones. Time-and-materials contracts represent most our client engagements and do not provide us with a high degree of predictability of future period performance.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the:\n1)\ndemand by clients for our services;\n2)\ndegree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities;\n3)\nsuccess of the sales team in generating client engagements; and\n4)\nnumber of business days in each quarter.\nThe number of business days on which revenue is generated by our staff and consultants is affected by the number of vacation days taken, as well as the number of holidays in each quarter. There are typically fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. The staff utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for services from clients. Since earnings may be affected by these seasonal variations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe federal government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30. Thus, the bulk of our revenues for 2017 were based on budget authorizations made in 2016. On March 23rd, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018 and anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years, including significant increases military procurements. The Company believes that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractors and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense products and services to the federal government. The 2018 Act also provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding. It also lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. While we anticipate an increasing demand for our services in 2018 based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018.\nAlthough the new administration has expressed a desire to reduce the federal government bureaucracy, we cannot assume that this will reduce the demand for our services. A short-term result of a program to reduce bureaucracy may be to increase privatization initiatives. Moreover, the new administration's emphasis on renewing the nation's infrastructure, which appears to enjoy broad-based support, may result in a significant long-term increase in federal procurements.\nThus, while changes and adjustments can undoubtedly be anticipated, we believe the overall outlook for the GovCon sector remains promising. This is in part due to the changing nature of the contracting process. The volume and frequency of requests for proposals has been increasing during recent years as outdated and ill-conceived programs have been eliminated in favor of higher priority programs. Moreover, Low Price Technically Acceptable contracts have increasingly fallen into disfavor as the true long-term costs of these contracts have become apparent, and a more rigorous approach to government contracting has gained favor.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Novume should be read in conjunction with the Novume audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Brekford, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto.\nRecent Acquisitions\nBC Management Acquisition\nOn December 31, 2017, Novume completed its acquisition of certain assets of BC Management. Consideration paid as part of this acquisition included: (a) $100,000 in cash, (b) 33,333 shares of Novume common stock valued at $163,332 and (c) 66,666 warrants to purchase Novume common stock valued at $123,472. As the BC Management acquisition has recently been completed, the Company is currently in the process of completing the purchase price allocation treating the BC Management acquisition as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation for BC Management is included in the balance sheet for the Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017, but results of operations for BC Management for the year ending December 31, 2017 have not been included in our statements of operations for such period. BC Management future results, however, will be included in our statement of operations for the period beginning after December 31, 2017.\nGlobal Acquisition\nOn October 1, 2017 (the Global Closing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively, the Global Entities\u201d) (the Global Merger\u201d). Consideration paid as part Global Merger included: (a) $750,000 in cash, (b) 375,000 shares of Novume common stock and (c) 240,861 shares of Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Novume Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). In addition to the merger consideration, Novume paid $365,037 to satisfy in full all of the outstanding debt of GTS and GCP at closing, except for certain intercompany debt and ordinary course debt, and amounts due under (a) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GTS and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d) and (b) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GCP and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GCP Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d and together with the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility, the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities\u201d), which will remain in effect following the consummation of the Global Merger. In connection with the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, Novume has delivered to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, general continuing guaranties dated September 29, 2017 and effective upon the Global Closing Date of the Global Merger (the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements\u201d), guaranteeing the Guaranteed Obligations of GTS and GCP (as defined in the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements) under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, and paid $175,000 in the aggregate to reduce the current borrowed amounts under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities as of the Global Closing Date.\nAs part of the Global Merger, the Company created 240,861 shares of $0.0001 par value Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). All Series B Preferred Stock was issued at a price of $10.00 per share as part of the acquisition of the Global Merger. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to quarterly cash dividends of 1.121% (4.484% per annum) per share. The Series B Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $5.00 per share. Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume.\nBrekford Acquisition\nOn August 28, 2017, the mergers by and among Novume, KeyStone, Brekford, Brekford Merger Sub, Inc. ( Brekford Merger Sub\u201d), and KeyStone Merger Sub, LLC ( KeyStone Merger Sub\u201d), were consummated (the Brekford Merger\u201d) as a result of a merger agreement (the Brekford Merger Agreement\u201d). As a result, Brekford became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and Brekford Merger Sub ceased to exist. KeyStone Merger Sub also became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and KeyStone Solutions, Inc. ceased to exist. When KeyStone Merger Sub filed its certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, it immediately effectuated a name-change to KeyStone Solutions, LLC, the name by which it is now known. For the purpose of this document any references to KeyStone are to KeyStone Solutions, Inc. prior to August 28, 2017 and to KeyStone Solutions, LLC on and after August 28, 2017.\nUpon completion of the Brekford Merger, the merger consideration was issued in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Immediately upon completion of the Brekford Merger, the pre-merger stockholders of KeyStone owned approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis, and the pre-merger stockholders of Brekford owned approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis.\nFirestorm Acquisition\nPursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA\u201d), by and among Novume, each of the Firestorm Entities, each of the Members of the Firestorm Entities (described below), and a newly-created acquisition subsidiary of Novume, Firestorm Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Firestorm Holdings\u201d), Novume acquired all of the membership interests in each of the Firestorm Entities for the following consideration:\n\u25cf\n$500,000 in cash in the aggregate paid by Novume as of the Firestorm Closing Date to the three principals (Harry W. Rhulen, Suzanne Loughlin, and James W. Satterfield, collectively the Firestorm Principals\u201d) of Firestorm. Of that aggregate amount $250,000 was paid to Mr. Satterfield, and $125,000 was paid to each of Mr. Rhulen and Ms. Loughlin;\n\u25cf\n$1,000,000 in the aggregate in the form of four unsecured, subordinated promissory notes issued by Novume payable over five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, to all the Members of the Firestorm Entities (consisting of the Firestorm Principals and Lancer Financial Group, Inc. ( Lancer\u201d)). The principal amount of the note payable to Lancer is $500,000 (the Lancer Note\u201d). The principal amount of the note payable to Mr. Rhulen is $166,666.66. The principal amount of the notes payable to each of Mr. Satterfield and Ms. Loughlin is $166,666.67. (The notes payable to Mr. Rhulen, Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Satterfield are individually referred to herein as a Firestorm Principal Note\u201d and collectively, as the Firestorm Principal Notes\u201d). The Firestorm Principal Notes are payable at an interest rate of 2% and the Lancer Note is payable at an interest rate of 7%. $907,407 was recorded to notes payable to reflect the net fair value of the notes issued due to the difference in interest rates. The Lancer Note also has a capped subordination of $7,000,000, subject to the consent of Lancer;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals was issued 162,698 (315,625 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate issuance of 488,094 (946,875 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $2.58 per share; and\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $3.60 per share.\nKey Trends, Developments and Challenges\nU.S. Government Spending and the Government Contractor Industry Generally\nOn March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018. It also anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years. The 2018 Act provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding, lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nWhile we anticipate an increasing demand for our services based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018. The administration does have some discretion to delay spending on programs previously authorized.\nImpact of Current Federal Budget on Defense Spending\nThe 2018 Act represents the largest investment in national defense in 15 years. Although the 2018 Act included a 2.4 % pay raise for military personnel it also provides for significant increases military procurements, it also provides for significant increases in military procurements. The Company believe that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractor and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense product and services to the federal government.\nThe Department of Defense is experimenting with a type of simplified acquisition process known as Other Transactional Authority (OTA). A purpose of OTA is to encourage nontraditional defense contractors to develop innovative technologies, though more traditional defense contractors can also participate. Furthermore, the 2018 Act seeks to maximize the participation of small and socio-economically diverse companies, which may increase the number of contractors offering goods and services to the federal government. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nNeoSystems Merger\nThe Company filed a Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering are to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSysems\u201d) through a forward merger under an agreement entered into on November 16, 2017. The proposed offering was for $12.5 million of Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. A significant portion of the proceeds of the offering were expected to be used in connection with the contemplated acquisition of NeoSystems. The consummation of the merger is subject to, among other things, the completion of the Qualifying Offering by February 28, 2018. We have not yet completed this offering and may elect not to complete the offering described in the S-1.\nOn March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the NeoSystems Merger Agreement\u201d) The stated basis of termination by NeoSystems was due to the Company's failure to complete a Qualifying Offering, as defined in the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, by February 28, 2018. The terms of the NeoSystems Merger Agreement provide that upon termination, the Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors, investment bankers and accountants, which shall not exceed in the aggregate $450,000. The Company reserves all rights under applicable law with respect to the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, including such notice.\nSale of Note\nOn February 13, 2018, Brekford sold a note receivable from Global Public Safety, LLC ( Global Public Safety\u201d), which it had received as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the sale of its legacy upfitting business prior to its acquisition by Novume as a result of the merger with KeyStone in 2017. On December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, the Company reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000. (See Note 17). Brekford continues to retain a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety.\nOther than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe principally derive revenues from fees for services generated on a time and materials (T&M) basis. Revenues for T&M contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by the employees or consultants at an agreed-upon rate per hour set forth in standard rate sheets or as written from time to time in contracts or purchase orders. Revenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are primarily recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature. Revenue from the sale of individual franchises is recognized when the contract is signed and collectability is assured, unless the franchisee is required to perform certain training before operations commence.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs, other marketing expenses, management and administrative personnel costs, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits for these employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of revenues for those employees who provide our services. Operating expenses also include facility costs, depreciation and amortization, professional services, legal and accounting fees, and administrative operating costs. We expense operating costs when incurred.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nConsolidated operating results for year ended December 31, 2017 include Firestorm operations for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Brekford operations for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and Global operations for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNovume Solutions, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31,\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $10,007,412, or 82.5%, to $22,135,818 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12,128,406 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue attributable to Firestorm was $2,150,273 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Brekford was $914,345 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Global was $5,645,747 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $1,297,047 increase in revenue attributable to legacy Novume was due to an increase in the number, duration and dollar volume of contracts in AOC Key Solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6,832,959, or 98.2%, to $13,792,473 compared to $6,959,514 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue attributable to Firestorm was $704,668 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Brekford was $445,082 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Global was $4,983,044 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $700,165 increase in the cost of revenue of the legacy Novume was mostly attributable to increased revenue for AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3,174,453, or 61.4%, to $8,343,345 compared to $5,168,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit attributable to Firestorm was $1,445,605 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Brekford was $469,263 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Global was $662,703 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $596,882 increase in the gross profit of the legacy Novume was consistent with the increased revenue and costs of revenues at AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nThe gross profit margin was 37.7% for the fiscal year ended December 31 2017, compared to 42.6% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the gross profit margin for Firestorm, Brekford and Global, the gross profit margin for legacy Novume for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was relatively consistent at 42.7% and 42.6%, respectively. Due to the nature of staffing companies, such as Global, having greater costs of services as compared to professional services support providers such as AOC Key Solutions, the addition of Global has a natural impact of lowering the consolidated gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $7,718,976, or 146.7%, to $12,981,744 compared to $5,262,768 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Firestorm was $1,733,380 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Brekford was $890,627 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Global was $726,006 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The Company also launched a new television show in the second quarter which increased operating costs and expenses by approximately $689,226 through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. This television show airs locally in the Washington DC market. The increase of $4,551,496 in selling, general and administrative expenses of legacy Novume was primarily due to an increase in holding company salaries, professional and legal services, expenses related to acquisitions and ramp up of operations and expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements that were lower during the year ended December 31, 2016 because the Company was formed in mid-March 2016 and spending increased during the year ended December 31, 2017. As percentage of revenue, our selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 58.6% compared to 43.4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nNovume anticipates that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase, however at a reduced pace, in future periods. These increases may include costs related to hiring of personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants as well as expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance, and investor relations activities.\nOther Expense\nOther expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $697,401 compared to other expense of $165,079 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily related to a $450,000 write-down related to the fiscal year 2018 sale of the note receivable from Global Public Safety, interest expense and change in derivative liability of $60,000, offset by rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We are required to pay income taxes in certain state jurisdictions. Historically, AOC Key Solutions and GCP initially elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, neither AOC Key Solutions nor GCP paid federal corporate income tax, and in most instances state income tax, on its taxable income. AOC Key Solutions revoked its S Corporation election upon the March 15, 2016 merger with KeyStone and GCP revoked its S Corporation election upon the October 1, 2017 acquisition by Novume, and are therefore, subject to corporate income taxes. Firestorm is a single-member LLC with KeyStone as the sole member.\nThe income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $294,666 and is due primarily to the deferred tax benefit recognized related to the NOL generated in the current period as compared to an income tax benefit of $219,971 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards to utilize in the U.S. of approximately $5.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that more likely than not will not be realized. These NOLs are scheduled to begin to expire in 2036 and are grandfathered under the new tax law; thus, these NOLs are not subject to the annual 80 percent limitation. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $5,041,134 compared to a net loss of $38,984 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss per common share was $(0.46) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss margin of $(0.01) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In order to accommodate organic growth, Firestorm added both line and senior staff in 2017. In addition, the planned asset purchases of BC Management and SEC LLC added expense and took place later than anticipated, thus delaying their integration and ability to increase revenue. As such, Firestorm's expense increases exceeded its revenue increases. Brekford incurred additional marketing and R&D expenses which resulted in a net loss. Global incurred expenses related to its integration with Novume which contributed to its net loss.\nCash Flow\nNovume expects to finance its operations over the next twelve months from the date of this Form 10-K primarily through existing cash flow, supplemented as necessary by funds available through access to credit and through access to additional capital.\nThe net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows:\n\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $3,167,146. Cash was used primarily to fund our loss from operations of $5,041,134 and was affected by the increase in current liabilities of $730,720, offset by an increase in current assets of $350,138. Novume also incurred non-cash expenses of $1,493,405 including depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, note receivable write-down, share-based compensation, warrant expense and financing related costs.

The sublease agreement provided for an offset of $182,534 to rent expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the future obligations over the primary terms of the long-term leases expiring through 2023 are as follows:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has funded its operations primarily through cash from operating activities from its subsidiaries, the $500,000 Avon Note (see below), and the Reg A offering. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1,957,212 and working capital of $2,750,577, as compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2,788,587 and working capital of $3,714,958 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn the Fall of 2016, the Company commenced its Regulation A Offering (the \"Reg A Offering\") of up to 3,000,000 Units.

As reported by Novume in its Current Report on Form I-U, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2017, the Reg A Offering is now closed, effective as of the third closing.\nFollowing the Brekford Merger, all outstanding shares of KeyStone Series A Preferred Stock were exchanged for the right to receive one share of Novume Series A Preferred Stock. Novume Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.175 (7% per annum) per share, being an identical per annum percentage per share dividend as received by holders of KeyStone Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Brekford Merger. We anticipate that Novume will pay the quarterly cash dividends through cash flow from Novume, potential business growth from other acquired entities and access to additional credit or capital. The quarterly dividend payments are due within five (5) business days following the end of a quarter. On April 7, 2017, Novume paid cash dividends of $76,695 to holders of record of Novume Series A Preferred Stock as of March 30, 2017.

All Series B Preferred Stock was issued at a price of $10.00 per share as part of the acquisition of the Global Merger. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to quarterly cash dividends of 1.121% (4.484% per annum) per share. The Series B Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $5.00 per share. Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume. On December 31, 2017, the Company declared and accrued dividends of $27,001 payable to shareholders of record as of December 31,\nOperating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued payroll and related benefits. The volume of billings and timing of collections and payments affect these account balances.\nAOC Key Solutions was a party to a business loan agreement (the 2015 Loan Agreement\u201d) with Sandy Spring Bank ( SSB\u201d) dated as of September 25, 2015. The primary credit facility was an asset based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 which was due to mature on September 30, 2016. To secure its obligations under the 2015 Loan Agreement, AOC Key Solutions had granted to SSB a security interest in its accounts receivable. SSB was required to advance funds to AOC Key Solutions up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all of its accounts receivable aged 90 days or less which contained selling terms and conditions acceptable to SSB. AOC Key Solutions did not draw any funds from this credit facility in 2015. Pursuant to First Amendment to Business Loan Agreement (Asset Based), dated May 9, 2016, SSB had waived the restrictions in the 2015 Loan Agreement on AOC Key Solutions' ability to make dividends to the Company. There was no outstanding balance on the 2015 Loan Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nOn August 11, 2016, Novume entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the 2016 Line of Credit\u201d) with SSB that replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement. The 2016 Line of Credit was comprised of: 1) an asset-based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes which matured on July 31, 2017, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.50% and was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets; and 2) an optional term loan of $100,000, which was for permanent working capital, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.75%, required monthly payments of principal plus interest to fully amortize the loan over four years, was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the revolving line of credit, and was to mature on February 15, 2019.\nThe borrowing base for the 2016 Line of Credit was up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all eligible accounts receivable as defined by SSB. The borrowing base for the $100,000 term loan was fully reserved under the borrowing base for the revolving line of credit. The 2016 Line of Credit had periodic reporting requirements and balance sheet covenants, as well as affirmative and negative operational and ownership covenants. Novume was in compliance with all 2016 Line of Credit covenants at December 31, 2016. In August 2017, the Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit with SSB. As such, there was no outstanding balance on the 2016 Line of Credit at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Novume had no balances due for the 2016 Line of Credit or the 2015 Loan Agreement and there were no amounts outstanding as of the date of this Form 10-K. When Novume replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement with the 2016 Line of Credit on August 11, 2016, neither line of credit had a balance due. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nGlobal has revolving lines of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( WFB\u201d) ( the Global Wells Agreements\u201d). WFB agreed to advance to Global, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $5,000,000. Interest is payable under the Global Wells Agreements at a monthly rate equal to the Three-Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 3% plus the Margin. The Margin is 3%. Payment of the revolving lines of credit is secured by the accounts receivable of Global. The current terms of the Global Wells Agreements run through December 31, 2018, with automatic renewal terms of 12 months. WFB or Global may terminate the Global Wells Agreements upon at least 60 days' written notice prior to the last day of the current term. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $2,057,259. As part of the lines of credit agreements, Global must maintain certain financial covenants. Global met all financial covenant requirements during and as of the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn November 12, 2017, AOC Key Solutions entered into an Account Purchase Agreement and related agreements (the KSI Wells Agreement\u201d) with WFB. Pursuant to the KSI Wells Agreement, AOC Key Solutions agreed to sell and assign to WFB all of its Accounts (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code), constituting accounts arising out of sales of Goods (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or rendition of services that WFB deems to be eligible for borrowing under the KSI Wells Agreement. WFB agreed to advance to AOC Key Solutions, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $3,000,000. Interest is payable under the KSI Wells Agreement at a monthly rate equal to the Daily One Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 5%. The KSI Wells Agreement also provides for a deficit interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate plus 50% and a default interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate or deficit interest rate, plus 50%. The initial term of the KSI Wells Agreement runs through December 31, 2018 (the Initial Term\u201d), with automatic renewal terms of 12 months (the Renewal Term\u201d), commencing on the first day after the last day of the Initial Term. AOC Key Solutions may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement upon at least 60 days' prior written notice, but no more than 120 days' written notice, prior to and effective as of the last day of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, as the case may be. WFB may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement at any time and for any reason upon 30 days' written notice or without notice upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Agreement) after the expiration of any grace or cure period. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $1,606,327.\nOn March 16, 2016, Novume entered into a Subordinated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Novume agreed to issue up to $1,000,000 in subordinated debt (the \"Avon Road Note\") and warrants to purchase up to 242,493 shares of Novume's common stock ( Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The exercise price for the Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants is equal to $1.031 per share of common stock. Subordinated notes with a face amount of $500,000 and Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase 121,247 shares of Novume's common stock have been issued pursuant to the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement to Avon Road Partners, L.P. ( Avon Road\u201d), an affiliate of Robert Berman, Novume's CEO and a member of Novume's Board of Directors. The Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants had an expiration date of March 16, 2019 and qualified for equity accounting as the warrants did not fall within the scope of ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The fair value was determined to be $58,520 and was recorded as a debt discount and additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, through the maturity date of the note payable.\nThe Avon Road Note is subordinated to the Novume's 2016 Line of Credit with SSB and any successor financing facility. Simple interest accrues on the unpaid principal of the note at a rate equal to the lower of (a) 9% per annum, or (b) the highest rate permitted by applicable law. Interest is payable monthly, and the note matures on March 16, 2019. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nThe Company has generated losses since its inception in August 2017 and has relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit and the sale of a note to support cashflow from operations. The Company attributes the 2017 losses to public company corporate overhead and losses generated by some of our subsidiary operations. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of approximately $5.04 million and positive working capital of approximately $2.75 million. The Company's cash position was increased in April 2018 by the receipt of $2 million related to the issuance of a promissory note. Management believes that based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable that its forecasts, for one year from the date of the filing of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, indicate improved operations and the Company's ability to continue operations as a going concern. The Company has contingency plans to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays should operations not improve in the look-forward period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Novume did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\nRecent Events\nOn April 3, 2018, Novume and Brekford entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor (the \"Lender\") loaned to $2,000,000 to Novume and Brekford. The loan is due and payable on May 1, 2019 and bears interest at 15% per annum, with a minimum of 15% interest payable regardless of when the loan is repaid. The loan is secured by a security interest in all of the assets of Brekford. In addition, Novume agreed to issue 35,000 shares of common stock to the Lender, which shares contain piggy-back registration rights. If the shares are not so registered on the next selling shareholder registration statement, Novume is obligated to issue an additional 15,000 shares to the Lender. Upon any sale of Brekford or its assets, the Lender will be entitled to receive 7% of any proceeds received by Novume or Brekford in excess of $5 million. In addition, commencing January 1, 2020, the Lender shall be paid 7% of Brekford's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less any capital expenditures, of which this amount would be credited against proceeds from the sale of Brekford, if any.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon Novume's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the management of Novume to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Novume bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management of Novume believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form management's basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nNovume's accounting policies are further described in its historical audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Novume has identified the following critical accounting policies:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize its revenues for the provision of services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Novume principally derives revenues from fees for services generated on a project by project basis. Revenues for time-and-materials contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by our employees or consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour set forth in our standard rate sheet or as written from time to time in our contracts or purchase orders. These costs are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nRevenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature.\nThe agreements entered into in connection with a project, whether on a time-and-materials basis or firm-fixed-price basis, typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with 30-days' notice. In the event of termination, the client is contractually required to pay for all time, materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination.\nFor automated traffic safety enforcement revenue, we recognize the revenue when the required collection efforts, from citizens, are completed and posted to the municipality's account. The respective municipality is then billed depending on the terms of the respective contract, typically 15 days after the preceding month while collections are reconciled. For contracts where we receive a percentage of collected fines, revenue is calculated based upon the posted payments from citizens multiplied by our contractual percentage. For contracts where we receive a specific fixed monthly fee regardless of citations issued or collected, revenue is recorded once the amount collected from citizens exceeds the monthly fee per camera. Our fixed fee contracts typically have a revenue neutral provision whereby the municipality's payment to us cannot exceed amounts collected from citizens within a given month.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of its clients' financial condition, and Novume generally does not require collateral.\nManagement reviews accounts receivable to determine if any receivables will potentially be", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

( KeyStone\u201d) and Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. ( Brekford\u201d) in August 2017. KeyStone was formed in March 2016 as a holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d). On January 25, 2017, Novume (KeyStone) acquired Firestorm Solutions, LLC and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (collectively referred to as Firestorm\u201d). On October 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively referred to as Global\u201d). For narrative purposes, references to the Company and Novume include the KeyStone, Firestorm, Brekford and Global entities.\nAOC Key Solutions is based in Chantilly, Virginia and provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries. AOC Key Solutions provides consulting and technical support services to assist clients seeking U.S. Federal government contracts in the technology, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace industries.\nFirestorm is headquartered in Roswell, Georgia and is a nationally recognized leader in crisis management, crisis communications, emergency response, and business continuity, including workplace violence prevention, cyber-breach response, communicable illness/pandemic planning, predictive intelligence, and other emergency, crisis and disaster preparedness initiatives. For example, its behavioral risk and threat assessment program, BERTHA\u00ae, positions schools, businesses and other organizations to prevent violence from occurring. This program helps our clients to identify early warning signs that may be exhibited by an individual before they are on a path to violence. BERTHA\u00ae is an integral part of an innovative school violence prevention program launched by Firestorm in partnership with the University of Alabama in November of 2017. On December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2018, Firestorm completed the acquisition of all assets of BC Management, Inc. (\"BC Management\") and Secure Education Consultants, LLC (\"SEC LLC\"), respectively. BC Management is internationally recognized as a leading executive search firm for business continuity, disaster recovery, crisis management and risk management professionals. Coupled with its staffing expertise, BC Management is a recognized leader in business continuity research with annual studies covering compensation assessments, program maturity effectiveness, event impact management reviews, IT resiliency and critical supply analyses. SEC LLC is comprised of an expert team of highly trained, former U.S. Secret Service Agents and assists clients by designing customized plans, conducting security assessments, delivering training, and responding to critical incidents.\nBrekford, headquartered in Hanover, Maryland, is a leading public safety technology service provider of fully integrated automated traffic safety enforcement, or ATSE, solutions, including speed, red light, and distracted driving cameras, as well as citation management software and secure electronic evidence storage. Brekford is also in the final stages of development of a new traffic safety product, Argos Guardian, which is expected to be lunched in the summer of 2018. The patent pending system will combine leading edge camera and radar technology with an advanced triggering mechanism to detect, capture, and record \"move over\" law violations. It will also include built-in artificial intelligence-based automated license plate reader or ALPR capability. When combined with Brekford's comprehensive citation management software suite, iP360, Argos Guardian will provide an innovative technology solution that can assist law enforcement agencies in improving the safety of officers and emergency response personnel.\nGlobal is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and provides the U.S. Department of Defense and the aerospace industry with experienced maintenance and modification specialists. Global provides specialized contract personnel, temp-to-hire professionals, direct hires, and temporary or seasonal hires to a diverse group of companies.\nIn an effort to create specific awareness about us in the Government Contracting, or GovCon, industry, we formed a subsidiary in 2017, Novume Media, to develop a television show called The Bridge -- a weekly 30-minute program featuring panel discussions and interviews with leaders from the government, business, academia and associations. The show premiered on April 2, 2017 in the Washington, DC market and the first season is available on line. We have deferred development of a second season in order to further evaluate the benefit to the Company.\nIn selective situations, we will also seek to serve as a partner or incubator for businesses where an understanding of government contracting and contacts with seasoned providers of government services or products can be instrumental to success. In making arrangements for the merger with Brekford, Novume assisted it in arranging the sale Brekford's legacy vehicle unfitting business to LB&B Associates Inc., a long-term client of AOC Key Solutions, retaining a 19.9% interest. We expect to continue our efforts to find low-risk, high-reward opportunities by using our knowledge base and strategic position to facilitate transactions that can provide financial returns without significant operating or balance sheet exposure.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Novume's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Firestorm, the Brekford Merger, the acquisition of Global and the purchase of certain assets of BC Management (described below).\nThe financial information in this section for periods prior to March 15, 2016 is for AOC Key Solutions prior to the recapitalization into KeyStone.

According to USASpending.gov, between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, the federal government in the United States spent an average of over $450 billion annually for goods and services, creating one of the largest and most stable markets in the world, and there are thousands of government contractors providing these goods and services. These contractors range from small privately-owned lifestyle companies to the Fortune 100. Since 1983, our subsidiaries have served thousands of these entities. In 2017, we provided services to 14 of the Top 100 largest federal contractors (based on their fiscal 2016 prime contracts in IT, systems integration, professional services and telecommunications) as identified by Washington Technology (https://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2017.aspx).\nA unique characteristic of the industry is that many of these companies are concentrated in a geographic territory that stretches from Southern Maryland to Northern Virginia, wrapping the nation's Capital in what is known as the Beltway. Because of the geographic concentration of these clients, there is also a large, but fragmented, concentration of service providers for these companies. Although the businesses that provide resources to the government contracting sector are diverse and highly fragmented, their clients have many common needs resulting from the basic qualifications and standard requirements inherent in the government procurement process. We believe that there is a unique opportunity for consolidation in this sector. While our immediate goal is to improve our ability to serve this sector by pooling our resources and client contacts, our ultimate objective is to expand our ability to meet our unique needs by assembling, through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, a complimentary suite of service and systems providers with demonstrated ability to satisfy the needs of this sector for high value talent and support services. In addition to the benefits of shared costs and pooled resources, we expect to benefit from the increased client involvement that targeted expansion of our market segments can provide. We would like to be recognized as the best place to go for outside help when a company must meet an unusual need, whether it involves an unusual opportunity or an unusual threat.\nWe intend to fund organic growth and add both vertical and horizontal capabilities by acquiring service providers through a market-focused and disciplined strategy. Our efforts to identify prospective target businesses will look for opportunities where the combination of resources will be additive to our existing capabilities and will not be limited to any geographic region or any particular sector of the support or services industries. A primary consideration will be to improve the level of support we provide to our existing customers, as well as carefully considered expansions of our customer base.\nWe are an established provider of outsourced services to the GovCon market that generates revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services primarily billed on an hourly rate, time-and-materials basis. Clients are typically invoiced monthly, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. In a few cases, we may enter into a fixed-fee engagement for our services. Fixed-fee engagements can be invoiced once for the entire job, or there could be several progress\u201d invoices for accomplishing various phases or reaching contractual milestones. Time-and-materials contracts represent most our client engagements and do not provide us with a high degree of predictability of future period performance.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the:\n1)\ndemand by clients for our services;\n2)\ndegree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities;\n3)\nsuccess of the sales team in generating client engagements; and\n4)\nnumber of business days in each quarter.\nThe number of business days on which revenue is generated by our staff and consultants is affected by the number of vacation days taken, as well as the number of holidays in each quarter. There are typically fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. The staff utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for services from clients. Since earnings may be affected by these seasonal variations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe federal government fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on September 30. Thus, the bulk of our revenues for 2017 were based on budget authorizations made in 2016. On March 23rd, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018 and anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years, including significant increases military procurements. The Company believes that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractors and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense products and services to the federal government. The 2018 Act also provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding. It also lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. While we anticipate an increasing demand for our services in 2018 based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018.\nAlthough the new administration has expressed a desire to reduce the federal government bureaucracy, we cannot assume that this will reduce the demand for our services. A short-term result of a program to reduce bureaucracy may be to increase privatization initiatives. Moreover, the new administration's emphasis on renewing the nation's infrastructure, which appears to enjoy broad-based support, may result in a significant long-term increase in federal procurements.\nThus, while changes and adjustments can undoubtedly be anticipated, we believe the overall outlook for the GovCon sector remains promising. This is in part due to the changing nature of the contracting process. The volume and frequency of requests for proposals has been increasing during recent years as outdated and ill-conceived programs have been eliminated in favor of higher priority programs. Moreover, Low Price Technically Acceptable contracts have increasingly fallen into disfavor as the true long-term costs of these contracts have become apparent, and a more rigorous approach to government contracting has gained favor.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Novume should be read in conjunction with the Novume audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Brekford, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto.\nRecent Acquisitions\nBC Management Acquisition\nOn December 31, 2017, Novume completed its acquisition of certain assets of BC Management. Consideration paid as part of this acquisition included: (a) $100,000 in cash, (b) 33,333 shares of Novume common stock valued at $163,332 and (c) 66,666 warrants to purchase Novume common stock valued at $123,472. As the BC Management acquisition has recently been completed, the Company is currently in the process of completing the purchase price allocation treating the BC Management acquisition as a business combination. The preliminary purchase price allocation for BC Management is included in the balance sheet for the Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017, but results of operations for BC Management for the year ending December 31, 2017 have not been included in our statements of operations for such period. BC Management future results, however, will be included in our statement of operations for the period beginning after December 31, 2017.\nGlobal Acquisition\nOn October 1, 2017 (the Global Closing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP) (collectively, the Global Entities\u201d) (the Global Merger\u201d). Consideration paid as part Global Merger included: (a) $750,000 in cash, (b) 375,000 shares of Novume common stock and (c) 240,861 shares of Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Novume Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). In addition to the merger consideration, Novume paid $365,037 to satisfy in full all of the outstanding debt of GTS and GCP at closing, except for certain intercompany debt and ordinary course debt, and amounts due under (a) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GTS and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d) and (b) the Secured Account Purchase Agreement dated August 22, 2012 by and between GCP and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the GCP Wells Fargo Credit Facility\u201d and together with the GTS Wells Fargo Credit Facility, the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities\u201d), which will remain in effect following the consummation of the Global Merger. In connection with the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, Novume has delivered to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, general continuing guaranties dated September 29, 2017 and effective upon the Global Closing Date of the Global Merger (the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements\u201d), guaranteeing the Guaranteed Obligations of GTS and GCP (as defined in the Wells Fargo Guaranty Agreements) under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, and paid $175,000 in the aggregate to reduce the current borrowed amounts under the Wells Fargo Credit Facilities as of the Global Closing Date.\nAs part of the Global Merger, the Company created 240,861 shares of $0.0001 par value Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d). All Series B Preferred Stock was issued at a price of $10.00 per share as part of the acquisition of the Global Merger. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to quarterly cash dividends of 1.121% (4.484% per annum) per share. The Series B Preferred Stock has a conversion price of $5.00 per share. Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume.\nBrekford Acquisition\nOn August 28, 2017, the mergers by and among Novume, KeyStone, Brekford, Brekford Merger Sub, Inc. ( Brekford Merger Sub\u201d), and KeyStone Merger Sub, LLC ( KeyStone Merger Sub\u201d), were consummated (the Brekford Merger\u201d) as a result of a merger agreement (the Brekford Merger Agreement\u201d). As a result, Brekford became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and Brekford Merger Sub ceased to exist. KeyStone Merger Sub also became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Novume, and KeyStone Solutions, Inc. ceased to exist. When KeyStone Merger Sub filed its certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, it immediately effectuated a name-change to KeyStone Solutions, LLC, the name by which it is now known. For the purpose of this document any references to KeyStone are to KeyStone Solutions, Inc. prior to August 28, 2017 and to KeyStone Solutions, LLC on and after August 28, 2017.\nUpon completion of the Brekford Merger, the merger consideration was issued in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Immediately upon completion of the Brekford Merger, the pre-merger stockholders of KeyStone owned approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis, and the pre-merger stockholders of Brekford owned approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Novume on a fully-diluted basis.\nFirestorm Acquisition\nPursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA\u201d), by and among Novume, each of the Firestorm Entities, each of the Members of the Firestorm Entities (described below), and a newly-created acquisition subsidiary of Novume, Firestorm Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Firestorm Holdings\u201d), Novume acquired all of the membership interests in each of the Firestorm Entities for the following consideration:\n\u25cf\n$500,000 in cash in the aggregate paid by Novume as of the Firestorm Closing Date to the three principals (Harry W. Rhulen, Suzanne Loughlin, and James W. Satterfield, collectively the Firestorm Principals\u201d) of Firestorm. Of that aggregate amount $250,000 was paid to Mr. Satterfield, and $125,000 was paid to each of Mr. Rhulen and Ms. Loughlin;\n\u25cf\n$1,000,000 in the aggregate in the form of four unsecured, subordinated promissory notes issued by Novume payable over five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, to all the Members of the Firestorm Entities (consisting of the Firestorm Principals and Lancer Financial Group, Inc. ( Lancer\u201d)). The principal amount of the note payable to Lancer is $500,000 (the Lancer Note\u201d). The principal amount of the note payable to Mr. Rhulen is $166,666.66. The principal amount of the notes payable to each of Mr. Satterfield and Ms. Loughlin is $166,666.67. (The notes payable to Mr. Rhulen, Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Satterfield are individually referred to herein as a Firestorm Principal Note\u201d and collectively, as the Firestorm Principal Notes\u201d). The Firestorm Principal Notes are payable at an interest rate of 2% and the Lancer Note is payable at an interest rate of 7%. $907,407 was recorded to notes payable to reflect the net fair value of the notes issued due to the difference in interest rates. The Lancer Note also has a capped subordination of $7,000,000, subject to the consent of Lancer;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals was issued 162,698 (315,625 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate issuance of 488,094 (946,875 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock;\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $2.58 per share; and\n\u25cf\nEach of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) Novume Common Shares, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $3.60 per share.\nKey Trends, Developments and Challenges\nU.S. Government Spending and the Government Contractor Industry Generally\nOn March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the 2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018. It also anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years. The 2018 Act provides more than $2.3 billion in new funding for threat identification, mental health, training, and school safety programs at the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. The legislation also lifts statutory budget caps and increases funding for emergency disaster aid funding, lifts the debt ceiling and extends certain health care and tax authorizations. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nWhile we anticipate an increasing demand for our services based upon an expected increase in the volume of federal government spending and as our clients elect to outsource their bid and proposal activities, it is still not clear how government spending will be impacted beyond 2018. The administration does have some discretion to delay spending on programs previously authorized.\nImpact of Current Federal Budget on Defense Spending\nThe 2018 Act represents the largest investment in national defense in 15 years. Although the 2018 Act included a 2.4 % pay raise for military personnel it also provides for significant increases military procurements, it also provides for significant increases in military procurements. The Company believe that increased defense spending will flow down to government contractor and provide them with new opportunities to offer national defense product and services to the federal government.\nThe Department of Defense is experimenting with a type of simplified acquisition process known as Other Transactional Authority (OTA). A purpose of OTA is to encourage nontraditional defense contractors to develop innovative technologies, though more traditional defense contractors can also participate. Furthermore, the 2018 Act seeks to maximize the participation of small and socio-economically diverse companies, which may increase the number of contractors offering goods and services to the federal government. We believe that these increases in federal funding will increase demand for our services.\nNeoSystems Merger\nThe Company filed a Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering are to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSysems\u201d) through a forward merger under an agreement entered into on November 16, 2017. The proposed offering was for $12.5 million of Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. A significant portion of the proceeds of the offering were expected to be used in connection with the contemplated acquisition of NeoSystems. The consummation of the merger is subject to, among other things, the completion of the Qualifying Offering by February 28, 2018. We have not yet completed this offering and may elect not to complete the offering described in the S-1.\nOn March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the NeoSystems Merger Agreement\u201d) The stated basis of termination by NeoSystems was due to the Company's failure to complete a Qualifying Offering, as defined in the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, by February 28, 2018. The terms of the NeoSystems Merger Agreement provide that upon termination, the Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors, investment bankers and accountants, which shall not exceed in the aggregate $450,000. The Company reserves all rights under applicable law with respect to the NeoSystems Merger Agreement, including such notice.\nSale of Note\nOn February 13, 2018, Brekford sold a note receivable from Global Public Safety, LLC ( Global Public Safety\u201d), which it had received as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the sale of its legacy upfitting business prior to its acquisition by Novume as a result of the merger with KeyStone in 2017. On December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, the Company reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000. (See Note 17). Brekford continues to retain a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety.\nOther than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe principally derive revenues from fees for services generated on a time and materials (T&M) basis. Revenues for T&M contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by the employees or consultants at an agreed-upon rate per hour set forth in standard rate sheets or as written from time to time in contracts or purchase orders. Revenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are primarily recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature. Revenue from the sale of individual franchises is recognized when the contract is signed and collectability is assured, unless the franchisee is required to perform certain training before operations commence.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our fee generating projects. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs, other marketing expenses, management and administrative personnel costs, payroll taxes, bonuses and employee benefits for these employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of revenues for those employees who provide our services. Operating expenses also include facility costs, depreciation and amortization, professional services, legal and accounting fees, and administrative operating costs. We expense operating costs when incurred.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nConsolidated operating results for year ended December 31, 2017 include Firestorm operations for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Brekford operations for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and Global operations for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNovume Solutions, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> $22,135,818\n</td> <td> $12,128,406\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> 13,792,473\n</td> <td> 6,959,514\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> 8,343,345\n</td> <td> 5,168,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> 12,981,744\n</td> <td> 5,262,768\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> (4,638,399)\n</td> <td> (93,876)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> (213,492)\n</td> <td> (165,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td> (483,909)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> (697,401)\n</td> <td> (165,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before taxes\n</td> <td> (5,335,800)\n</td> <td> (258,955)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> 294,666\n</td> <td> 219,971\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $(5,041,134)\n</td> <td> $(38,984)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31,\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $10,007,412, or 82.5%, to $22,135,818 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12,128,406 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue attributable to Firestorm was $2,150,273 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Brekford was $914,345 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Revenue attributable to Global was $5,645,747 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $1,297,047 increase in revenue attributable to legacy Novume was due to an increase in the number, duration and dollar volume of contracts in AOC Key Solutions.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6,832,959, or 98.2%, to $13,792,473 compared to $6,959,514 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenue attributable to Firestorm was $704,668 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Brekford was $445,082 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Cost of revenue attributable to Global was $4,983,044 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $700,165 increase in the cost of revenue of the legacy Novume was mostly attributable to increased revenue for AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $3,174,453, or 61.4%, to $8,343,345 compared to $5,168,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit attributable to Firestorm was $1,445,605 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Brekford was $469,263 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Gross profit attributable to Global was $662,703 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The $596,882 increase in the gross profit of the legacy Novume was consistent with the increased revenue and costs of revenues at AOC Key Solutions noted above.\nThe gross profit margin was 37.7% for the fiscal year ended December 31 2017, compared to 42.6% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the gross profit margin for Firestorm, Brekford and Global, the gross profit margin for legacy Novume for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was relatively consistent at 42.7% and 42.6%, respectively. Due to the nature of staffing companies, such as Global, having greater costs of services as compared to professional services support providers such as AOC Key Solutions, the addition of Global has a natural impact of lowering the consolidated gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $7,718,976, or 146.7%, to $12,981,744 compared to $5,262,768 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Firestorm was $1,733,380 for the period from January 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Brekford was $890,627 for the period from August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Global was $726,006 for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The Company also launched a new television show in the second quarter which increased operating costs and expenses by approximately $689,226 through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. This television show airs locally in the Washington DC market. The increase of $4,551,496 in selling, general and administrative expenses of legacy Novume was primarily due to an increase in holding company salaries, professional and legal services, expenses related to acquisitions and ramp up of operations and expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements that were lower during the year ended December 31, 2016 because the Company was formed in mid-March 2016 and spending increased during the year ended December 31, 2017. As percentage of revenue, our selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 58.6% compared to 43.4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nNovume anticipates that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase, however at a reduced pace, in future periods. These increases may include costs related to hiring of personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants as well as expenses related to maintaining compliance with applicable listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance, and investor relations activities.\nOther Expense\nOther expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $697,401 compared to other expense of $165,079 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily related to a $450,000 write-down related to the fiscal year 2018 sale of the note receivable from Global Public Safety, interest expense and change in derivative liability of $60,000, offset by rental income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We are required to pay income taxes in certain state jurisdictions. Historically, AOC Key Solutions and GCP initially elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, neither AOC Key Solutions nor GCP paid federal corporate income tax, and in most instances state income tax, on its taxable income. AOC Key Solutions revoked its S Corporation election upon the March 15, 2016 merger with KeyStone and GCP revoked its S Corporation election upon the October 1, 2017 acquisition by Novume, and are therefore, subject to corporate income taxes. Firestorm is a single-member LLC with KeyStone as the sole member.\nThe income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $294,666 and is due primarily to the deferred tax benefit recognized related to the NOL generated in the current period as compared to an income tax benefit of $219,971 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards to utilize in the U.S. of approximately $5.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that more likely than not will not be realized. These NOLs are scheduled to begin to expire in 2036 and are grandfathered under the new tax law; thus, these NOLs are not subject to the annual 80 percent limitation. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, was $5,041,134 compared to a net loss of $38,984 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss per common share was $(0.46) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss margin of $(0.01) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In order to accommodate organic growth, Firestorm added both line and senior staff in 2017. In addition, the planned asset purchases of BC Management and SEC LLC added expense and took place later than anticipated, thus delaying their integration and ability to increase revenue. As such, Firestorm's expense increases exceeded its revenue increases. Brekford incurred additional marketing and R&D expenses which resulted in a net loss. Global incurred expenses related to its integration with Novume which contributed to its net loss.\nCash Flow\nNovume expects to finance its operations over the next twelve months from the date of this Form 10-K primarily through existing cash flow, supplemented as necessary by funds available through access to credit and through access to additional capital.\nThe net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> $(3,167,146)\n</td> <td> $(136,079)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> (289,657)\n</td> <td> (36,833)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> 2,625,428\n</td> <td> 2,393,633\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td> $(831,375)\n</td> <td> $2,220,721\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $3,167,146.

As of December 31, 2017, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1,957,212 and working capital of $2,750,577, as compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2,788,587 and working capital of $3,714,958 as of December 31, 2016.\nIn the Fall of 2016, the Company commenced its Regulation A Offering (the \"Reg A Offering\") of up to 3,000,000 Units.

Novume Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.175 (7% per annum) per share, being an identical per annum percentage per share dividend as received by holders of KeyStone Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Brekford Merger. We anticipate that Novume will pay the quarterly cash dividends through cash flow from Novume, potential business growth from other acquired entities and access to additional credit or capital. The quarterly dividend payments are due within five (5) business days following the end of a quarter. On April 7, 2017, Novume paid cash dividends of $76,695 to holders of record of Novume Series A Preferred Stock as of March 30, 2017.

Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on the share price of Novume. On December 31, 2017, the Company declared and accrued dividends of $27,001 payable to shareholders of record as of December 31,\nOperating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued payroll and related benefits. The volume of billings and timing of collections and payments affect these account balances.\nAOC Key Solutions was a party to a business loan agreement (the 2015 Loan Agreement\u201d) with Sandy Spring Bank ( SSB\u201d) dated as of September 25, 2015. The primary credit facility was an asset based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 which was due to mature on September 30, 2016. To secure its obligations under the 2015 Loan Agreement, AOC Key Solutions had granted to SSB a security interest in its accounts receivable. SSB was required to advance funds to AOC Key Solutions up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all of its accounts receivable aged 90 days or less which contained selling terms and conditions acceptable to SSB. AOC Key Solutions did not draw any funds from this credit facility in 2015. Pursuant to First Amendment to Business Loan Agreement (Asset Based), dated May 9, 2016, SSB had waived the restrictions in the 2015 Loan Agreement on AOC Key Solutions' ability to make dividends to the Company. There was no outstanding balance on the 2015 Loan Agreement at December 31, 2016.\nOn August 11, 2016, Novume entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the 2016 Line of Credit\u201d) with SSB that replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement. The 2016 Line of Credit was comprised of: 1) an asset-based revolving line of credit up to $1,000,000 for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes which matured on July 31, 2017, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.50% and was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets; and 2) an optional term loan of $100,000, which was for permanent working capital, bore interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, floating, plus 0.75%, required monthly payments of principal plus interest to fully amortize the loan over four years, was secured by a first lien on all of Novume's business assets, cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the revolving line of credit, and was to mature on February 15, 2019.\nThe borrowing base for the 2016 Line of Credit was up to the lesser of (1) $1,000,000 or (2) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount of all eligible accounts receivable as defined by SSB. The borrowing base for the $100,000 term loan was fully reserved under the borrowing base for the revolving line of credit. The 2016 Line of Credit had periodic reporting requirements and balance sheet covenants, as well as affirmative and negative operational and ownership covenants. Novume was in compliance with all 2016 Line of Credit covenants at December 31, 2016. In August 2017, the Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit with SSB. As such, there was no outstanding balance on the 2016 Line of Credit at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Novume had no balances due for the 2016 Line of Credit or the 2015 Loan Agreement and there were no amounts outstanding as of the date of this Form 10-K. When Novume replaced the 2015 Loan Agreement with the 2016 Line of Credit on August 11, 2016, neither line of credit had a balance due. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nGlobal has revolving lines of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( WFB\u201d) ( the Global Wells Agreements\u201d). WFB agreed to advance to Global, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $5,000,000. Interest is payable under the Global Wells Agreements at a monthly rate equal to the Three-Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 3% plus the Margin. The Margin is 3%. Payment of the revolving lines of credit is secured by the accounts receivable of Global. The current terms of the Global Wells Agreements run through December 31, 2018, with automatic renewal terms of 12 months. WFB or Global may terminate the Global Wells Agreements upon at least 60 days' written notice prior to the last day of the current term. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $2,057,259. As part of the lines of credit agreements, Global must maintain certain financial covenants. Global met all financial covenant requirements during and as of the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn November 12, 2017, AOC Key Solutions entered into an Account Purchase Agreement and related agreements (the KSI Wells Agreement\u201d) with WFB. Pursuant to the KSI Wells Agreement, AOC Key Solutions agreed to sell and assign to WFB all of its Accounts (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code), constituting accounts arising out of sales of Goods (as such term is defined in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) or rendition of services that WFB deems to be eligible for borrowing under the KSI Wells Agreement. WFB agreed to advance to AOC Key Solutions, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $3,000,000. Interest is payable under the KSI Wells Agreement at a monthly rate equal to the Daily One Month LIBOR in effect from time to time plus 5%. The KSI Wells Agreement also provides for a deficit interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate plus 50% and a default interest rate equal to the then applicable interest rate or deficit interest rate, plus 50%. The initial term of the KSI Wells Agreement runs through December 31, 2018 (the Initial Term\u201d), with automatic renewal terms of 12 months (the Renewal Term\u201d), commencing on the first day after the last day of the Initial Term. AOC Key Solutions may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement upon at least 60 days' prior written notice, but no more than 120 days' written notice, prior to and effective as of the last day of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, as the case may be. WFB may terminate the KSI Wells Agreement at any time and for any reason upon 30 days' written notice or without notice upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Agreement) after the expiration of any grace or cure period. The principal balance at December 31, 2017 totaled $1,606,327.\nOn March 16, 2016, Novume entered into a Subordinated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Novume agreed to issue up to $1,000,000 in subordinated debt (the \"Avon Road Note\") and warrants to purchase up to 242,493 shares of Novume's common stock ( Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants\u201d). The exercise price for the Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants is equal to $1.031 per share of common stock. Subordinated notes with a face amount of $500,000 and Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase 121,247 shares of Novume's common stock have been issued pursuant to the Avon Road Note Purchase Agreement to Avon Road Partners, L.P. ( Avon Road\u201d), an affiliate of Robert Berman, Novume's CEO and a member of Novume's Board of Directors. The Avon Road Subordinated Note Warrants had an expiration date of March 16, 2019 and qualified for equity accounting as the warrants did not fall within the scope of ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The fair value was determined to be $58,520 and was recorded as a debt discount and additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, through the maturity date of the note payable.\nThe Avon Road Note is subordinated to the Novume's 2016 Line of Credit with SSB and any successor financing facility. Simple interest accrues on the unpaid principal of the note at a rate equal to the lower of (a) 9% per annum, or (b) the highest rate permitted by applicable law. Interest is payable monthly, and the note matures on March 16, 2019. The Company terminated the 2016 Line of Credit in August 2017.\nThe Company has generated losses since its inception in August 2017 and has relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit and the sale of a note to support cashflow from operations. The Company attributes the 2017 losses to public company corporate overhead and losses generated by some of our subsidiary operations. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of approximately $5.04 million and positive working capital of approximately $2.75 million. The Company's cash position was increased in April 2018 by the receipt of $2 million related to the issuance of a promissory note. Management believes that based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable that its forecasts, for one year from the date of the filing of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, indicate improved operations and the Company's ability to continue operations as a going concern. The Company has contingency plans to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays should operations not improve in the look-forward period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Novume did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\nRecent Events\nOn April 3, 2018, Novume and Brekford entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor (the \"Lender\") loaned to $2,000,000 to Novume and Brekford. The loan is due and payable on May 1, 2019 and bears interest at 15% per annum, with a minimum of 15% interest payable regardless of when the loan is repaid. The loan is secured by a security interest in all of the assets of Brekford. In addition, Novume agreed to issue 35,000 shares of common stock to the Lender, which shares contain piggy-back registration rights. If the shares are not so registered on the next selling shareholder registration statement, Novume is obligated to issue an additional 15,000 shares to the Lender. Upon any sale of Brekford or its assets, the Lender will be entitled to receive 7% of any proceeds received by Novume or Brekford in excess of $5 million. In addition, commencing January 1, 2020, the Lender shall be paid 7% of Brekford's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less any capital expenditures, of which this amount would be credited against proceeds from the sale of Brekford, if any.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon Novume's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the management of Novume to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Novume bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management of Novume believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form management's basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nNovume's accounting policies are further described in its historical audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Novume has identified the following critical accounting policies:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize its revenues for the provision of services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Novume principally derives revenues from fees for services generated on a project by project basis. Revenues for time-and-materials contracts are recognized based on the number of hours worked by our employees or consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour set forth in our standard rate sheet or as written from time to time in our contracts or purchase orders. These costs are recognized in the period in which services are performed.\nRevenues related to firm-fixed-price contracts are recognized upon completion of the project as these projects are typically short-term in nature.\nThe agreements entered into in connection with a project, whether on a time-and-materials basis or firm-fixed-price basis, typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with 30-days' notice. In the event of termination, the client is contractually required to pay for all time, materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination.\nFor automated traffic safety enforcement revenue, we recognize the revenue when the required collection efforts, from citizens, are completed and posted to the municipality's account. The respective municipality is then billed depending on the terms of the respective contract, typically 15 days after the preceding month while collections are reconciled. For contracts where we receive a percentage of collected fines, revenue is calculated based upon the posted payments from citizens multiplied by our contractual percentage. For contracts where we receive a specific fixed monthly fee regardless of citations issued or collected, revenue is recorded once the amount collected from citizens exceeds the monthly fee per camera. Our fixed fee contracts typically have a revenue neutral provision whereby the municipality's payment to us cannot exceed amounts collected from citizens within a given month.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of its clients' financial condition, and Novume generally does not require collateral.\nManagement reviews accounts receivable to determine if any receivables will potentially be"}
