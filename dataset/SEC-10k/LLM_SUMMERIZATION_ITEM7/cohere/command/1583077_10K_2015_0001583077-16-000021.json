Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on July 25, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (\"REIT\") beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We were formed primarily to acquire lodging properties in the midscale limited service, extended stay, select service, upscale select service, and upper upscale full service segments within the hospitality sector. As of December 31, 2015, we had acquired or had an interest in a total of 136 hotels with a total of 16,644 guestrooms located in 32 states. As of December 31, 2015, all but one of our hotels operated under a franchise or license agreement with a national brand owned by one of Hilton Worldwide, Inc., Marriott International, Inc., Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and Intercontinental Hotels Group or one of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. During February 2016, we completed an acquisition comprising investments in six additional hotels with a total of 707 guestrooms located in two states, all of which were operated under a franchise or license agreement with one of our national brands.\nOn January 7, 2014, we commenced our primary initial public offering (\"IPO\" or the \"Offering\") on a \"reasonable best efforts\" basis of up to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-190698), as well as up to 21,052,631 shares of common stock available pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP\") under which our common stockholders could elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO, and, on November 18, 2015, Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the \"Former Dealer Manager\"), the dealer manager of our IPO, suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash. Concurrently with this change to our distribution policy, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding and had received total gross proceeds of approximately $902.9 million, including shares issued under the DRIP.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through American Realty Capital Hospitality Operating Partnership, L.P. (the \"OP\"), a Delaware limited partnership. We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interest in the OP entitled OP Units\u201d (\"OP Units\"). Additionally, our Advisor contributed $2,020 to the OP in exchange for 90 OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. The holders of OP Units have the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of common stock of us in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP. The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets.\nOur Former Dealer Manager served as the dealer manager of our IPO and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide us with various services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer\nManager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Capital, the parent of our Sponsor, and AR Global.\nWe have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage certain aspects of our affairs on a day-to-day basis. American Realty Capital Hospitality Properties, LLC or one of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Property Manager\"), serves as our property manager and the Property Manager has retained Crestline Hotels & Resorts, LLC (\"Crestline\") to provide services, including locating investments, negotiating financing and operating certain hotel assets in our portfolio.\nThe Advisor, the Property Manager and Crestline are under common control with AR Global and AR Capital, as a result of which they are related parties, and each of which has received or will receive compensation, fees and other expense reimbursements from us for services related to our IPO and the investment and management of our assets.\nWe, directly or indirectly through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, enter into agreements with the Property Manager, which, in turn, engages Crestline or a third-party sub-property manager to manage our hotel properties. Crestline is a leading hospitality management company in the United States, and as of December 31, 2015, had 100 hotels and 15,104 rooms under management in 27 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2015, 66 of our hotels and 8,937 rooms were managed by Crestline, and 70 of our hotels and 7,707 rooms were managed by third-party sub-property managers.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation/Combination and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements include our accounts and our subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as percentage ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nThe Predecessor represents hospitality assets and operations owned by Barcel\u00f3 Crestline Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"BCC\"), which historically have been maintained in various legal entities. Historically, financial statements have not been prepared for the Predecessor as a discrete stand-alone entity. The accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements for the Predecessor as of December 31, 2014, for the period from January 1 to March 20, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been derived from the historical accounting records of BCC and reflect the assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses directly attributable to the Predecessor, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Predecessor on a stand-alone basis.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, the useful lives of real estate and real estate taxes, as applicable.\nReal Estate Investments\nWe allocate the purchase price of properties acquired in real estate investments to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are based on purchase price allocation studies performed by independent third parties or our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, as applicable, are typically related to contracts, including operating lease agreements, ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements, which will be recorded at fair value. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nInvestments in real estate that are not considered to be business combinations under GAAP are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of our assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold interests.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nBelow-Market Lease\nThe below-market lease intangible is based on the difference between the market rent and the contractual rent and is discounted to a present value using an interest rate reflecting our current assessment of the risk associated with the leases assumed at acquisition. Acquired lease intangible assets are amortized over the remaining lease term. The amortization of a below-market lease is recorded as an increase to rent expense on the consolidated/combined statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. The estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. No such impairment losses were recorded in the periods presented.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of amounts required under mortgage agreements for future capital improvements to owned assets, future interest and property tax payments and cash flow deposits while subject to mortgage agreement restrictions. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, changes in restricted cash caused by changes to the amount needed for future capital improvements are treated as investing activities, changes related to future debt service payments are treated as financing activities, and changes related to real estate tax payments and excess cash flow deposits are treated as operating activities.\nDeferred Financing Fees\nDeferred financing fees represent commitment fees, legal fees and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These fees are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing fees are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not be successful.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810, Consolidation contains the guidance surrounding the definition of variable interest entities (\"VIE\"), the definition of variable interests and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We have variable interests in VIEs through our investments in entities which own the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center (the \"Westin Virginia Beach\") and the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg.\nOnce it is determined that we hold a variable interest in an entity, GAAP requires that we perform a qualitative analysis to determine (i) which entity has the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The entity that has both of these characteristics is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nWe hold an interest in BSE/AH Blacksburg Hotel, LLC (the \"HGI Blacksburg JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg, and an interest in TCA Block 7 Hotel, LLC (the \"Westin Virginia Beach JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Westin Virginia Beach.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2015, upon the acquisition of an additional equity interest in the HGI Blacksburg JV, we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary, with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, and therefore consolidated the entity in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition (See Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have concluded we are not the primary beneficiary with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the Westin Virginia Beach JV, and have therefore not consolidated the entity. We have accounted for the entity under the equity method of accounting and included it in investments in unconsolidated entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nHotel revenue is recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel services.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our tax year ended December 31, 2014. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, and must comply with various other organizational and operational requirements. We generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property tax and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Our hotels are leased to taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\") which are owned by the OP. The TRSs are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is \"more-likely-than-not\" that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.\nEarnings/Loss per Share\nWe calculate basic income or loss per share by dividing net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average shares of its common stock outstanding for a respective period. Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested stock awards, except when doing so would be anti-dilutive.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in an orderly transaction on the measurement date. The market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is known as the principal market. When no principal market exists, the most advantageous market is used. This is the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the price that maximizes the amount that would be received or minimizes the amount that would be paid. Fair value is based on assumptions market participants would make in pricing the asset or liability. Generally, fair value is based on observable quoted market prices or derived from observable market data when such market prices or data are available. When such prices or inputs are not available, the reporting entity should use valuation models.\nOur financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized based on the priority of the inputs used to measure fair value. The inputs used in measuring fair value are categorized into three levels, as follows:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or models based on valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs for hotel operations as incurred. These costs were $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $0.4 million combined for our company and the Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nReceivables consist principally of trade receivables from customers and are generally unsecured and are due within 30 to 90 days. We record a provision for uncollectible accounts using the allowance method. Expected credit losses associated with trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical patterns of credit losses for aged receivables as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable, potentially uncollectible balances. When internal collection efforts on accounts have been exhausted, the accounts are written off and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts is reduced.\nDerivative Transactions\nWe at certain times enter into derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Our derivatives as of December 31, 2015, consisted of interest rate cap agreements, which we believe will help to mitigate our exposure to increasing borrowing costs under floating rate indebtedness. We have elected not to designate our interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The impact of the interest rate caps for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the consolidated financial statements was immaterial.\nReportable Segments\nWe have determined that we have one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate. Our investments in real estate generate room revenue and other income through the operation of the properties, which comprise 100% of the total consolidated/combined revenues. Management evaluates the operating performance of our investments in real estate on an individual property level, none of which represent a reportable segment.\nRevenue Performance Metrics\nWe measure hotel revenue performance by evaluating revenue metrics such as:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Occupancy percentage ( Occ\u201d) - Occ represents the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occ measures the utilization of our hotels' available capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Average Daily Rate ( ADR\u201d) - ADR represents total hotel revenues divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue per Available room ( RevPAR\u201d) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occ.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Occ, ADR, and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operating performance. ADR and RevPAR do not include food and beverage or other revenues generated by the hotels. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget, to prior periods and to the competitive set in the market, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis.\nOur Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nResults of Operations\nIn March of 2014 we closed on the acquisition of interests in six hotels through fee simple, leasehold and joint venture interests (the \"Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $110.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In February 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 116 hotels through fee simple and leasehold interests (the \"Grace Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion, exclusive of closing costs. In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 10 hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $150.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In November and December 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in four hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Noble and Second Noble Portfolios\") for an aggregate purchase price of $107.6 million, exclusive of closing costs. During December 2015 and January 2016, we terminated our obligation to acquire 24 additional hotels, and as a result forfeited an aggregate of $41.1 million in non-refundable deposits. In February 2016, we completed the acquisition of six hotels through fee simple interests (the \"Third Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, exclusive of closing costs. Also in February 2016, we reinstated our obligation under a previously terminated agreement with Summit, which we refer to as our Pending Acquisition, to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, we will require additional debt or equity financing to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition. Any failure to complete our Pending Acquisition could cause us to default under the reinstated purchase agreement and forfeit the $7.5 million deposit. We also do not expect to make future acquisitions unless we can obtain equity or debt financing in addition to the additional capital we need to meet our existing capital requirements.\nThe closing of our Pending Acquisition is scheduled for December 30, 2016, but Summit has the right to market and ultimately sell any or all of the hotels to be purchased to a bona fide third party purchaser without our consent at any time prior to the completion of our Pending Acquisition. Whether or not Summit engages, or is successful, in any efforts to market these hotels is beyond our control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance we will be able to complete our Pending Acquisition in whole or in part.\nSee Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of these transactions.\nFollowing amendments to our agreement with the Advisor and the limited partnership agreement of the OP on November 11, 2015, we became required to pay asset management fees, which may be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election, on a monthly basis effective October 1, 2015, equal to the cost of our assets (until we establish Estimated Per-Share NAV, then the lower of the cost of our assets and the fair value of our assets), multiplied by 0.0625%. We ceased causing units of limited partnership in our OP entitled \"Class B Units\" (\"Class B Units\") to be issued to the Advisor with respect to periods commencing on or after September 30, 2015. Historically, the issuance of Class B Units was not reflected as an expense in our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations, except for the distributions made on the associated Class B Units. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations include an expense for the asset management fee payable in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof.\nIn March of 2016, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nThe following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the comparable periods in 2014 as well as results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable periods in 2013. Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 include results from the Predecessor from January 1, 2014 to March 20, 2014.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRoom revenues for the portfolio were $420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to room revenues of $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, including results from the Predecessor period. The increase in room revenues was primarily due to acquisitions. Room revenues make up a significant majority of our total revenues, which are highly dependent on maintaining and improving Occ and ADR, which drive RevPAR.\nThe following table presents operating information of the hotels in our portfolio for the periods in which we have owned them.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur results of operations only include the results of operations of the hotels we have acquired beginning on the date of each hotel's acquisition. The following table presents pro-forma operating information of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full periods presented.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proforma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe pro-forma RevPAR growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9%, driven by growth in occupancy and ADR. Other non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage, and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees. Other non-room operating revenues, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 5.5%, over the prior year period.\nOur hotel operating expenses consist primarily of labor expenses incurred in the day-to-day operation of our hotels. Our hotels have a variety of fixed expenses, such as essential hotel staff, real estate taxes and insurance, and these expenses do not change materially even if the revenues at the hotels fluctuate. Our primary hotel operating expenses are described below:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rooms expense: These costs include labor (housekeeping and rooms operation), reservation systems, room supplies, linen and laundry services.

In addition, these expenses include real and personal property taxes and insurance, which are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue or performance at the hotels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal hotel operating expenses, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 12.2%, over the prior year period. Hotel operating expenses include certain operating costs that increase relative to increases in revenue, such as management fees and franchise fees that have a higher rate as a percentage of revenue for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, contributing to the overall increase in expenses. Additionally, 2015 was negatively impacted by disruption from and transition costs associated with the consolidation of management companies throughout 2015 as we strategically aligned markets and management companies.\nDepreciation and amortization increased approximately $64.8 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to acquisitions.\nInterest expense increased approximately $74.2 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to additional mortgage debt and the issuance of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities related to the acquisition of the Grace Portfolio.\nAcquisition and transaction related costs increased approximately $53.6 million due to costs associated with acquisitions, and forfeited deposits related to terminated acquisitions of approximately $19.1 million.\nGeneral and administrative increased approximately $9.3 million, primarily attributable to our growth and certain expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nOther income (expense) changed by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due to the loss recorded related to the change in the fair value associated with the contingent consideration payable due in connection with the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRoom revenues were $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to room revenues of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. RevPAR for the total portfolio increased 6.2% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2014. The RevPAR growth rates reflect the percentage change from the prior year's results.\nOcc, ADR and RevPAR results are presented in the following tables to reflect certain operating information for the portfolio.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe RevPAR rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is the result of the growth in ADR and occupancy, particularly at the Baltimore Courtyard due to renovations to the lobby and improvements to the restaurant and bar and higher RevPAR growth in the greater Baltimore market. These renovations also resulted in a lower occupancy at the hotel in 2013. Also contributing to the higher RevPAR was an increase in both transient and group occupied rooms at the Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy overall in the Atlanta market and the efforts of Crestline to improve the operations of the hotel which included appointing a new hotel general manager. Occupancy also increased at the Westin Virginia Beach primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy in the Virginia Beach market. These increases were offset by a decrease in RevPAR at Stratford Homewood Suites which had a higher occupancy than normal in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of people displaced from their homes by Hurricane Sandy.\nOther non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage (16.6% and 15.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees (8.7% and 7.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively). The increase compared to 2013 is primarily driven by higher occupancy and group related revenue, such as group meetings and conferences, at the Georgia Tech Hotel. Hotel operating expenses increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 mainly due to increased room and other property-level expenses at the Baltimore Courtyard and Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted primarily by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by acquisition and transaction related costs, increases in restricted cash, and increases in prepaids and other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $772.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to acquisitions and capital investments in our properties.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities was $680.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily impacted by proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from mortgage notes payable, partially offset by redemptions of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and repayments of promissory and mortgage notes payable.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.7 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by a net loss of $14.8 million, which was, in turn, largely the result of the amount of transaction fees related to the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio and the Grace Portfolio and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.9 million as a result of prepaid acquisition expenses for the Grace Portfolio and the receivable from the Former Dealer Manager for the shares sold on the last day of the year of $1.6 million. These were offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.8 million, an increase in due to affiliates of $5.0 million, mainly related to services provided to us related to the Grace Portfolio and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.0 million related to the deferred payment and contingent consideration from the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $122.1 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio for $41.4 million, the deposit on the Grace Portfolio of $75.0 million, an increase in restricted cash of $2.0 million related to requirements of the new mortgage note payable and $3.7 million of improvements at the properties, primarily due to renovations at the Stratford Homewood Suites.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $263.6 million. Cash inflows were primarily driven by proceeds from the mortgage note payable of $45.5 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $249.6 million. These were offset by the payment of offering costs of $28.1 million and the payment of deferred financing fees of $2.6 million. During the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015, we received proceeds of $40.5 million from an affiliate note payable to fund the deposit on the Grace Acquisition which was then repaid in full.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $46.8 million. Under certain of our debt obligations, we are required to maintain minimum liquidity of $20 million to comply with financial covenants and we expect to satisfy this covenant through liquidity we maintain at individual hotels as well as through other sources.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO and, on November 18, 2015, the Former Dealer Manager suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire an aggregate of 44 hotels from three different independent parties (the SN Acquisitions\u201d), including Summit, for an aggregate purchase price of $740.3 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired 14 of the 44 hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $257.7 million, which was funded with $15.6 million previously paid as a deposit, $76.9 million from the proceeds of our IPO, and $165.2 million from an advance under the SN Term Loan. Following the suspension of our IPO, our failure to obtain financing alternatives to our IPO caused us to forfeit $19.1 million in earnest money deposits with respect to 15 hotels during December 2015 and $22.0 million in earnest money deposits with respect to nine hotels during January 2016 because we did not have sufficient capital available to complete the SN Acquisitions scheduled to close during those periods. During February 2016, we acquired six hotels from Summit for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, which (together with certain closing costs) was funded with (i) $70.4 million from an advance, secured by a mortgage on the hotels acquired, under the SN Term Loan, (ii) $20.0 million in proceeds from a loan from Summit (the Summit Loan\u201d), and (iii) $18.5 million previously paid as an earnest money deposit. Also on February 11, 2016, we agreed to reinstate our obligation to complete our Pending Acquisition that had previously been terminated to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million from Summit, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million. The deposit was also financed with the proceeds from the Summit Loan.\nOur major capital requirements during 2016 include capital expenditures required pursuant to our franchise agreements and related escrows required under our indebtedness, interest and principal payments under our indebtedness, interest payments on\nthe Grace Preferred Equity Interests and asset management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Advisor. We are also required to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition (including amounts we intend to finance), which is scheduled to occur in December 2016. Failure to do so could cause us to forfeit up to $7.5 million in non-refundable earnest money deposits previously paid.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash.\nConcurrently with this change in our distribution policy, we amended (the Amendment\u201d) our agreement with our Advisor (as amended, the Advisory Agreement\u201d) to provide us with the right to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under the Advisory Agreement in shares of our common stock for the period of time beginning on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, commencing on the date (the Trigger\u201d) that the elimination of the Company's payment of cash distributions is insufficient to provide adequate liquidity levels consistent with assumptions mutually agreed to in good faith by our independent directors and our Advisor from time to time (the Relief Period\u201d), subject to termination on the earlier of: (a) the date on which we have completed a public or private offering, which provides net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such offering; (b) the date on which we have completed an asset sale or borrowing, which provides net proceeds in excess of $50.0 million, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction; (c) the date that our board of directors declares a distribution all or a portion of which is payable in cash; (d) a change of control (as defined in the Amendment), any restructuring of our debt or preferred stock that results in net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction or such transaction results in the reduction in other cash usage by us during the Relief Period in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, or a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of substantially all of our assets; (e) termination of the Advisory Agreement; or (f) the date on which the amendment to our charter, as described below, is not approved by our stockholders. If an event described in items (d) or (e) above occurs, we have agreed to redeem any shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above for cash at the original issuance price. Pursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed to certain registration rights for the benefit of the Advisor with respect to the resale of the shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above.\nPrior to the Amendment and for asset management services for periods after September 30, 2015, we paid asset management fees in cash or shares of common stock, or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election.\nPursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed, subject to approval of our stockholders of an amendment to our charter which we have agreed to present to our stockholders at our 2016 annual meeting, to extend the term of the Advisory Agreement to June 1, 2017 and that the notice period for terminating the Advisory Agreement will be ninety (90) days' notice instead of sixty (60) days' notice if the Trigger occurs prior to an expiration of the term.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nIf obtained, any additional debt or equity financing could be on terms that would not be favorable to us or our stockholders, including high interest rates, in the case of debt financing, and substantial dilution, in the case of equity issuances or convertible securities. Moreover, because we are required to use 35% of the proceeds from the issuance of interests in us or any of our subsidiaries, to redeem the Grace Preferred Equity Interests at par, up to a maximum of $350 million in redemptions for any 12-month period, it may be more difficult to obtain equity financing from an alternative source in an amount required to meet our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $294.5 million of liquidation value remained outstanding under the Grace Preferred Equity Interests.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $1.4 billion in indebtedness plus an additional $294.5 million in liquidation value of Grace Preferred Equity Interests (which are treated as indebtedness for accounting purposes), all of which was incurred in acquiring the real properties we currently own, substantially all of which have been pledged as security under our indebtedness. If our cash flow from operations and other available sources are insufficient to fund interest and principal under our indebtedness or make mandatory redemptions of the Grace Preferred Equity Interests we could lose control of our properties.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, our ability to achieve our original investment objective of a loan-to-value ratio of 50% has been adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, our loan-to-value ratio, including the Grace Preferred Equity Interests, was 75%, and our loan-to-value ratio excluding the Grace Preferred Equity Interests was 57%.\nUnder our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness may not exceed 300% of our total net assets\u201d (which is generally defined in our charter as our assets less our liabilities) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally equal to approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.\nPrior to our entry into agreements related to our acquisition and financing activities during 2014 and 2015, a majority of our independent directors waived the total portfolio leverage requirement of our charter with respect to acquisition and financing activities should such total portfolio leverage exceed 300% of our total \"net assets\" in connection with such acquisition and financing activities. Our total portfolio leverage (which includes the Grace Preferred Equity Interests) has significantly exceeded this 300% limit at times. As of December 31, 2015, our total portfolio leverage was 232%.\nWe are also subject to covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios and negative pledges, in our existing indebtedness that restrict our ability to make future borrowings.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted the SRP that enables stockholders, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to sell their shares to us. On January 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved an amendment and restatement to the SRP. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, below. Under the SRP, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares of common stock. Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors and generally will be made semiannually. We fund repurchases from proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the DRIP as well as any reservation of funds our board of directors, in its sole discretion, makes available for this purpose.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we did not accept all of the repurchase requests we received.\nThe following table reflects the cumulative number of shares repurchased as of and during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Shares Repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Price per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended December 31, 2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>As permitted under the SRP, the board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the three months ended December 31, 2015, the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount equal to 1.0% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, representing less than all the shares validly submitted for repurchase during the three months ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, repurchases of 28,264 shares for $0.6 million at an average repurchase price per share of $23.44 (including all shares submitted for death or disability) were completed in January 2016, while repurchase requests for 64,454 shares for $1.5 million at an average price per share of $23.48 were not fulfilled. The accrual for repurchase requests that were approved but not completed during the three months ended December 31, 2015 is reflected in the accounts payable and accrued expenses line of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were no other unfulfilled share repurchases for the period from July 25, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may not be fully informative.\nBecause of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations or property acquisitions, has resulted in acquisition fees and expenses being expensed under GAAP. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings and typically paying acquisition fees.\nBecause of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year over year, both before and after we have deployed all of our Offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisitions fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses, amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.\nWe believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders (although we are not currently paying cash distributions). FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guideline or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the a publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.\nThe table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net loss attributable to stockholders in our calculation of FFO and MFFO for the periods indicated. In calculating our FFO and MFFO, we exclude the impact of amounts attributable to our non-controlling interests and the portion of the adjustment allocable to non-controlling interests.

The distributions were payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. Because we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, in March 2016, our board of directors changed our distribution policy such that, beginning with distributions with respect to April 2016, we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash. Accordingly, we will pay a cash distribution to stockholders of record each day during March 2016 on April 5, 2016, but future distributions will be on a monthly basis to stockholders of record each day during the prior month, commencing with April 2016, in an amount equivalent to $1.70 per annum, divided by $23.75 until we establish Estimated Per-Share NAV and our Estimated Per-Share NAV thereafter. The distributions will be made by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.\nOur distribution policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors, and may be changed at any time. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay distributions in shares of common stock as set forth above or be able to\npay distributions in cash in the future. Our ability to make future cash distributions will depend on our future cash flows and may be dependent on our ability to obtain additional liquidity, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common stockholders for the years presented (in thousands)(1):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

To the extent we pay distributions in excess of cash flows provided by operations, our stockholders' investment in our common stock may be adversely impacted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid distributions of $37.3 million, of which $19.2 million, or 51.3%, was funded from proceeds from our IPO, and $18.1 million, or 48.7%, was funded from proceeds from our IPO which were reinvested in common stock issued under our DRIP.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nDebt Obligations:\nThe following is a summary of our mortgage notes payable obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments due on mortgage notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,357,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>955,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>401,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments due on mortgage notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,569,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,098,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a summary of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments due on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments due on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease Obligations:\nThe following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from us over the next five years and thereafter for our lease arrangements as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease payments due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty Improvement Plan Reserve Deposits:\nThe following table reflects estimated PIP reserve deposits that are required under our mortgage debt obligations over the next five years as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PIP reserve deposits due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nElection as a REIT\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our taxable income or capital gain which is distributed to our stockholders. Our hotels are leased to a TRS which is owned by the OP. A TRS is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation purposes as a REIT in any subsequent year after electing REIT status and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that\nyear will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and cash available for distribution. However, we believe that we will continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by increases in operating costs due to inflation that may not be offset by increased room rates.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, whereby we have paid or may in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common control with our Advisor in connection with acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs. AR Capital, the parent of our Sponsor and the predecessor to AR Global, is a party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager, pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided us and certain other companies sponsored by AR Capital and AR Global with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services, among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. AR Capital instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided by RCS Advisory. We are also party to a transfer agency agreement with American National Stock Transfer, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ( ANST\u201d), pursuant to which ANST provided us with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by a third-party transfer agent. AR Global received written notice from ANST on February 10, 2016 that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. On February 26, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with DST Systems, Inc., our previous provider of sub-transfer agency services, to provide us directly with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services).

As of December 31, 2015, all but one of our hotels operated under a franchise or license agreement with a national brand owned by one of Hilton Worldwide, Inc., Marriott International, Inc., Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and Intercontinental Hotels Group or one of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. During February 2016, we completed an acquisition comprising investments in six additional hotels with a total of 707 guestrooms located in two states, all of which were operated under a franchise or license agreement with one of our national brands.\nOn January 7, 2014, we commenced our primary initial public offering (\"IPO\" or the \"Offering\") on a \"reasonable best efforts\" basis of up to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-190698), as well as up to 21,052,631 shares of common stock available pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP\") under which our common stockholders could elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO, and, on November 18, 2015, Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the \"Former Dealer Manager\"), the dealer manager of our IPO, suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash. Concurrently with this change to our distribution policy, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding and had received total gross proceeds of approximately $902.9 million, including shares issued under the DRIP.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through American Realty Capital Hospitality Operating Partnership, L.P. (the \"OP\"), a Delaware limited partnership. We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interest in the OP entitled OP Units\u201d (\"OP Units\"). Additionally, our Advisor contributed $2,020 to the OP in exchange for 90 OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. The holders of OP Units have the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of common stock of us in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP. The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets.\nOur Former Dealer Manager served as the dealer manager of our IPO and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide us with various services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer\nManager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Capital, the parent of our Sponsor, and AR Global.\nWe have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage certain aspects of our affairs on a day-to-day basis. American Realty Capital Hospitality Properties, LLC or one of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Property Manager\"), serves as our property manager and the Property Manager has retained Crestline Hotels & Resorts, LLC (\"Crestline\") to provide services, including locating investments, negotiating financing and operating certain hotel assets in our portfolio.\nThe Advisor, the Property Manager and Crestline are under common control with AR Global and AR Capital, as a result of which they are related parties, and each of which has received or will receive compensation, fees and other expense reimbursements from us for services related to our IPO and the investment and management of our assets.\nWe, directly or indirectly through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, enter into agreements with the Property Manager, which, in turn, engages Crestline or a third-party sub-property manager to manage our hotel properties. Crestline is a leading hospitality management company in the United States, and as of December 31, 2015, had 100 hotels and 15,104 rooms under management in 27 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2015, 66 of our hotels and 8,937 rooms were managed by Crestline, and 70 of our hotels and 7,707 rooms were managed by third-party sub-property managers.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation/Combination and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements include our accounts and our subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as percentage ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nThe Predecessor represents hospitality assets and operations owned by Barcel\u00f3 Crestline Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"BCC\"), which historically have been maintained in various legal entities. Historically, financial statements have not been prepared for the Predecessor as a discrete stand-alone entity. The accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements for the Predecessor as of December 31, 2014, for the period from January 1 to March 20, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been derived from the historical accounting records of BCC and reflect the assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses directly attributable to the Predecessor, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Predecessor on a stand-alone basis.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, the useful lives of real estate and real estate taxes, as applicable.\nReal Estate Investments\nWe allocate the purchase price of properties acquired in real estate investments to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are based on purchase price allocation studies performed by independent third parties or our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, as applicable, are typically related to contracts, including operating lease agreements, ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements, which will be recorded at fair value. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nInvestments in real estate that are not considered to be business combinations under GAAP are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of our assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold interests.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nBelow-Market Lease\nThe below-market lease intangible is based on the difference between the market rent and the contractual rent and is discounted to a present value using an interest rate reflecting our current assessment of the risk associated with the leases assumed at acquisition. Acquired lease intangible assets are amortized over the remaining lease term. The amortization of a below-market lease is recorded as an increase to rent expense on the consolidated/combined statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. The estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. No such impairment losses were recorded in the periods presented.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of amounts required under mortgage agreements for future capital improvements to owned assets, future interest and property tax payments and cash flow deposits while subject to mortgage agreement restrictions. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, changes in restricted cash caused by changes to the amount needed for future capital improvements are treated as investing activities, changes related to future debt service payments are treated as financing activities, and changes related to real estate tax payments and excess cash flow deposits are treated as operating activities.\nDeferred Financing Fees\nDeferred financing fees represent commitment fees, legal fees and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These fees are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing fees are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not be successful.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810, Consolidation contains the guidance surrounding the definition of variable interest entities (\"VIE\"), the definition of variable interests and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We have variable interests in VIEs through our investments in entities which own the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center (the \"Westin Virginia Beach\") and the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg.\nOnce it is determined that we hold a variable interest in an entity, GAAP requires that we perform a qualitative analysis to determine (i) which entity has the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The entity that has both of these characteristics is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nWe hold an interest in BSE/AH Blacksburg Hotel, LLC (the \"HGI Blacksburg JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg, and an interest in TCA Block 7 Hotel, LLC (the \"Westin Virginia Beach JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Westin Virginia Beach.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2015, upon the acquisition of an additional equity interest in the HGI Blacksburg JV, we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary, with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, and therefore consolidated the entity in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition (See Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have concluded we are not the primary beneficiary with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the Westin Virginia Beach JV, and have therefore not consolidated the entity. We have accounted for the entity under the equity method of accounting and included it in investments in unconsolidated entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nHotel revenue is recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel services.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our tax year ended December 31, 2014. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, and must comply with various other organizational and operational requirements. We generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property tax and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Our hotels are leased to taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\") which are owned by the OP. The TRSs are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is \"more-likely-than-not\" that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.\nEarnings/Loss per Share\nWe calculate basic income or loss per share by dividing net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average shares of its common stock outstanding for a respective period. Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested stock awards, except when doing so would be anti-dilutive.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in an orderly transaction on the measurement date. The market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is known as the principal market. When no principal market exists, the most advantageous market is used. This is the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the price that maximizes the amount that would be received or minimizes the amount that would be paid. Fair value is based on assumptions market participants would make in pricing the asset or liability. Generally, fair value is based on observable quoted market prices or derived from observable market data when such market prices or data are available. When such prices or inputs are not available, the reporting entity should use valuation models.\nOur financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized based on the priority of the inputs used to measure fair value. The inputs used in measuring fair value are categorized into three levels, as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or models based on valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the investment. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs for hotel operations as incurred. These costs were $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $0.4 million combined for our company and the Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nReceivables consist principally of trade receivables from customers and are generally unsecured and are due within 30 to 90 days. We record a provision for uncollectible accounts using the allowance method. Expected credit losses associated with trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical patterns of credit losses for aged receivables as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable, potentially uncollectible balances. When internal collection efforts on accounts have been exhausted, the accounts are written off and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts is reduced.\nDerivative Transactions\nWe at certain times enter into derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Our derivatives as of December 31, 2015, consisted of interest rate cap agreements, which we believe will help to mitigate our exposure to increasing borrowing costs under floating rate indebtedness. We have elected not to designate our interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The impact of the interest rate caps for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the consolidated financial statements was immaterial.\nReportable Segments\nWe have determined that we have one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate. Our investments in real estate generate room revenue and other income through the operation of the properties, which comprise 100% of the total consolidated/combined revenues. Management evaluates the operating performance of our investments in real estate on an individual property level, none of which represent a reportable segment.\nRevenue Performance Metrics\nWe measure hotel revenue performance by evaluating revenue metrics such as:\n \u2022 Occupancy percentage ( Occ\u201d) - Occ represents the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occ measures the utilization of our hotels' available capacity. \n \u2022 Average Daily Rate ( ADR\u201d) - ADR represents total hotel revenues divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. \n \u2022 Revenue per Available room ( RevPAR\u201d) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occ.  Occ, ADR, and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operating performance. ADR and RevPAR do not include food and beverage or other revenues generated by the hotels. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget, to prior periods and to the competitive set in the market, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis.\nOur Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nResults of Operations\nIn March of 2014 we closed on the acquisition of interests in six hotels through fee simple, leasehold and joint venture interests (the \"Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $110.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In February 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 116 hotels through fee simple and leasehold interests (the \"Grace Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion, exclusive of closing costs. In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 10 hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $150.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In November and December 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in four hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Noble and Second Noble Portfolios\") for an aggregate purchase price of $107.6 million, exclusive of closing costs. During December 2015 and January 2016, we terminated our obligation to acquire 24 additional hotels, and as a result forfeited an aggregate of $41.1 million in non-refundable deposits. In February 2016, we completed the acquisition of six hotels through fee simple interests (the \"Third Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, exclusive of closing costs. Also in February 2016, we reinstated our obligation under a previously terminated agreement with Summit, which we refer to as our Pending Acquisition, to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, we will require additional debt or equity financing to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition. Any failure to complete our Pending Acquisition could cause us to default under the reinstated purchase agreement and forfeit the $7.5 million deposit. We also do not expect to make future acquisitions unless we can obtain equity or debt financing in addition to the additional capital we need to meet our existing capital requirements.\nThe closing of our Pending Acquisition is scheduled for December 30, 2016, but Summit has the right to market and ultimately sell any or all of the hotels to be purchased to a bona fide third party purchaser without our consent at any time prior to the completion of our Pending Acquisition. Whether or not Summit engages, or is successful, in any efforts to market these hotels is beyond our control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance we will be able to complete our Pending Acquisition in whole or in part.\nSee Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of these transactions.\nFollowing amendments to our agreement with the Advisor and the limited partnership agreement of the OP on November 11, 2015, we became required to pay asset management fees, which may be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election, on a monthly basis effective October 1, 2015, equal to the cost of our assets (until we establish Estimated Per-Share NAV, then the lower of the cost of our assets and the fair value of our assets), multiplied by 0.0625%. We ceased causing units of limited partnership in our OP entitled \"Class B Units\" (\"Class B Units\") to be issued to the Advisor with respect to periods commencing on or after September 30, 2015. Historically, the issuance of Class B Units was not reflected as an expense in our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations, except for the distributions made on the associated Class B Units. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations include an expense for the asset management fee payable in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof.\nIn March of 2016, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nThe following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the comparable periods in 2014 as well as results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable periods in 2013. Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 include results from the Predecessor from January 1, 2014 to March 20, 2014.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRoom revenues for the portfolio were $420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to room revenues of $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, including results from the Predecessor period. The increase in room revenues was primarily due to acquisitions. Room revenues make up a significant majority of our total revenues, which are highly dependent on maintaining and improving Occ and ADR, which drive RevPAR.\nThe following table presents operating information of the hotels in our portfolio for the periods in which we have owned them.\n\nOur results of operations only include the results of operations of the hotels we have acquired beginning on the date of each hotel's acquisition. The following table presents pro-forma operating information of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full periods presented.\n\nThe pro-forma RevPAR growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9%, driven by growth in occupancy and ADR. Other non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage, and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees. Other non-room operating revenues, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 5.5%, over the prior year period.\nOur hotel operating expenses consist primarily of labor expenses incurred in the day-to-day operation of our hotels. Our hotels have a variety of fixed expenses, such as essential hotel staff, real estate taxes and insurance, and these expenses do not change materially even if the revenues at the hotels fluctuate. Our primary hotel operating expenses are described below:\n \u2022 Rooms expense: These costs include labor (housekeeping and rooms operation), reservation systems, room supplies, linen and laundry services. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense, due to the cost of cleaning the rooms, with additional expenses that vary with the level of service and amenities provided. \n \u2022 Food and beverage expense: These expenses primarily include labor and the cost of food and beverage. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel (for example, catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales) are the major drivers of food and beverage expense, which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue. \n \u2022 Management fees: Base management fees paid are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. Incentive management fees may be paid when operating profit or other performance metrics exceed certain threshold levels. \n \u2022 Other property-level operating costs: These expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue, such as conference center, parking, market and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative and general, sales and marketing, brand related fees, repairs, maintenance and utility costs. In addition, these expenses include real and personal property taxes and insurance, which are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue or performance at the hotels. \nTotal hotel operating expenses, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 12.2%, over the prior year period. Hotel operating expenses include certain operating costs that increase relative to increases in revenue, such as management fees and franchise fees that have a higher rate as a percentage of revenue for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, contributing to the overall increase in expenses. Additionally, 2015 was negatively impacted by disruption from and transition costs associated with the consolidation of management companies throughout 2015 as we strategically aligned markets and management companies.\nDepreciation and amortization increased approximately $64.8 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to acquisitions.\nInterest expense increased approximately $74.2 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to additional mortgage debt and the issuance of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities related to the acquisition of the Grace Portfolio.\nAcquisition and transaction related costs increased approximately $53.6 million due to costs associated with acquisitions, and forfeited deposits related to terminated acquisitions of approximately $19.1 million.\nGeneral and administrative increased approximately $9.3 million, primarily attributable to our growth and certain expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nOther income (expense) changed by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due to the loss recorded related to the change in the fair value associated with the contingent consideration payable due in connection with the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRoom revenues were $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to room revenues of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. RevPAR for the total portfolio increased 6.2% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2014. The RevPAR growth rates reflect the percentage change from the prior year's results.\nOcc, ADR and RevPAR results are presented in the following tables to reflect certain operating information for the portfolio.\n\nThe RevPAR rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is the result of the growth in ADR and occupancy, particularly at the Baltimore Courtyard due to renovations to the lobby and improvements to the restaurant and bar and higher RevPAR growth in the greater Baltimore market. These renovations also resulted in a lower occupancy at the hotel in 2013. Also contributing to the higher RevPAR was an increase in both transient and group occupied rooms at the Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy overall in the Atlanta market and the efforts of Crestline to improve the operations of the hotel which included appointing a new hotel general manager. Occupancy also increased at the Westin Virginia Beach primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy in the Virginia Beach market. These increases were offset by a decrease in RevPAR at Stratford Homewood Suites which had a higher occupancy than normal in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of people displaced from their homes by Hurricane Sandy.\nOther non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage (16.6% and 15.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees (8.7% and 7.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively). The increase compared to 2013 is primarily driven by higher occupancy and group related revenue, such as group meetings and conferences, at the Georgia Tech Hotel. Hotel operating expenses increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 mainly due to increased room and other property-level expenses at the Baltimore Courtyard and Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted primarily by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by acquisition and transaction related costs, increases in restricted cash, and increases in prepaids and other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $772.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to acquisitions and capital investments in our properties.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities was $680.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily impacted by proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from mortgage notes payable, partially offset by redemptions of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and repayments of promissory and mortgage notes payable.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.7 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by a net loss of $14.8 million, which was, in turn, largely the result of the amount of transaction fees related to the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio and the Grace Portfolio and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.9 million as a result of prepaid acquisition expenses for the Grace Portfolio and the receivable from the Former Dealer Manager for the shares sold on the last day of the year of $1.6 million. These were offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.8 million, an increase in due to affiliates of $5.0 million, mainly related to services provided to us related to the Grace Portfolio and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.0 million related to the deferred payment and contingent consideration from the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $122.1 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio for $41.4 million, the deposit on the Grace Portfolio of $75.0 million, an increase in restricted cash of $2.0 million related to requirements of the new mortgage note payable and $3.7 million of improvements at the properties, primarily due to renovations at the Stratford Homewood Suites.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $263.6 million. Cash inflows were primarily driven by proceeds from the mortgage note payable of $45.5 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $249.6 million. These were offset by the payment of offering costs of $28.1 million and the payment of deferred financing fees of $2.6 million. During the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015, we received proceeds of $40.5 million from an affiliate note payable to fund the deposit on the Grace Acquisition which was then repaid in full.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $46.8 million. Under certain of our debt obligations, we are required to maintain minimum liquidity of $20 million to comply with financial covenants and we expect to satisfy this covenant through liquidity we maintain at individual hotels as well as through other sources.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO and, on November 18, 2015, the Former Dealer Manager suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire an aggregate of 44 hotels from three different independent parties (the SN Acquisitions\u201d), including Summit, for an aggregate purchase price of $740.3 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired 14 of the 44 hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $257.7 million, which was funded with $15.6 million previously paid as a deposit, $76.9 million from the proceeds of our IPO, and $165.2 million from an advance under the SN Term Loan. Following the suspension of our IPO, our failure to obtain financing alternatives to our IPO caused us to forfeit $19.1 million in earnest money deposits with respect to 15 hotels during December 2015 and $22.0 million in earnest money deposits with respect to nine hotels during January 2016 because we did not have sufficient capital available to complete the SN Acquisitions scheduled to close during those periods. During February 2016, we acquired six hotels from Summit for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, which (together with certain closing costs) was funded with (i) $70.4 million from an advance, secured by a mortgage on the hotels acquired, under the SN Term Loan, (ii) $20.0 million in proceeds from a loan from Summit (the Summit Loan\u201d), and (iii) $18.5 million previously paid as an earnest money deposit. Also on February 11, 2016, we agreed to reinstate our obligation to complete our Pending Acquisition that had previously been terminated to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million from Summit, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million. The deposit was also financed with the proceeds from the Summit Loan.\nOur major capital requirements during 2016 include capital expenditures required pursuant to our franchise agreements and related escrows required under our indebtedness, interest and principal payments under our indebtedness, interest payments on\nthe Grace Preferred Equity Interests and asset management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Advisor. We are also required to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition (including amounts we intend to finance), which is scheduled to occur in December 2016. Failure to do so could cause us to forfeit up to $7.5 million in non-refundable earnest money deposits previously paid.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash.\nConcurrently with this change in our distribution policy, we amended (the Amendment\u201d) our agreement with our Advisor (as amended, the Advisory Agreement\u201d) to provide us with the right to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under the Advisory Agreement in shares of our common stock for the period of time beginning on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, commencing on the date (the Trigger\u201d) that the elimination of the Company's payment of cash distributions is insufficient to provide adequate liquidity levels consistent with assumptions mutually agreed to in good faith by our independent directors and our Advisor from time to time (the Relief Period\u201d), subject to termination on the earlier of: (a) the date on which we have completed a public or private offering, which provides net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such offering; (b) the date on which we have completed an asset sale or borrowing, which provides net proceeds in excess of $50.0 million, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction; (c) the date that our board of directors declares a distribution all or a portion of which is payable in cash; (d) a change of control (as defined in the Amendment), any restructuring of our debt or preferred stock that results in net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction or such transaction results in the reduction in other cash usage by us during the Relief Period in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, or a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of substantially all of our assets; (e) termination of the Advisory Agreement; or (f) the date on which the amendment to our charter, as described below, is not approved by our stockholders. If an event described in items (d) or (e) above occurs, we have agreed to redeem any shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above for cash at the original issuance price. Pursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed to certain registration rights for the benefit of the Advisor with respect to the resale of the shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above.\nPrior to the Amendment and for asset management services for periods after September 30, 2015, we paid asset management fees in cash or shares of common stock, or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election.\nPursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed, subject to approval of our stockholders of an amendment to our charter which we have agreed to present to our stockholders at our 2016 annual meeting, to extend the term of the Advisory Agreement to June 1, 2017 and that the notice period for terminating the Advisory Agreement will be ninety (90) days' notice instead of sixty (60) days' notice if the Trigger occurs prior to an expiration of the term.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nIf obtained, any additional debt or equity financing could be on terms that would not be favorable to us or our stockholders, including high interest rates, in the case of debt financing, and substantial dilution, in the case of equity issuances or convertible securities. Moreover, because we are required to use 35% of the proceeds from the issuance of interests in us or any of our subsidiaries, to redeem the Grace Preferred Equity Interests at par, up to a maximum of $350 million in redemptions for any 12-month period, it may be more difficult to obtain equity financing from an alternative source in an amount required to meet our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $294.5 million of liquidation value remained outstanding under the Grace Preferred Equity Interests.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $1.4 billion in indebtedness plus an additional $294.5 million in liquidation value of Grace Preferred Equity Interests (which are treated as indebtedness for accounting purposes), all of which was incurred in acquiring the real properties we currently own, substantially all of which have been pledged as security under our indebtedness. If our cash flow from operations and other available sources are insufficient to fund interest and principal under our indebtedness or make mandatory redemptions of the Grace Preferred Equity Interests we could lose control of our properties.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, our ability to achieve our original investment objective of a loan-to-value ratio of 50% has been adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, our loan-to-value ratio, including the Grace Preferred Equity Interests, was 75%, and our loan-to-value ratio excluding the Grace Preferred Equity Interests was 57%.\nUnder our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness may not exceed 300% of our total net assets\u201d (which is generally defined in our charter as our assets less our liabilities) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally equal to approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.\nPrior to our entry into agreements related to our acquisition and financing activities during 2014 and 2015, a majority of our independent directors waived the total portfolio leverage requirement of our charter with respect to acquisition and financing activities should such total portfolio leverage exceed 300% of our total \"net assets\" in connection with such acquisition and financing activities. Our total portfolio leverage (which includes the Grace Preferred Equity Interests) has significantly exceeded this 300% limit at times. As of December 31, 2015, our total portfolio leverage was 232%.\nWe are also subject to covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios and negative pledges, in our existing indebtedness that restrict our ability to make future borrowings.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted the SRP that enables stockholders, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to sell their shares to us. On January 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved an amendment and restatement to the SRP. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, below. Under the SRP, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares of common stock. Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors and generally will be made semiannually. We fund repurchases from proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the DRIP as well as any reservation of funds our board of directors, in its sole discretion, makes available for this purpose.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we did not accept all of the repurchase requests we received.\nThe following table reflects the cumulative number of shares repurchased as of and during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\n________________________\n (1) As permitted under the SRP, the board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the three months ended December 31, 2015, the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount equal to 1.0% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, representing less than all the shares validly submitted for repurchase during the three months ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, repurchases of 28,264 shares for $0.6 million at an average repurchase price per share of $23.44 (including all shares submitted for death or disability) were completed in January 2016, while repurchase requests for 64,454 shares for $1.5 million at an average price per share of $23.48 were not fulfilled. The accrual for repurchase requests that were approved but not completed during the three months ended December 31, 2015 is reflected in the accounts payable and accrued expenses line of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were no other unfulfilled share repurchases for the period from July 25, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2015.  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may not be fully informative.\nBecause of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations or property acquisitions, has resulted in acquisition fees and expenses being expensed under GAAP. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings and typically paying acquisition fees.\nBecause of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year over year, both before and after we have deployed all of our Offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisitions fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses, amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.\nWe believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders (although we are not currently paying cash distributions). FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on July 25, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (\"REIT\") beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We were formed primarily to acquire lodging properties in the midscale limited service, extended stay, select service, upscale select service, and upper upscale full service segments within the hospitality sector. As of December 31, 2015, we had acquired or had an interest in a total of 136 hotels with a total of 16,644 guestrooms located in 32 states. As of December 31, 2015, all but one of our hotels operated under a franchise or license agreement with a national brand owned by one of Hilton Worldwide, Inc., Marriott International, Inc., Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and Intercontinental Hotels Group or one of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. During February 2016, we completed an acquisition comprising investments in six additional hotels with a total of 707 guestrooms located in two states, all of which were operated under a franchise or license agreement with one of our national brands.\nOn January 7, 2014, we commenced our primary initial public offering (\"IPO\" or the \"Offering\") on a \"reasonable best efforts\" basis of up to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-190698), as well as up to 21,052,631 shares of common stock available pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP\") under which our common stockholders could elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO, and, on November 18, 2015, Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the \"Former Dealer Manager\"), the dealer manager of our IPO, suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash. Concurrently with this change to our distribution policy, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding and had received total gross proceeds of approximately $902.9 million, including shares issued under the DRIP.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted through American Realty Capital Hospitality Operating Partnership, L.P. (the \"OP\"), a Delaware limited partnership. We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interest in the OP entitled OP Units\u201d (\"OP Units\"). Additionally, our Advisor contributed $2,020 to the OP in exchange for 90 OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. The holders of OP Units have the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of common stock of us in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP. The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets.\nOur Former Dealer Manager served as the dealer manager of our IPO and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide us with various services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer\nManager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Capital, the parent of our Sponsor, and AR Global.\nWe have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage certain aspects of our affairs on a day-to-day basis. American Realty Capital Hospitality Properties, LLC or one of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Property Manager\"), serves as our property manager and the Property Manager has retained Crestline Hotels & Resorts, LLC (\"Crestline\") to provide services, including locating investments, negotiating financing and operating certain hotel assets in our portfolio.\nThe Advisor, the Property Manager and Crestline are under common control with AR Global and AR Capital, as a result of which they are related parties, and each of which has received or will receive compensation, fees and other expense reimbursements from us for services related to our IPO and the investment and management of our assets.\nWe, directly or indirectly through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, enter into agreements with the Property Manager, which, in turn, engages Crestline or a third-party sub-property manager to manage our hotel properties. Crestline is a leading hospitality management company in the United States, and as of December 31, 2015, had 100 hotels and 15,104 rooms under management in 27 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2015, 66 of our hotels and 8,937 rooms were managed by Crestline, and 70 of our hotels and 7,707 rooms were managed by third-party sub-property managers.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation/Combination and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements include our accounts and our subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as percentage ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nThe Predecessor represents hospitality assets and operations owned by Barcel\u00f3 Crestline Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (\"BCC\"), which historically have been maintained in various legal entities. Historically, financial statements have not been prepared for the Predecessor as a discrete stand-alone entity. The accompanying consolidated/combined financial statements for the Predecessor as of December 31, 2014, for the period from January 1 to March 20, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been derived from the historical accounting records of BCC and reflect the assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses directly attributable to the Predecessor, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management, to present the combined financial position, results of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Predecessor on a stand-alone basis.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, the useful lives of real estate and real estate taxes, as applicable.\nReal Estate Investments\nWe allocate the purchase price of properties acquired in real estate investments to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment. We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the property value. Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are based on purchase price allocation studies performed by independent third parties or our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, as applicable, are typically related to contracts, including operating lease agreements, ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements, which will be recorded at fair value. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.\nInvestments in real estate that are not considered to be business combinations under GAAP are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of our assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold interests.\nThe Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nBelow-Market Lease\nThe below-market lease intangible is based on the difference between the market rent and the contractual rent and is discounted to a present value using an interest rate reflecting our current assessment of the risk associated with the leases assumed at acquisition. Acquired lease intangible assets are amortized over the remaining lease term. The amortization of a below-market lease is recorded as an increase to rent expense on the consolidated/combined statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWhen circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition. The estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. No such impairment losses were recorded in the periods presented.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of amounts required under mortgage agreements for future capital improvements to owned assets, future interest and property tax payments and cash flow deposits while subject to mortgage agreement restrictions. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, changes in restricted cash caused by changes to the amount needed for future capital improvements are treated as investing activities, changes related to future debt service payments are treated as financing activities, and changes related to real estate tax payments and excess cash flow deposits are treated as operating activities.\nDeferred Financing Fees\nDeferred financing fees represent commitment fees, legal fees and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing. These fees are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred financing fees are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not be successful.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810, Consolidation contains the guidance surrounding the definition of variable interest entities (\"VIE\"), the definition of variable interests and the consolidation rules surrounding VIEs. In general, VIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We have variable interests in VIEs through our investments in entities which own the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center (the \"Westin Virginia Beach\") and the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg.\nOnce it is determined that we hold a variable interest in an entity, GAAP requires that we perform a qualitative analysis to determine (i) which entity has the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The entity that has both of these characteristics is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nWe hold an interest in BSE/AH Blacksburg Hotel, LLC (the \"HGI Blacksburg JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Hilton Garden Inn Blacksburg, and an interest in TCA Block 7 Hotel, LLC (the \"Westin Virginia Beach JV\"), an entity that owns the assets of the Westin Virginia Beach.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2015, upon the acquisition of an additional equity interest in the HGI Blacksburg JV, we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary, with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, and therefore consolidated the entity in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition (See Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have concluded we are not the primary beneficiary with the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the Westin Virginia Beach JV, and have therefore not consolidated the entity. We have accounted for the entity under the equity method of accounting and included it in investments in unconsolidated entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nHotel revenue is recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel services.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our tax year ended December 31, 2014. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, and must comply with various other organizational and operational requirements. We generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property tax and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Our hotels are leased to taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\") which are owned by the OP. The TRSs are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is \"more-likely-than-not\" that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement in order to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.\nEarnings/Loss per Share\nWe calculate basic income or loss per share by dividing net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average shares of its common stock outstanding for a respective period. Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested stock awards, except when doing so would be anti-dilutive.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in an orderly transaction on the measurement date. The market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is known as the principal market. When no principal market exists, the most advantageous market is used. This is the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the price that maximizes the amount that would be received or minimizes the amount that would be paid. Fair value is based on assumptions market participants would make in pricing the asset or liability. Generally, fair value is based on observable quoted market prices or derived from observable market data when such market prices or data are available. When such prices or inputs are not available, the reporting entity should use valuation models.\nOur financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized based on the priority of the inputs used to measure fair value. The inputs used in measuring fair value are categorized into three levels, as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or models based on valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the investment. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs for hotel operations as incurred. These costs were $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $0.4 million combined for our company and the Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nReceivables consist principally of trade receivables from customers and are generally unsecured and are due within 30 to 90 days. We record a provision for uncollectible accounts using the allowance method. Expected credit losses associated with trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical patterns of credit losses for aged receivables as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable, potentially uncollectible balances. When internal collection efforts on accounts have been exhausted, the accounts are written off and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts is reduced.\nDerivative Transactions\nWe at certain times enter into derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Our derivatives as of December 31, 2015, consisted of interest rate cap agreements, which we believe will help to mitigate our exposure to increasing borrowing costs under floating rate indebtedness. We have elected not to designate our interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The impact of the interest rate caps for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the consolidated financial statements was immaterial.\nReportable Segments\nWe have determined that we have one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate. Our investments in real estate generate room revenue and other income through the operation of the properties, which comprise 100% of the total consolidated/combined revenues. Management evaluates the operating performance of our investments in real estate on an individual property level, none of which represent a reportable segment.\nRevenue Performance Metrics\nWe measure hotel revenue performance by evaluating revenue metrics such as:\n \u2022 Occupancy percentage ( Occ\u201d) - Occ represents the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occ measures the utilization of our hotels' available capacity. \n \u2022 Average Daily Rate ( ADR\u201d) - ADR represents total hotel revenues divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. \n \u2022 Revenue per Available room ( RevPAR\u201d) - RevPAR is the product of ADR and Occ.  Occ, ADR, and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operating performance. ADR and RevPAR do not include food and beverage or other revenues generated by the hotels. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget, to prior periods and to the competitive set in the market, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis.\nOur Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel property construction, and the pricing strategies of competitors. In addition, our Occ, ADR and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and brands.\nResults of Operations\nIn March of 2014 we closed on the acquisition of interests in six hotels through fee simple, leasehold and joint venture interests (the \"Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $110.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In February 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 116 hotels through fee simple and leasehold interests (the \"Grace Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion, exclusive of closing costs. In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in 10 hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $150.1 million, exclusive of closing costs. In November and December 2015, we closed on the acquisition of interests in four hotels through fee simple interests (the \"First Noble and Second Noble Portfolios\") for an aggregate purchase price of $107.6 million, exclusive of closing costs. During December 2015 and January 2016, we terminated our obligation to acquire 24 additional hotels, and as a result forfeited an aggregate of $41.1 million in non-refundable deposits. In February 2016, we completed the acquisition of six hotels through fee simple interests (the \"Third Summit Portfolio\") for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, exclusive of closing costs. Also in February 2016, we reinstated our obligation under a previously terminated agreement with Summit, which we refer to as our Pending Acquisition, to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, we will require additional debt or equity financing to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition. Any failure to complete our Pending Acquisition could cause us to default under the reinstated purchase agreement and forfeit the $7.5 million deposit. We also do not expect to make future acquisitions unless we can obtain equity or debt financing in addition to the additional capital we need to meet our existing capital requirements.\nThe closing of our Pending Acquisition is scheduled for December 30, 2016, but Summit has the right to market and ultimately sell any or all of the hotels to be purchased to a bona fide third party purchaser without our consent at any time prior to the completion of our Pending Acquisition. Whether or not Summit engages, or is successful, in any efforts to market these hotels is beyond our control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance we will be able to complete our Pending Acquisition in whole or in part.\nSee Note 3 - Business Combinations to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of these transactions.\nFollowing amendments to our agreement with the Advisor and the limited partnership agreement of the OP on November 11, 2015, we became required to pay asset management fees, which may be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election, on a monthly basis effective October 1, 2015, equal to the cost of our assets (until we establish Estimated Per-Share NAV, then the lower of the cost of our assets and the fair value of our assets), multiplied by 0.0625%. We ceased causing units of limited partnership in our OP entitled \"Class B Units\" (\"Class B Units\") to be issued to the Advisor with respect to periods commencing on or after September 30, 2015. Historically, the issuance of Class B Units was not reflected as an expense in our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations, except for the distributions made on the associated Class B Units. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Consolidated/Combined Statements of Operations include an expense for the asset management fee payable in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof.\nIn March of 2016, we amended our agreement with our Advisor to give us the right, for a period commencing on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions, to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under our agreement with our Advisor in shares of our common stock.\nThe following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the comparable periods in 2014 as well as results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the comparable periods in 2013. Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 include results from the Predecessor from January 1, 2014 to March 20, 2014.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRoom revenues for the portfolio were $420.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to room revenues of $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, including results from the Predecessor period. The increase in room revenues was primarily due to acquisitions. Room revenues make up a significant majority of our total revenues, which are highly dependent on maintaining and improving Occ and ADR, which drive RevPAR.\nThe following table presents operating information of the hotels in our portfolio for the periods in which we have owned them.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur results of operations only include the results of operations of the hotels we have acquired beginning on the date of each hotel's acquisition.

Other non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage, and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees. Other non-room operating revenues, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 5.5%, over the prior year period.\nOur hotel operating expenses consist primarily of labor expenses incurred in the day-to-day operation of our hotels. Our hotels have a variety of fixed expenses, such as essential hotel staff, real estate taxes and insurance, and these expenses do not change materially even if the revenues at the hotels fluctuate. Our primary hotel operating expenses are described below:\n \u2022 Rooms expense: These costs include labor (housekeeping and rooms operation), reservation systems, room supplies, linen and laundry services. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense, due to the cost of cleaning the rooms, with additional expenses that vary with the level of service and amenities provided. \n \u2022 Food and beverage expense: These expenses primarily include labor and the cost of food and beverage. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel (for example, catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales) are the major drivers of food and beverage expense, which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue. \n \u2022 Management fees: Base management fees paid are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. Incentive management fees may be paid when operating profit or other performance metrics exceed certain threshold levels. \n \u2022 Other property-level operating costs: These expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue, such as conference center, parking, market and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative and general, sales and marketing, brand related fees, repairs, maintenance and utility costs. In addition, these expenses include real and personal property taxes and insurance, which are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenue or performance at the hotels. \nTotal hotel operating expenses, including the results of the hotels in our portfolio as if we had owned each hotel in our portfolio for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, increased approximately 12.2%, over the prior year period. Hotel operating expenses include certain operating costs that increase relative to increases in revenue, such as management fees and franchise fees that have a higher rate as a percentage of revenue for the full years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, contributing to the overall increase in expenses. Additionally, 2015 was negatively impacted by disruption from and transition costs associated with the consolidation of management companies throughout 2015 as we strategically aligned markets and management companies.\nDepreciation and amortization increased approximately $64.8 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to acquisitions.\nInterest expense increased approximately $74.2 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due primarily to additional mortgage debt and the issuance of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities related to the acquisition of the Grace Portfolio.\nAcquisition and transaction related costs increased approximately $53.6 million due to costs associated with acquisitions, and forfeited deposits related to terminated acquisitions of approximately $19.1 million.\nGeneral and administrative increased approximately $9.3 million, primarily attributable to our growth and certain expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nOther income (expense) changed by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended 2015, compared to the prior year, due to the loss recorded related to the change in the fair value associated with the contingent consideration payable due in connection with the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRoom revenues were $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to room revenues of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. RevPAR for the total portfolio increased 6.2% year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2014. The RevPAR growth rates reflect the percentage change from the prior year's results.\nOcc, ADR and RevPAR results are presented in the following tables to reflect certain operating information for the portfolio.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occ\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RevPAR growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe RevPAR rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is the result of the growth in ADR and occupancy, particularly at the Baltimore Courtyard due to renovations to the lobby and improvements to the restaurant and bar and higher RevPAR growth in the greater Baltimore market. These renovations also resulted in a lower occupancy at the hotel in 2013. Also contributing to the higher RevPAR was an increase in both transient and group occupied rooms at the Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy overall in the Atlanta market and the efforts of Crestline to improve the operations of the hotel which included appointing a new hotel general manager. Occupancy also increased at the Westin Virginia Beach primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy in the Virginia Beach market. These increases were offset by a decrease in RevPAR at Stratford Homewood Suites which had a higher occupancy than normal in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of people displaced from their homes by Hurricane Sandy.\nOther non-room operating revenues for the portfolio include food and beverage (16.6% and 15.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) and other ancillary revenues such as conference center, market, parking, telephone and cancellation fees (8.7% and 7.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively). The increase compared to 2013 is primarily driven by higher occupancy and group related revenue, such as group meetings and conferences, at the Georgia Tech Hotel. Hotel operating expenses increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 mainly due to increased room and other property-level expenses at the Baltimore Courtyard and Georgia Tech Hotel as a result of higher occupancy.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted primarily by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by acquisition and transaction related costs, increases in restricted cash, and increases in prepaids and other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $772.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to acquisitions and capital investments in our properties.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities was $680.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily impacted by proceeds from the issuance of common stock and proceeds from mortgage notes payable, partially offset by redemptions of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and repayments of promissory and mortgage notes payable.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.7 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by a net loss of $14.8 million, which was, in turn, largely the result of the amount of transaction fees related to the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio and the Grace Portfolio and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.9 million as a result of prepaid acquisition expenses for the Grace Portfolio and the receivable from the Former Dealer Manager for the shares sold on the last day of the year of $1.6 million. These were offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.8 million, an increase in due to affiliates of $5.0 million, mainly related to services provided to us related to the Grace Portfolio and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.0 million related to the deferred payment and contingent consideration from the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $122.1 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by the acquisition of the Barcel\u00f3 Portfolio for $41.4 million, the deposit on the Grace Portfolio of $75.0 million, an increase in restricted cash of $2.0 million related to requirements of the new mortgage note payable and $3.7 million of improvements at the properties, primarily due to renovations at the Stratford Homewood Suites.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $263.6 million. Cash inflows were primarily driven by proceeds from the mortgage note payable of $45.5 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $249.6 million. These were offset by the payment of offering costs of $28.1 million and the payment of deferred financing fees of $2.6 million. During the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015, we received proceeds of $40.5 million from an affiliate note payable to fund the deposit on the Grace Acquisition which was then repaid in full.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $46.8 million. Under certain of our debt obligations, we are required to maintain minimum liquidity of $20 million to comply with financial covenants and we expect to satisfy this covenant through liquidity we maintain at individual hotels as well as through other sources.\nOn November 15, 2015, we suspended our IPO and, on November 18, 2015, the Former Dealer Manager suspended sales activities, effective immediately. On December 31, 2015, we terminated the Former Dealer Manager as the dealer manager of our IPO. Prior to suspension of our IPO, we depended, and expected to continue to depend, in substantial part on proceeds from our IPO to meet our major capital requirements. Because we do not expect we will resume our IPO, we will require funds in addition to operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements.\nIn June 2015, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire an aggregate of 44 hotels from three different independent parties (the SN Acquisitions\u201d), including Summit, for an aggregate purchase price of $740.3 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired 14 of the 44 hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $257.7 million, which was funded with $15.6 million previously paid as a deposit, $76.9 million from the proceeds of our IPO, and $165.2 million from an advance under the SN Term Loan. Following the suspension of our IPO, our failure to obtain financing alternatives to our IPO caused us to forfeit $19.1 million in earnest money deposits with respect to 15 hotels during December 2015 and $22.0 million in earnest money deposits with respect to nine hotels during January 2016 because we did not have sufficient capital available to complete the SN Acquisitions scheduled to close during those periods. During February 2016, we acquired six hotels from Summit for an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million, which (together with certain closing costs) was funded with (i) $70.4 million from an advance, secured by a mortgage on the hotels acquired, under the SN Term Loan, (ii) $20.0 million in proceeds from a loan from Summit (the Summit Loan\u201d), and (iii) $18.5 million previously paid as an earnest money deposit. Also on February 11, 2016, we agreed to reinstate our obligation to complete our Pending Acquisition that had previously been terminated to purchase ten hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $89.1 million from Summit, and made a new purchase price deposit of $7.5 million. The deposit was also financed with the proceeds from the Summit Loan.\nOur major capital requirements during 2016 include capital expenditures required pursuant to our franchise agreements and related escrows required under our indebtedness, interest and principal payments under our indebtedness, interest payments on\nthe Grace Preferred Equity Interests and asset management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Advisor. We are also required to fund up to $81.6 million in closing consideration for our Pending Acquisition (including amounts we intend to finance), which is scheduled to occur in December 2016. Failure to do so could cause us to forfeit up to $7.5 million in non-refundable earnest money deposits previously paid.\nBecause we require funds in addition to our operating cash flow and cash on hand to meet our capital requirements, beginning with distributions payable with respect to April 2016 we will pay distributions to our stockholders in shares of common stock instead of cash.\nConcurrently with this change in our distribution policy, we amended (the Amendment\u201d) our agreement with our Advisor (as amended, the Advisory Agreement\u201d) to provide us with the right to pay up to $500,000 per month of asset management fees payable to our Advisor under the Advisory Agreement in shares of our common stock for the period of time beginning on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017, commencing on the date (the Trigger\u201d) that the elimination of the Company's payment of cash distributions is insufficient to provide adequate liquidity levels consistent with assumptions mutually agreed to in good faith by our independent directors and our Advisor from time to time (the Relief Period\u201d), subject to termination on the earlier of: (a) the date on which we have completed a public or private offering, which provides net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such offering; (b) the date on which we have completed an asset sale or borrowing, which provides net proceeds in excess of $50.0 million, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction; (c) the date that our board of directors declares a distribution all or a portion of which is payable in cash; (d) a change of control (as defined in the Amendment), any restructuring of our debt or preferred stock that results in net proceeds in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, after repayment or redemption of any indebtedness or preferred stock which is repayable or redeemable out of the proceeds of such transaction or such transaction results in the reduction in other cash usage by us during the Relief Period in excess of $500,000 multiplied by the remaining months prior to June 1, 2017, or a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of substantially all of our assets; (e) termination of the Advisory Agreement; or (f) the date on which the amendment to our charter, as described below, is not approved by our stockholders. If an event described in items (d) or (e) above occurs, we have agreed to redeem any shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above for cash at the original issuance price. Pursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed to certain registration rights for the benefit of the Advisor with respect to the resale of the shares of common stock issued by us to the Advisor as payment of asset management fees as described above.\nPrior to the Amendment and for asset management services for periods after September 30, 2015, we paid asset management fees in cash or shares of common stock, or a combination of both, at the Advisor's election.\nPursuant to the Amendment, we also agreed, subject to approval of our stockholders of an amendment to our charter which we have agreed to present to our stockholders at our 2016 annual meeting, to extend the term of the Advisory Agreement to June 1, 2017 and that the notice period for terminating the Advisory Agreement will be ninety (90) days' notice instead of sixty (60) days' notice if the Trigger occurs prior to an expiration of the term.\nWe believe the changes to our distribution policy and amendments to our agreement with our Advisor to pay the asset management fee in shares of our common stock will provide adequate liquidity to satisfy our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but these measures may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for this period.\nIf obtained, any additional debt or equity financing could be on terms that would not be favorable to us or our stockholders, including high interest rates, in the case of debt financing, and substantial dilution, in the case of equity issuances or convertible securities. Moreover, because we are required to use 35% of the proceeds from the issuance of interests in us or any of our subsidiaries, to redeem the Grace Preferred Equity Interests at par, up to a maximum of $350 million in redemptions for any 12-month period, it may be more difficult to obtain equity financing from an alternative source in an amount required to meet our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $294.5 million of liquidation value remained outstanding under the Grace Preferred Equity Interests.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $1.4 billion in indebtedness plus an additional $294.5 million in liquidation value of Grace Preferred Equity Interests (which are treated as indebtedness for accounting purposes), all of which was incurred in acquiring the real properties we currently own, substantially all of which have been pledged as security under our indebtedness. If our cash flow from operations and other available sources are insufficient to fund interest and principal under our indebtedness or make mandatory redemptions of the Grace Preferred Equity Interests we could lose control of our properties.\nBecause we have raised less proceeds in our IPO than originally contemplated, our ability to achieve our original investment objective of a loan-to-value ratio of 50% has been adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, our loan-to-value ratio, including the Grace Preferred Equity Interests, was 75%, and our loan-to-value ratio excluding the Grace Preferred Equity Interests was 57%.\nUnder our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness may not exceed 300% of our total net assets\u201d (which is generally defined in our charter as our assets less our liabilities) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally equal to approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.\nPrior to our entry into agreements related to our acquisition and financing activities during 2014 and 2015, a majority of our independent directors waived the total portfolio leverage requirement of our charter with respect to acquisition and financing activities should such total portfolio leverage exceed 300% of our total \"net assets\" in connection with such acquisition and financing activities. Our total portfolio leverage (which includes the Grace Preferred Equity Interests) has significantly exceeded this 300% limit at times. As of December 31, 2015, our total portfolio leverage was 232%.\nWe are also subject to covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios and negative pledges, in our existing indebtedness that restrict our ability to make future borrowings.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur board of directors has adopted the SRP that enables stockholders, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to sell their shares to us. On January 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved an amendment and restatement to the SRP. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, below. Under the SRP, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares of common stock. Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors and generally will be made semiannually. We fund repurchases from proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the DRIP as well as any reservation of funds our board of directors, in its sole discretion, makes available for this purpose.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we did not accept all of the repurchase requests we received.\nThe following table reflects the cumulative number of shares repurchased as of and during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Shares Repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Price per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended December 31, 2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\n (1) As permitted under the SRP, the board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the three months ended December 31, 2015, the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount equal to 1.0% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, representing less than all the shares validly submitted for repurchase during the three months ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, repurchases of 28,264 shares for $0.6 million at an average repurchase price per share of $23.44 (including all shares submitted for death or disability) were completed in January 2016, while repurchase requests for 64,454 shares for $1.5 million at an average price per share of $23.48 were not fulfilled. The accrual for repurchase requests that were approved but not completed during the three months ended December 31, 2015 is reflected in the accounts payable and accrued expenses line of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were no other unfulfilled share repurchases for the period from July 25, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2015.  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may not be fully informative.\nBecause of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper\u201d). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations or property acquisitions, has resulted in acquisition fees and expenses being expensed under GAAP. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings and typically paying acquisition fees.\nBecause of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REITs, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year over year, both before and after we have deployed all of our Offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisitions fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, ADR, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses, amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.\nWe believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders (although we are not currently paying cash distributions). FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and"}
