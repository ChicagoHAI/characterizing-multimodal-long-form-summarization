This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCLN) is a United States ( US\u201d)-headquartered, China-focused, specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders. We are focused on continuing to grow our revenue and profitability. Our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the People's Republic of China ( China\u201d or PRC\u201d) where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through many years of experience marketing our lead product, ZADAXIN\u00ae (thymalfasin). In addition, we have an established product promotion business model with large pharmaceutical partners and we are focused on establishing profitability in all of these collaborations. We believe our sales and marketing strengths position us to benefit from the long-term expansion of the pharmaceutical market in China. The Chinese pharmaceutical market currently ranks second among the global pharmaceutical markets, and had an estimated worth of $105 billion in 2014. It is forecasted to increase significantly to $200 billion by 2020. We seek to expand our presence in China and increase revenues by growing sales and profits of our current product portfolio, launching new products from our development pipeline, adding new, profitable product services agreements and leveraging our strong cash position to in-license additional products.\nWe operate in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers: 1) China and 2) the Rest of the World, which includes our US and Hong Kong operations.\nWe have two categories of revenues: product sales revenues\u201d and promotion services revenues.\u201d Our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in-licensed products, including our lead product, ZADAXIN; DC Bead\u00ae, a product for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors, for which we initiated sales and recorded product revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2015, and products from Pfizer International Trading (Shanghai) Ltd. ( Pfizer\u201d). Through June 30, 2015, our product sales revenues also included Aggrastat\u00ae, an intervention cardiology product launched in China in 2009, in-licensed from Cardiome Pharma Corp ( Cardiome\u201d). In August 2015, we and Cardiome mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, thereby terminating our exclusive distribution rights in China, and returning all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nZADAXIN has the highest margins in our portfolio as it is a premium product sold exclusively by SciClone. In addition, we anticipate that new marketed products, when and if introduced, can increase the future revenues and profitability of our pharmaceutical business in China over the coming years. Our promotion services revenues\u201d result primarily from fees we receive for exclusively promoting products in China for Baxter International, Inc. ( Baxter\u201d). We recognize promotion services revenues as a percentage of our collaborators' product sales revenue for these exclusively promoted products. Over time, as additional proprietary or in-licensed products come to the market, we aim to shift our product mix towards those products providing higher margins for us.\nZADAXIN is approved in over 30 countries and may be used for the treatment of HBV, HCV, and certain cancers, and as an immune system enhancer according to the local regulatory approvals we have in these countries. In China, thymalfasin is included in the treatment guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health ( MOH\u201d) for liver cancer, as well as guidelines for treatment of chronic HBV (issued by both the Chinese Medical Association and the Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver) and invasive fungal infections of critically ill patients (issued by the Chinese Medical Association). Our sales force is focused on increasing sales to the country's largest hospitals (class 3A with over 500 beds) as well as mid-size hospitals (class 2A). These hospitals serve Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities located mostly in the eastern part of China, which are the largest and generally have the most affluent populations. We are widening our market strategies by piloting e-commerce approaches to reach customers. We are also seeking to expand the indications for which ZADAXIN could be used, including sepsis.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe initiated sales and recorded our first product revenue from DC Bead in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The China Food and Drug Administration had approved the registration of DC Bead for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors in August 2014. DC Bead may be used to treat liver cancer, a large and growing indication in China, and we believe our oncology sales team and academic marketing liaisons have established high quality relationships with medical professionals and institutions that specialize in cancer treatment, which we believe will be a valuable asset as we continue commercial sales of DC Bead. BioCompatibles UK Ltd. ( BTG\u201d) and SciClone previously entered into an agreement granting SciClone exclusive licensing and distribution rights to DC Bead in China. Under the agreement, we are purchasing DC Bead product from BTG.\nWe are also pursuing the registration of several other therapeutic products in China. These include: Loramyc\u00ae, a mucoadhesive tablet formulation of miconazole lauriad to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis; and RapidFilm\u00ae, an oral film formulation of ondansetron to treat nausea induced by chemotherapy.\nOur agreement with Baxter is for a 5-year term, through December 2017, and our agreement with Pfizer is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. We are pursuing additional agreements to generate additional revenue. We continue to seek in-licensing arrangements for well-differentiated products at various stages of development that, if not yet approved, have a defined regulatory approval pathway in China. Our objective is to in-license products that provide us with higher margins, augmenting our product sales revenue and profitability, and we continue to explore opportunities to optimize our promotion services revenues.\nIn May 2015, Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ( Theravance Biopharma\u201d) granted SciClone exclusive development and commercialization rights to VIBATIV\u00ae (telavancin) in China, as well as the Hong Kong SAR, the Macau SAR, Taiwan and Vietnam, in exchange for upfront and regulatory milestone payments totaling $6 million. SciClone will be responsible for all aspects of development and commercialization in the partnered regions, including pre- and post-launch activities and product registration. SciClone will initially develop VIBATIV for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, and additional indications may include complicated skin and skin structure infections and potentially bacteremia. Theravance Biopharma will sell to SciClone all clinical and commercial product required to develop and commercialize VIBATIV in China and our other licensed territories.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with The Medicines Company for two cardiovascular products in China. The partnership includes an agreement granting us a license and the exclusive rights in China to promote two products including 1) Angiomax\u00ae (bivalirudin) for Injection, an anticoagulant indicated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) and in patients with, or at risk of, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome undergoing PCI for which a Phase 3 registration trial was completed in China and is currently under review by the China Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval, and 2) Cleviprex\u00ae (clevidipine) Injectable Emulsion, a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker indicated for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable for which a clinical trial application (CTA) for China was filed in 2013. We received CTA approval from the China Food and Drug Administration ( CFDA\u201d) in early 2016 and are preparing a clinical study. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization, including pre-and post-launch activities, for both products in the China market (excluding Hong Kong and Macao). We have also agreed to participate in the China registration process for both products. Financial terms of the agreement, in addition to net sales royalties payable to The Medicines Company, include the following additional payments to The Medicines Company: an upfront payment made in the fourth quarter of 2014; a project support services fee; and regulatory/commercial success milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $50.5 million.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Taiwan Liposome Company ( TLC\u201d) which granted us a license and the exclusive rights in China, Hong Kong and Macao to promote, market, distribute and sell ProFlow\u00ae for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD\u201d) and other indications. PAD is a serious cardiovascular condition in which blood flow to the limbs (usually the legs) is restricted due to arterial plaque build-up. Under the terms of the agreement, TLC will be responsible for the continued development including potential clinical trials and regulatory activities, as well as the manufacture and supply of ProFlow, and we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization including pre-and post-launch activities. The agreement provides for the principal terms of the arrangement between SciClone and TLC, and in March 2014, the companies entered into a supplemental collaboration and license agreement. In November 2014, TLC was notified by the CFDA that ProFlow did not receive clinical trial approval and TLC is in the process of appealing the decision.\nIn May 2013, we entered into a framework agreement with Zensun (Shanghai) Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ( Zensun\u201d) for the exclusive promotion, marketing, distribution and sale of NeucardinTM in China, Hong Kong and Macao. Neucardin is a novel,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfirst-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of patients with intermediate to advanced heart failure, for which a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) was submitted to and accepted for review by the CFDA in 2012. In December 2013, the CFDA informed Zensun that its Phase 2 data is insufficient, and has asked Zensun to submit a new NDA once the ongoing Phase 3 study reached its endpoints. As part of our agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million to Zensun, of which $12 million had been loaned as of December 31, 2015 (refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for further information regarding the Zensun loans).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $7.5 million, $11 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in research and development expenses related to our in-license arrangements.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. We were able to mitigate the impact of this price limitation by shifting an equitable portion of the burden of the price reduction to our distributor in our sales channel; accordingly, the impact of the price reduction through the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.8 million. We anticipate that provincial pricing decisions will continue to be a significant factor in the China pharmaceutical market for the foreseeable future. The impact of such decisions on our future results is unpredictable, but we expect that pricing pressures on revenue in 2016 will be offset at least in significant part through sharing of the burden with our China distributor and potentially through volume increases. However, in the future, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm Holding Lingyun Biopharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (Sinopharm), our China distributor for ZADAXIN, which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nAs previously disclosed, since 2010 the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and the US Department of Justice ( DOJ\u201d) had each been conducting formal investigations of us regarding a range of matters, including the possibility of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA\u201d). On February 4, 2016, we announced that we have entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid a total of $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a penalty as final settlement which was released from our restricted escrow account which we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. This payment is in line with the charges we previously recorded and disclosed in our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2015. As part of the agreement we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action (refer to Notes 18 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 and Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 for further information regarding the SEC and DOJ investigations).\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. Our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report losses in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nRevenues:\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our product sales and promotion services revenues (in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct Sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154,329 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>131,973 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>99,414 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPromotion Services\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,928 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,817 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-90%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27,644 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Net Revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>157,257 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>134,790 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>127,058 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales were $154.3 million, $132.0 million, and $99.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase of $22.4 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $126.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $20.0 million, or 16%, which mainly related to a 21% increase in volume sold, offset partially by a 5% decrease in selling price mainly related to a decrease in the list price of ZADAXIN in the Zhejiang province since May 2015. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, also included Pfizer product sales and initial immaterial DC Bead revenue.\nThe increase in product sales of $32.6 million, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $96.3 million for the prior year, an increase of $29.8 million, or 31%, which mainly related to an increase in volume sold, and to a lesser extent related to an increase in selling price. We believe our ZADAXIN product revenues in the first half of fiscal 2013 were adversely affected by the increase in channel inventory we experienced in the third quarter of 2012. We believe channel inventory for ZADAXIN has returned to normalized levels.\nWe anticipate that ZADAXIN revenues in 2016 will be higher than 2015, although our revenues are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and provincial adjustments to tender (retail level, government approved) prices which we cannot predict. The majority of our sales have been in US dollars, although a portion of our sales are denominated in RMB. Per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm through December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm (our sole importer and distributor for ZADAXIN in China) which took effect January 1, 2016, our sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm have been and continue to be denominated in US dollars. However, the established importer price may be adjusted quarterly based upon exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and RMB. Our China ZADAXIN sales revenues are subject to exchange rate risk, and in recent months the RMB has experienced devaluation. In addition, per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which took effect January 1, 2016, our contracted sales prices to Sinopharm are subject to adjustment based on changes in tender prices within the province territories. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. Changes in provincial drug prices for ZADAXIN in the provinces could impact our future sales revenues.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn China, pharmaceutical products are imported and distributed through a tiered method of distribution. For our proprietary product ZADAXIN, we manufacture our product using our US and European contract manufacturers, and we generate our product sales revenue through sales of ZADAXIN product to Sinopharm. Sinopharm acts as an importer, and also as the top tier\u201d of the distribution system ( Tier 1\u201d) in China. Our ZADAXIN sales occur when Sinopharm purchases product from us without any right of return except for replacement of product in the event of damaged product or quality control issues. Passage of title and risk of loss are transferred to Sinopharm at the time of arrival of a shipment at its destination. After the sale, Sinopharm clears products through China import customs, sells directly to large hospitals and holds additional product it has purchased in inventory for sale to the next tier in the distribution system. The second-tier ( Tier 2\u201d) distributors are responsible for the further sale and distribution of the products they purchase from the importer, either through sales of product directly to the retail level (hospitals and pharmacies), or to third-tier ( Tier 3\u201d) local or regional distributors who, in turn, sell products to hospitals and pharmacies.\nPromotion services revenue was $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and related to products promoted under agreements with Baxter and Sanofi Aventis S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d). Promotion services revenue increased $0.1 million or 4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, related to an increase in EndoxanTM (Baxter) product sales. Promotion services revenue decreased $24.8 million or 90% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, related to the expiration of our promotional agreements with Sanofi as of December 31, 2013.\nOur promotion agreements with Sanofi, consisting of individual promotional agreements for certain pharmaceutical products and supplementary agreements extending the terms thereof, were not renewed and expired on December 31, 2013. NovaMed Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. ( NovaMed Shanghai\u201d) and Sanofi negotiated a settlement of certain amounts in dispute, effective as of July 14, 2014, and NovaMed Shanghai received approximately 22 million RMB (approximately $3.5 million) in August 2014 as final payment from Sanofi. The terms of the settlement resulted in the recognition of promotion services revenue, for the second quarter of 2014, of approximately $0.2 million of Sanofi revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013. The remaining approximately $2.6 million of deferred revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013 was reversed with an equivalent write-down of accounts receivable. This contemporaneous write-down of accounts receivable and deferred revenue had no impact on net income for the second quarter of 2014 or for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, with Sanofi were $0, $0.2 million, and $25.0 million, respectively.\nOur Baxter promotion agreement is for a 5-year term, through December 2017. Our Pfizer product distribution agreement is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. In August 2015, we and Cardiome, from whom we licensed Aggrastat\u00ae, mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, and return all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continue to assess the financial performance of the products we promote and distribute under our agreements and their overall value within our entire portfolio of products. Over time, we anticipate the product mix that we promote will change, which may affect our revenues and profitability in the future. If any of these agreements are determined to no longer be beneficial to us and are allowed to expire, or if third parties will not renegotiate, renew or extend the agreements on terms acceptable to us, our revenues would be adversely affected and our profitability may be adversely or beneficially affected. On the other hand, if we are successful in negotiating better terms, there may be a positive impact on our revenues and profitability.\nAll of our promotion services revenue and a majority of our product revenues related to our China segment. Total China revenues were $151.6 million, $130.3 million, and $122.6 million, or 96%, 97% and 97% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Sinopharm and Sanofi in China accounted for approximately 75% and 20% of our revenues, respectively, (prior to the expiration of our promotion agreements with Sanofi).

The decrease in cost of sales of $0.7 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in cost of product sales of Aggrastat as we had recorded a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory during the year ended December 31, 2014 that didn't recur for the year ended December 31, 2015. It was also attributable to our receipt in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $1.1 million for reimbursement for Aggrastat inventory returned that we had previously fully written off in 2014, which was recorded as a reduction in cost of product sales. These decreases in cost of product sales were partially offset by increases in cost of product sales related to ZADAXIN and certain oncology product sales due to increased volume sold. Cost of product sales also increased related to initial DC Bead sales in the second half of 2015.\nThe increase in cost of sales of $5.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was attributable to a $2.0 million increase in ZADAXIN cost of product sales related primarily to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and a $3.3 million increase in Aggrastat and oncology cost of sales as a result of higher sales volume of Aggrastat and certain oncology products. Cost of sales for Aggrastat product also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory expected to expire and $0.2 million associated with Aggrastat inventory shipped within six months of expiration.\nZADAXIN cost of sales were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $17.5 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross margin for ZADAXIN was 87.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 86.1% and 83.9% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in gross margin for ZADAXIN for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due primarily to higher production volume lowering per unit overhead costs and manufacturing efficiencies.\nWe expect our ZADAXIN cost of product sales and gross margins to fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of sales and price of our products, the absorption of product-related fixed costs, currency exchange fluctuations, any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory, and the timing of other inventory period costs such as manufacturing process improvements for the goal of future cost reductions.\nOverall, we expect our gross margin percentages in 2016 to be lower than 2015, based on lower selling prices as set by one province, with indications of others to follow, as well as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange fluctuations.\nSales and Marketing ( S&M\u201d):\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our sales and marketing expenses (in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and Marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,961 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>48,477 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-12%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55,240 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nS&M expenses were $54.0 million, $48.5 million, and $55.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The amounts provided were paid in 2014.\nSEC Settlement Expense:\nWe recorded a charge of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the possibility of a settlement with the SEC and DOJ regarding their investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by us, and we recorded additional charges totaling $10.8 million associated with the SEC settlement in 2015. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty as final settlement. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any actions. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Note 18 Contingencies\u201d and Note 22 Subsequent Events\u201d for further information on this matter.\nOther Income:\nOn July 8, 2013, we and the representatives of the former stockholders of NovaMed entered into a Confidential Escrow Settlement Agreement\u201d pursuant to which we retained approximately $0.8 million in cash and 342,300 shares of our common stock, having a combined fair value of approximately $2.6 million on the settlement date. As a result, we recorded $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to other income related to this settlement.\nProvision for Income Tax:\nThe provision for income tax relates to our foreign operations in China. The provision for income tax was $0.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tax expense decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, mainly related to a reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) in China due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations.\nThe tax provision decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, principally due to a reduction of approximately $0.2 million in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations. Tax expense was also lower for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of lower taxable income related to our China operations.\nThe statutory tax rate in China was 25% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect the provision for income tax to increase for the year ending December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in our China operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards for US federal income tax purposes of approximately $114.2 million that expire in the years 2020 through 2035, and had approximately $52 million in net operating loss carryforwards related to our NovaMed Shanghai subsidiary that expire in the years 2016-2020. As of December 31, 2015, we had US federal research and development, orphan drug and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.2 million that expire in the years 2018 through 2035.\nBecause of the change in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. We rely on our operating cash flows, and cash and cash equivalents to provide for our liquidity requirements. We believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months to fund our working capital requirements of our operations, including investments in our business, and to fund our business development activities.\nThe following tables summarize our cash and investments and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the years presented (in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and investments\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>101,403 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>86,303 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $101.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, in addition to the $12.8 million of restricted cash held in escrow for the SEC settlement, of which $98.5 million was located in subsidiaries of the Company outside the US. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the US are held primarily in US dollars. Such cash and cash equivalents are used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations, which may include in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and for potential acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we repatriated $12.8 million in funds via a special dividend distribution from our foreign subsidiary as a result of the need to fund an escrow facility for our SEC settlement (as previously described). This dividend distribution was made from the current year earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary, which was not part of the cumulative pool of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014.\nWe have determined that as of December 31, 2015, $176.2 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, after the payment of the dividend which was satisfied entirely out of current year earnings and profits, continues to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the US. In making this determination, the following attributes were considered: (i) the expected future needs of the foreign subsidiaries, including working capital, capital expenditures, as well as additional investments to support the infrastructure in our China subsidiaries and (ii) additional investments to support our expansion in the China market as well as planned product licensing transactions. Upon distribution of our foreign undistributed earnings, we may be subject to US federal and state income taxes. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2015, but we do anticipate a need to repatriate a portion of future foreign earnings to fund our US operations. We will accrue for US income taxes on future foreign earnings that we anticipate repatriating from our foreign subsidiaries.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,507 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,609 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,502 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(9,010) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(6,203) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,419) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(20,806) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,353) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We reserved an amount of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a bad debt charge recorded in general and administrative expense related to a customer whose receivable balance was past due which we subsequently wrote off when we determined it to be uncollectible during the fourth quarter of 2015. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year's period, mainly related to the additional $10.8 million SEC settlement expense recorded to operating expense related to the settlement with the SEC. Restricted cash in escrow for the SEC settlement increased $12.8 million related to the $12.8 million SEC settlement amount deposited in escrow during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for expiring inventory, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, we had accounts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreceivable totaling approximately $0.9 million from a single customer, which were substantially delinquent and which we were actively trying to collect, and for which we had recorded a reserve of $0.9 million. We entered into a settlement agreement with the customer in October 2014 to collect the remaining balance (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8). Accounts receivable increased $3.3 million mainly related to an increase in ZADAXIN sales. Inventory decreased $5.9 million mainly related to ZADAXIN inventory sales during the first half of 2014 exceeding our purchase levels, excluding approximately $2.9 million in Pfizer and Aggrastat inventory not yet paid for as of December 31, 2014. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $5.9 million mainly related to sales and marketing and manufacturing expense payments made during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash escrow share settlement, loss on maturity of available-for-sale investments, provision for losses on accounts receivable, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $4.0 million related to an increase in our ZADAXIN sales during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to the same quarter of 2012 when there was excess inventory of ZADAXIN in the channel. Inventory increased $4.7 million due to the completion our new manufacturing process and processing of new batches.\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($9.0) million, ($6.2) million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, purchases of property and equipment were $1.8 million, $1.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, we received proceeds of $0.1 million and $0.4 million from the sale or maturity of our short-term investments or available-for-sale securities, net of purchases. In addition, as part of our license and supply agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million in total to Zensun under two separate loan agreements. Pursuant to these agreements, we loaned $7.25 million in the first half of 2015, and $4.75 million to Zensun during the second half of 2014 (such lendings are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8), which is reflected in the $9.0 million and $6.2 million of net cash used in investing activities for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes by Zensun. To secure the loans, Zensun pledged its entire equity interest in its subsidiary, Shanghai Dongxin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (whose assets include real property) to SciClone Pharmaceuticals International China Holding Ltd ( SPIL China\u201d).\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8.4 million, $20.8 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we used $12.8 million, $24.4 million, and $12.5 million, respectively, to repurchase and retire approximately 1.5 million, 3.8 million, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we also received $4.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.7 million of proceeds, respectively, from the issuances of common stock made under our stock award plans. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our subsidiary borrowed $0.6 million and repaid $2.0 million under its loan agreement with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd that expired August 29, 2013. All amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date. Restricted cash of $2.3 million was released during the year ended December 31, 2013, that had been used to secure a letter of credit related to a loan agreement.\nIn December 2013, our subsidiary, NovaMed Shanghai, entered into a 10.0 million RMB revolving line of credit facility (approximately $1.6 million USD) and a maximum 15.0 million RMB loan facility (approximately $2.4 million USD) secured by its accounts receivable with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd. (the Credit Facility\u201d). In June 2014, NovaMed Shanghai repaid the 10.0 million RMB (approximately $1.6 million USD) under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility expired on November 30, 2014 and all amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following summarizes our other future contractual obligations as of

</tr>\n</table>\nUnder our $80.5 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1,526,306 shares at a cost of $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 bringing the total repurchases since the program's inception to approximately 13.2 million shares at a cost of $78.1 million through December 31, 2015. Our stock repurchase program expired December 31, 2015 and is currently under strategic review by the Board.\nWe recorded a charge of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the possibility of a settlement with the SEC and DOJ regarding their investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by us. Based on our discussions with the SEC, we recorded an additional $10.8 million in SEC settlement to operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, bringing the total loss to the government in penalties, fines and/or other remedies to $12.8 million. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the agreement, in February 2016, we paid $12.8 million including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty from our restricted escrow account that we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Notes 18 and 22 for further information on this matter.\nUnder our license agreements with third parties we have agreed to various milestone payments related to regulatory and commercial success and other achievements that may require substantial payments in the future.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. We have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to a registration statement. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies, product candidates or marketing territories. Additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or on favorable terms.\nWe intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations, in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and potential acquisitions, as may be required. In addition, as previously disclosed, our Board is evaluating a range of strategic transactions with a view to enhancing stockholder value. The unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long-term product development and commercialization programs, either of which could hurt our business. We cannot assure you that funds from financings, if any, will be sufficient to in-license additional products. The need, timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors, including the status of the pending regulatory investigations and pending litigations, the level and price of our products, the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to our products, the availability of complementary products, technologies and businesses, the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing, the timing of regulatory approvals, developments in relationships with existing or future\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncollaborative parties, the status of competitive products, and various alternatives for financing. We have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-sheet balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nGeneral\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue. We recognize product revenue from selling manufactured ZADAXIN product at the time of delivery. Sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm are recognized upon the arrival of a shipment to its destination when title and risk of loss to the product are transferred to them. We also earn product revenue from purchasing medical products from pharmaceutical companies and selling them directly to importers or distributors. We recognize revenue related to these products based on the sell-in\u201d method, when the medical products have been delivered to the importers or distributors. Payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors.\nPromotion Services Revenue. We recognize promotion services revenue after designated medical products are delivered to the distributors as specified in the promotion services contracts, which marks the period when marketing and promotion services have been rendered, and the revenue recognition criteria are met. In certain arrangements, we were required to return or refund a portion of promotion services fees received during interim periods from pharmaceutical customers if defined annual sales targets were not achieved. Under our agreements with these customers, if the agreement was terminated, and provided such targets had been met on a pro rata\u201d basis at the date of contract termination, we were entitled to retain the amounts paid. Due to these contractual provisions, we recognized revenue during interim periods without reduction for amounts subject to refund based on Method 2 of Accounting Standards Codification 605-20-S99-1, Accounting for Management Fees Based on a Formula.\u201d\nRevenue Reserve. We maintain a revenue reserve for product returns based on estimates of the amount of product to be returned by our customers which is based on historical patterns, analysis of market demand and/or a percentage of sales based on industry trends, and management's evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns. Importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality. However, we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. The calculation of the product returns reserve requires estimates and involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. As a result of the uncertainties involved in estimating the product returns reserve, there is a possibility that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenue reserves were approximately $0.1 million; the reserves were recorded as accrued liabilities on our consolidated balances sheets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe evaluate our returns reserve quarterly and adjust it when events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate. Changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations or financial position. It is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods.\nAccounts Receivable Reserve\nWe record a receivable reserve based on a specific review of our overdue invoices. Our estimate for a reserve is determined after considering our existing contractual payment terms, payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, the age of any outstanding receivables and our current customer relationships. Accounts receivable are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had a receivable reserve of $0.6 million. In October 2014, our subsidiary, SPIL China, executed an agreement with a particular customer providing for settlement of a $3.0 million receivable balance. The terms of the settlement agreement resulted in the write-off of $1.1 million in previously fully reserved accounts receivable with an equivalent charge-off of the allowance for bad debt, which had no impact on net income in 2014, as the subsequent agreement provided direct evidence that the $1.1 million previously reserved will not be collected in the future. Of the remaining $1.9 million receivable balance, $0.4 million and $1.0 million were collected in 2015 and 2014, respectively, per the terms of the settlement agreement, and these gains on recovery were recorded as reductions to general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, a balance of $0.5 million remained uncollected from the same customer but remained fully reserved. We recognized $0.5 million of bad debt expense in general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2015 related to past due receivables from another customer, due to uncertainty regarding the collectability of the customer's outstanding receivable balance. We wrote-off the $0.5 million of past due accounts receivable from this customer during the fourth quarter of 2015 as uncollectible.\nInventories\nOur inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and include amounts related to materials, labor and overhead. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels. If our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required, which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations. If obsolete or excess items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory, we will record a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded inventory write-downs of $0, $2.1 million, $0, respectively, principally related to carrying value reductions for excess Aggrastat product. As we have discontinued this product, remaining inventory is zero at December 31, 2015.\nGoodwill\nWe account for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 805, and ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. ASC Topic 805 requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies the criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets in accordance with ASC Topic 350. Judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators will be based on operating results, changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy, and market and economic trends.\nGoodwill relates to our China segment which focuses on our primary pharmaceutical distribution market, consisting of the NovaMed business and the legacy China business of the Company, which represent a single reporting unit. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we tested for goodwill impairment by quantitatively comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amounts - step one of the two-step impairment test. We estimated the fair value of the China reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. This valuation approach considers a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, and requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of our business. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to impairment charges in the future. Our methodology for determining fair value remained consistent for the periods presented. If we determine that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would then calculate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as compared to its carrying value to determine the appropriate impairment charge. After completing our annual impairment review for the reporting unit as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and our interim impairment review during the third quarter of 2013, as a result of the notification by Sanofi of the non-renewal of our promotional agreements with them at the end of their terms on December 31, 2013, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired in 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable consist of two loans to one third party (see Note 6). Loans are initially recorded, and continue to be carried, at unpaid principal balances under other assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Carried balances are subsequently adjusted for payments of principal or adjustments to the allowance for loan losses to account for any impairment. Interest income is recognized over the term of the loans and is calculated using the simple-interest method, as the loans do not have associated premium or discount. If the loans were to experience impairment, interest income would not be recognized unless the likelihood of further loss was remote.\nManagement considers impairment to exist when, based on current information or factors (such as payment history, value of collateral, and assessment of the counterparty's current creditworthiness), it is probable that principal and interest payments will not be collected according to the contractual agreements. Management considers a loan payment delinquent when not received by the due date.\nManagement assessed the credit worthiness of the counterparty by reviewing available borrower financial information and substantiation of the value of the pledged security interest in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements. Management also considered in its analysis that the borrower was compliant with the terms of the loans, that interest payments have been timely made, and that available reliable evidence indicated that the market value of the pledged security was greater than the loan receivable balance. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, management concluded the loans receivable were not impaired, and there was no allowance for loan losses.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe record as liabilities estimated amounts for litigation, claims or other legal actions that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations, regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation, which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain. We disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes. As events occur, we will assess the potential liability related to any pending litigation, claims or other legal actions and adjust our estimates accordingly.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record stock-based compensation costs relating to share-based payment transactions, including stock options, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance restricted stock units ( PSUs\u201d) and employee stock purchase plans ( ESPP\u201d). Stock-based compensation expense for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is estimated at the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense values for stock options, RSUs and the ESPP plan are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize expense related to the performance stock options and PSUs over the implicit service period if it is probable that the performance goals will be achieved. If it is subsequently determined that the performance goals are not probable of achievement, the expense related to the performance stock options or PSUs is reversed. The share-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest are recognized as expense ratably (as the awards vest) over the requisite service period, which is generally one or four years for stock options and RSUs and three months for ESPP. We estimate pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest.\nThe option-pricing models require the use of certain subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and the expected term of the award. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nExpected term is derived from historical data on employee exercises and terminations. We review our valuation assumptions at each grant date, and, as a result, valuation assumptions used to value stock-based compensation of awards granted in future periods may change.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. The tax years 1995-2015 remain open to examination by the major US taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The Internal Revenue Service completed their examinations of our 2008, 2009 and 2011 US Federal tax returns with no additional tax assessments or proposed adjustments relating to taxable income for any years. Our China income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of five years and those years remain open to examination.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.\nRestructuring Costs\nWhen necessary, we record expense for the estimated costs of restructuring activities. The liability recorded for restructuring costs contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amounts and timing of future settlement payments and the timing of such payments. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors including the number of employees involved and the related benefits included in the restructuring plan, and historical settlement experience. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our restructuring liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains which would have an impact on the results of operations for that period.\nNew Accounting Standards Updates\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which contains new accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, which reflects a one year deferral approved by the FASB in July 2015, with early application permitted provided that the effective date is not earlier than the original effective date. We are in the process of determining what impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. The standard permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\" ( ASU 2015-11\u201d) which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\"). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and have concluded we will likely have no effect on the financial statements as our adjustments already reflect the concept of net realizable value. Inventory provisions are generally full write-downs for the affected inventory.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \"Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\" This ASU amends existing guidance to require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance which required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. Additionally, the new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We have not yet selected an adoption method. The impact of adopting this guidance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements given our deferred tax amounts.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases\u201d. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_tables": "Table 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCLN) is a United States ( US\u201d)-headquartered, China-focused, specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders. We are focused on continuing to grow our revenue and profitability. Our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the People's Republic of China ( China\u201d or PRC\u201d) where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through many years of experience marketing our lead product, ZADAXIN\u00ae (thymalfasin). In addition, we have an established product promotion business model with large pharmaceutical partners and we are focused on establishing profitability in all of these collaborations. We believe our sales and marketing strengths position us to benefit from the long-term expansion of the pharmaceutical market in China. The Chinese pharmaceutical market currently ranks second among the global pharmaceutical markets, and had an estimated worth of $105 billion in 2014. It is forecasted to increase significantly to $200 billion by 2020. We seek to expand our presence in China and increase revenues by growing sales and profits of our current product portfolio, launching new products from our development pipeline, adding new, profitable product services agreements and leveraging our strong cash position to in-license additional products.\nWe operate in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers: 1) China and 2) the Rest of the World, which includes our US and Hong Kong operations.\nWe have two categories of revenues: product sales revenues\u201d and promotion services revenues.\u201d Our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in-licensed products, including our lead product, ZADAXIN; DC Bead\u00ae, a product for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors, for which we initiated sales and recorded product revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2015, and products from Pfizer International Trading (Shanghai) Ltd. ( Pfizer\u201d). Through June 30, 2015, our product sales revenues also included Aggrastat\u00ae, an intervention cardiology product launched in China in 2009, in-licensed from Cardiome Pharma Corp ( Cardiome\u201d). In August 2015, we and Cardiome mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, thereby terminating our exclusive distribution rights in China, and returning all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nZADAXIN has the highest margins in our portfolio as it is a premium product sold exclusively by SciClone. In addition, we anticipate that new marketed products, when and if introduced, can increase the future revenues and profitability of our pharmaceutical business in China over the coming years. Our promotion services revenues\u201d result primarily from fees we receive for exclusively promoting products in China for Baxter International, Inc. ( Baxter\u201d). We recognize promotion services revenues as a percentage of our collaborators' product sales revenue for these exclusively promoted products. Over time, as additional proprietary or in-licensed products come to the market, we aim to shift our product mix towards those products providing higher margins for us.\nZADAXIN is approved in over 30 countries and may be used for the treatment of HBV, HCV, and certain cancers, and as an immune system enhancer according to the local regulatory approvals we have in these countries. In China, thymalfasin is included in the treatment guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health ( MOH\u201d) for liver cancer, as well as guidelines for treatment of chronic HBV (issued by both the Chinese Medical Association and the Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver) and invasive fungal infections of critically ill patients (issued by the Chinese Medical Association). Our sales force is focused on increasing sales to the country's largest hospitals (class 3A with over 500 beds) as well as mid-size hospitals (class 2A). These hospitals serve Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities located mostly in the eastern part of China, which are the largest and generally have the most affluent populations. We are widening our market strategies by piloting e-commerce approaches to reach customers. We are also seeking to expand the indications for which ZADAXIN could be used, including sepsis.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe initiated sales and recorded our first product revenue from DC Bead in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The China Food and Drug Administration had approved the registration of DC Bead for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors in August 2014. DC Bead may be used to treat liver cancer, a large and growing indication in China, and we believe our oncology sales team and academic marketing liaisons have established high quality relationships with medical professionals and institutions that specialize in cancer treatment, which we believe will be a valuable asset as we continue commercial sales of DC Bead. BioCompatibles UK Ltd. ( BTG\u201d) and SciClone previously entered into an agreement granting SciClone exclusive licensing and distribution rights to DC Bead in China. Under the agreement, we are purchasing DC Bead product from BTG.\nWe are also pursuing the registration of several other therapeutic products in China. These include: Loramyc\u00ae, a mucoadhesive tablet formulation of miconazole lauriad to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis; and RapidFilm\u00ae, an oral film formulation of ondansetron to treat nausea induced by chemotherapy.\nOur agreement with Baxter is for a 5-year term, through December 2017, and our agreement with Pfizer is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. We are pursuing additional agreements to generate additional revenue. We continue to seek in-licensing arrangements for well-differentiated products at various stages of development that, if not yet approved, have a defined regulatory approval pathway in China. Our objective is to in-license products that provide us with higher margins, augmenting our product sales revenue and profitability, and we continue to explore opportunities to optimize our promotion services revenues.\nIn May 2015, Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ( Theravance Biopharma\u201d) granted SciClone exclusive development and commercialization rights to VIBATIV\u00ae (telavancin) in China, as well as the Hong Kong SAR, the Macau SAR, Taiwan and Vietnam, in exchange for upfront and regulatory milestone payments totaling $6 million. SciClone will be responsible for all aspects of development and commercialization in the partnered regions, including pre- and post-launch activities and product registration. SciClone will initially develop VIBATIV for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, and additional indications may include complicated skin and skin structure infections and potentially bacteremia. Theravance Biopharma will sell to SciClone all clinical and commercial product required to develop and commercialize VIBATIV in China and our other licensed territories.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with The Medicines Company for two cardiovascular products in China. The partnership includes an agreement granting us a license and the exclusive rights in China to promote two products including 1) Angiomax\u00ae (bivalirudin) for Injection, an anticoagulant indicated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) and in patients with, or at risk of, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome undergoing PCI for which a Phase 3 registration trial was completed in China and is currently under review by the China Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval, and 2) Cleviprex\u00ae (clevidipine) Injectable Emulsion, a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker indicated for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable for which a clinical trial application (CTA) for China was filed in 2013. We received CTA approval from the China Food and Drug Administration ( CFDA\u201d) in early 2016 and are preparing a clinical study. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization, including pre-and post-launch activities, for both products in the China market (excluding Hong Kong and Macao). We have also agreed to participate in the China registration process for both products. Financial terms of the agreement, in addition to net sales royalties payable to The Medicines Company, include the following additional payments to The Medicines Company: an upfront payment made in the fourth quarter of 2014; a project support services fee; and regulatory/commercial success milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $50.5 million.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Taiwan Liposome Company ( TLC\u201d) which granted us a license and the exclusive rights in China, Hong Kong and Macao to promote, market, distribute and sell ProFlow\u00ae for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD\u201d) and other indications. PAD is a serious cardiovascular condition in which blood flow to the limbs (usually the legs) is restricted due to arterial plaque build-up. Under the terms of the agreement, TLC will be responsible for the continued development including potential clinical trials and regulatory activities, as well as the manufacture and supply of ProFlow, and we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization including pre-and post-launch activities. The agreement provides for the principal terms of the arrangement between SciClone and TLC, and in March 2014, the companies entered into a supplemental collaboration and license agreement. In November 2014, TLC was notified by the CFDA that ProFlow did not receive clinical trial approval and TLC is in the process of appealing the decision.\nIn May 2013, we entered into a framework agreement with Zensun (Shanghai) Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ( Zensun\u201d) for the exclusive promotion, marketing, distribution and sale of NeucardinTM in China, Hong Kong and Macao. Neucardin is a novel,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfirst-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of patients with intermediate to advanced heart failure, for which a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) was submitted to and accepted for review by the CFDA in 2012. In December 2013, the CFDA informed Zensun that its Phase 2 data is insufficient, and has asked Zensun to submit a new NDA once the ongoing Phase 3 study reached its endpoints. As part of our agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million to Zensun, of which $12 million had been loaned as of December 31, 2015 (refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for further information regarding the Zensun loans).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $7.5 million, $11 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in research and development expenses related to our in-license arrangements.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. We were able to mitigate the impact of this price limitation by shifting an equitable portion of the burden of the price reduction to our distributor in our sales channel; accordingly, the impact of the price reduction through the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.8 million. We anticipate that provincial pricing decisions will continue to be a significant factor in the China pharmaceutical market for the foreseeable future. The impact of such decisions on our future results is unpredictable, but we expect that pricing pressures on revenue in 2016 will be offset at least in significant part through sharing of the burden with our China distributor and potentially through volume increases. However, in the future, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm Holding Lingyun Biopharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (Sinopharm), our China distributor for ZADAXIN, which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nAs previously disclosed, since 2010 the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and the US Department of Justice ( DOJ\u201d) had each been conducting formal investigations of us regarding a range of matters, including the possibility of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA\u201d). On February 4, 2016, we announced that we have entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid a total of $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a penalty as final settlement which was released from our restricted escrow account which we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. This payment is in line with the charges we previously recorded and disclosed in our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2015. As part of the agreement we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action (refer to Notes 18 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 and Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 for further information regarding the SEC and DOJ investigations).\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. Our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report losses in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nRevenues:\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our product sales and promotion services revenues (in thousands):\n\nProduct sales were $154.3 million, $132.0 million, and $99.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase of $22.4 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $126.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $20.0 million, or 16%, which mainly related to a 21% increase in volume sold, offset partially by a 5% decrease in selling price mainly related to a decrease in the list price of ZADAXIN in the Zhejiang province since May 2015. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, also included Pfizer product sales and initial immaterial DC Bead revenue.\nThe increase in product sales of $32.6 million, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $96.3 million for the prior year, an increase of $29.8 million, or 31%, which mainly related to an increase in volume sold, and to a lesser extent related to an increase in selling price. We believe our ZADAXIN product revenues in the first half of fiscal 2013 were adversely affected by the increase in channel inventory we experienced in the third quarter of 2012. We believe channel inventory for ZADAXIN has returned to normalized levels.\nWe anticipate that ZADAXIN revenues in 2016 will be higher than 2015, although our revenues are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and provincial adjustments to tender (retail level, government approved) prices which we cannot predict. The majority of our sales have been in US dollars, although a portion of our sales are denominated in RMB. Per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm through December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm (our sole importer and distributor for ZADAXIN in China) which took effect January 1, 2016, our sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm have been and continue to be denominated in US dollars. However, the established importer price may be adjusted quarterly based upon exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and RMB. Our China ZADAXIN sales revenues are subject to exchange rate risk, and in recent months the RMB has experienced devaluation. In addition, per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which took effect January 1, 2016, our contracted sales prices to Sinopharm are subject to adjustment based on changes in tender prices within the province territories. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. Changes in provincial drug prices for ZADAXIN in the provinces could impact our future sales revenues.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn China, pharmaceutical products are imported and distributed through a tiered method of distribution. For our proprietary product ZADAXIN, we manufacture our product using our US and European contract manufacturers, and we generate our product sales revenue through sales of ZADAXIN product to Sinopharm. Sinopharm acts as an importer, and also as the top tier\u201d of the distribution system ( Tier 1\u201d) in China. Our ZADAXIN sales occur when Sinopharm purchases product from us without any right of return except for replacement of product in the event of damaged product or quality control issues. Passage of title and risk of loss are transferred to Sinopharm at the time of arrival of a shipment at its destination. After the sale, Sinopharm clears products through China import customs, sells directly to large hospitals and holds additional product it has purchased in inventory for sale to the next tier in the distribution system. The second-tier ( Tier 2\u201d) distributors are responsible for the further sale and distribution of the products they purchase from the importer, either through sales of product directly to the retail level (hospitals and pharmacies), or to third-tier ( Tier 3\u201d) local or regional distributors who, in turn, sell products to hospitals and pharmacies.\nPromotion services revenue was $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and related to products promoted under agreements with Baxter and Sanofi Aventis S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d). Promotion services revenue increased $0.1 million or 4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, related to an increase in EndoxanTM (Baxter) product sales. Promotion services revenue decreased $24.8 million or 90% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, related to the expiration of our promotional agreements with Sanofi as of December 31, 2013.\nOur promotion agreements with Sanofi, consisting of individual promotional agreements for certain pharmaceutical products and supplementary agreements extending the terms thereof, were not renewed and expired on December 31, 2013. NovaMed Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. ( NovaMed Shanghai\u201d) and Sanofi negotiated a settlement of certain amounts in dispute, effective as of July 14, 2014, and NovaMed Shanghai received approximately 22 million RMB (approximately $3.5 million) in August 2014 as final payment from Sanofi. The terms of the settlement resulted in the recognition of promotion services revenue, for the second quarter of 2014, of approximately $0.2 million of Sanofi revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013. The remaining approximately $2.6 million of deferred revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013 was reversed with an equivalent write-down of accounts receivable. This contemporaneous write-down of accounts receivable and deferred revenue had no impact on net income for the second quarter of 2014 or for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, with Sanofi were $0, $0.2 million, and $25.0 million, respectively.\nOur Baxter promotion agreement is for a 5-year term, through December 2017. Our Pfizer product distribution agreement is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. In August 2015, we and Cardiome, from whom we licensed Aggrastat\u00ae, mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, and return all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continue to assess the financial performance of the products we promote and distribute under our agreements and their overall value within our entire portfolio of products. Over time, we anticipate the product mix that we promote will change, which may affect our revenues and profitability in the future. If any of these agreements are determined to no longer be beneficial to us and are allowed to expire, or if third parties will not renegotiate, renew or extend the agreements on terms acceptable to us, our revenues would be adversely affected and our profitability may be adversely or beneficially affected. On the other hand, if we are successful in negotiating better terms, there may be a positive impact on our revenues and profitability.\nAll of our promotion services revenue and a majority of our product revenues related to our China segment. Total China revenues were $151.6 million, $130.3 million, and $122.6 million, or 96%, 97% and 97% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Rest of the World segment revenues were $5.7 million, $4.5 million, and $4.4 million, or 4%, 3%, and 3%, for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and related to sales of ZADAXIN product.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales to Sinopharm in China accounted for approximately 97% and 94% of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Sinopharm and Sanofi in China accounted for approximately 75% and 20% of our revenues, respectively, (prior to the expiration of our promotion agreements with Sanofi). Our experience with our largest customer has been good and we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our product to them.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCost of Product Sales:\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our cost of product sales (in thousands):\n\nCost of product sales was $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.7 million. The decrease in cost of sales of $0.7 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in cost of product sales of Aggrastat as we had recorded a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory during the year ended December 31, 2014 that didn't recur for the year ended December 31, 2015. It was also attributable to our receipt in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $1.1 million for reimbursement for Aggrastat inventory returned that we had previously fully written off in 2014, which was recorded as a reduction in cost of product sales. These decreases in cost of product sales were partially offset by increases in cost of product sales related to ZADAXIN and certain oncology product sales due to increased volume sold. Cost of product sales also increased related to initial DC Bead sales in the second half of 2015.\nThe increase in cost of sales of $5.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was attributable to a $2.0 million increase in ZADAXIN cost of product sales related primarily to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and a $3.3 million increase in Aggrastat and oncology cost of sales as a result of higher sales volume of Aggrastat and certain oncology products. Cost of sales for Aggrastat product also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory expected to expire and $0.2 million associated with Aggrastat inventory shipped within six months of expiration.\nZADAXIN cost of sales were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $17.5 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross margin for ZADAXIN was 87.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 86.1% and 83.9% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in gross margin for ZADAXIN for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due primarily to higher production volume lowering per unit overhead costs and manufacturing efficiencies.\nWe expect our ZADAXIN cost of product sales and gross margins to fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of sales and price of our products, the absorption of product-related fixed costs, currency exchange fluctuations, any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory, and the timing of other inventory period costs such as manufacturing process improvements for the goal of future cost reductions.\nOverall, we expect our gross margin percentages in 2016 to be lower than 2015, based on lower selling prices as set by one province, with indications of others to follow, as well as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange fluctuations.\nSales and Marketing ( S&M\u201d):\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our sales and marketing expenses (in thousands):\n\nS&M expenses were $54.0 million, $48.5 million, and $55.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. S&M expenses increased by $5.5 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, related to growth in our S&M efforts for ZADAXIN and DC Bead. S&M expenses decreased by $6.8 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, related to the expiration of the Sanofi distribution agreements and the reduction in costs associated with marketing the products under the Sanofi agreements. The reductions in S&M expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, were partially offset by increases in our S&M efforts for ZADAXIN in 2014.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe anticipate total S&M expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016 to be higher than those incurred for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to growth in our S&M efforts for ZADAXIN.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d):\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our R&D expenses (in thousands):\n\nR&D expenses were $12.3 million, $14.6 million, and $8.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $7.5 million, $11.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in R&D expenses related to upfront and milestone costs under our in-license arrangements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, R&D expenditures included R&D expenditures related to in-licensing agreements with certain business partners and R&D activities in China. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, R&D expenses also included costs incurred related to preparation for a potential sepsis clinical study for ZADAXIN we were contemplating which has not been continued.\nThe major components of R&D expenses include salaries and other personnel-related expenses, including associated stock-based compensation, facility-related expenses, depreciation of facilities and equipment, license-related fees, services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers.\nWe anticipate our R&D expenses to increase in 2016 compared to 2015 related to potential license fee payments, milestone payments expected to occur under license arrangements, and related to research and development activities in China.\nGeneral and Administrative ( G&A\u201d):\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our G&A expenses (in thousands):\n\nG&A expenses were $27.9 million, $22.7 million, and $32.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $5.2 million, or 23%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 mainly related to a China legal-entity restructuring plan which we are in the process of implementing, higher professional consulting fees for business development strategy, higher stock-based compensation expense, and lower credits to bad debt expense for recovery of previously written off accounts receivable, offset by lower legal expenses related to our investigations with the SEC and DOJ and lower accounting fees.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $9.8 million, or 30%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, mainly related to a decrease in legal fees associated with the government investigations, MEDA Pharma GmbH & Co KG ( MEDA\u201d) arbitration and other corporate matters. During the year ended December 31, 2014, G&A expenses also reflected credits to bad debt expense for $1.5 million in recovery of previously fully reserved substantially delinquent accounts receivable balances from a particular customer that had been fully reserved prior to 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an additional $2.4 million in bad debt expense related to significantly past due accounts receivable from the customer noted above in order to fully reserve such receivables. The increase in bad debt expense was determined as a result of continual negotiations that indicated the accounts receivable balance may not be recoverable. Additional increases in G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013, included higher professional expenses of approximately $5.3 million related to legal matters associated with the government investigations and our ongoing improvements to our FCPA compliance efforts, and approximately $1.1 million mainly related to accounting matters associated with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and certain quarters of 2012 and 2011 and matters involving consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to one aspect of our accounting for one of our contracts, as well as higher general and administrative personnel-related costs and higher legal costs related to other general corporate matters.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe expect our G&A expenses in 2016 to increase compared to 2015 related to growth in our business. As previously disclosed in our Form 8-K issued in early February 2016, our Board is evaluating a range of strategic transactions with a view to enhancing shareholder value. We may incur certain G&A expenses in connection with this evaluation.\nRestructuring Charges:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $1.2 million to restructuring charges to reflect planned reductions in our China segment related to our sales force and the one-time termination benefits for approximately 175 employees as a result of the non-renewal of the Sanofi promotion agreement as of December 31, 2013. The amounts provided were paid in 2014.\nSEC Settlement Expense:\nWe recorded a charge of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the possibility of a settlement with the SEC and DOJ regarding their investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by us, and we recorded additional charges totaling $10.8 million associated with the SEC settlement in 2015. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty as final settlement. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any actions. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Note 18 Contingencies\u201d and Note 22 Subsequent Events\u201d for further information on this matter.\nOther Income:\nOn July 8, 2013, we and the representatives of the former stockholders of NovaMed entered into a Confidential Escrow Settlement Agreement\u201d pursuant to which we retained approximately $0.8 million in cash and 342,300 shares of our common stock, having a combined fair value of approximately $2.6 million on the settlement date. As a result, we recorded $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to other income related to this settlement.\nProvision for Income Tax:\nThe provision for income tax relates to our foreign operations in China. The provision for income tax was $0.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tax expense decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, mainly related to a reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) in China due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations.\nThe tax provision decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, principally due to a reduction of approximately $0.2 million in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations. Tax expense was also lower for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of lower taxable income related to our China operations.\nThe statutory tax rate in China was 25% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect the provision for income tax to increase for the year ending December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in our China operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards for US federal income tax purposes of approximately $114.2 million that expire in the years 2020 through 2035, and had approximately $52 million in net operating loss carryforwards related to our NovaMed Shanghai subsidiary that expire in the years 2016-2020. As of December 31, 2015, we had US federal research and development, orphan drug and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.2 million that expire in the years 2018 through 2035.\nBecause of the change in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. We rely on our operating cash flows, and cash and cash equivalents to provide for our liquidity requirements. We believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months to fund our working capital requirements of our operations, including investments in our business, and to fund our business development activities.\nThe following tables summarize our cash and investments and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the years presented (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $101.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, in addition to the $12.8 million of restricted cash held in escrow for the SEC settlement, of which $98.5 million was located in subsidiaries of the Company outside the US. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the US are held primarily in US dollars. Such cash and cash equivalents are used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations, which may include in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and for potential acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we repatriated $12.8 million in funds via a special dividend distribution from our foreign subsidiary as a result of the need to fund an escrow facility for our SEC settlement (as previously described). This dividend distribution was made from the current year earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary, which was not part of the cumulative pool of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014.\nWe have determined that as of December 31, 2015, $176.2 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, after the payment of the dividend which was satisfied entirely out of current year earnings and profits, continues to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the US. In making this determination, the following attributes were considered: (i) the expected future needs of the foreign subsidiaries, including working capital, capital expenditures, as well as additional investments to support the infrastructure in our China subsidiaries and (ii) additional investments to support our expansion in the China market as well as planned product licensing transactions. Upon distribution of our foreign undistributed earnings, we may be subject to US federal and state income taxes. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2015, but we do anticipate a need to repatriate a portion of future foreign earnings to fund our US operations. We will accrue for US income taxes on future foreign earnings that we anticipate repatriating from our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We reserved an amount of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a bad debt charge recorded in general and administrative expense related to a customer whose receivable balance was past due which we subsequently wrote off when we determined it to be uncollectible during the fourth quarter of 2015. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year's period, mainly related to the additional $10.8 million SEC settlement expense recorded to operating expense related to the settlement with the SEC. Restricted cash in escrow for the SEC settlement increased $12.8 million related to the $12.8 million SEC settlement amount deposited in escrow during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for expiring inventory, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, we had accounts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreceivable totaling approximately $0.9 million from a single customer, which were substantially delinquent and which we were actively trying to collect, and for which we had recorded a reserve of $0.9 million. We entered into a settlement agreement with the customer in October 2014 to collect the remaining balance (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8). Accounts receivable increased $3.3 million mainly related to an increase in ZADAXIN sales. Inventory decreased $5.9 million mainly related to ZADAXIN inventory sales during the first half of 2014 exceeding our purchase levels, excluding approximately $2.9 million in Pfizer and Aggrastat inventory not yet paid for as of December 31, 2014. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $5.9 million mainly related to sales and marketing and manufacturing expense payments made during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash escrow share settlement, loss on maturity of available-for-sale investments, provision for losses on accounts receivable, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $4.0 million related to an increase in our ZADAXIN sales during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to the same quarter of 2012 when there was excess inventory of ZADAXIN in the channel. Inventory increased $4.7 million due to the completion our new manufacturing process and processing of new batches.\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($9.0) million, ($6.2) million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, purchases of property and equipment were $1.8 million, $1.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, we received proceeds of $0.1 million and $0.4 million from the sale or maturity of our short-term investments or available-for-sale securities, net of purchases. In addition, as part of our license and supply agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million in total to Zensun under two separate loan agreements. Pursuant to these agreements, we loaned $7.25 million in the first half of 2015, and $4.75 million to Zensun during the second half of 2014 (such lendings are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8), which is reflected in the $9.0 million and $6.2 million of net cash used in investing activities for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes by Zensun. To secure the loans, Zensun pledged its entire equity interest in its subsidiary, Shanghai Dongxin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (whose assets include real property) to SciClone Pharmaceuticals International China Holding Ltd ( SPIL China\u201d).\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8.4 million, $20.8 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we used $12.8 million, $24.4 million, and $12.5 million, respectively, to repurchase and retire approximately 1.5 million, 3.8 million, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we also received $4.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.7 million of proceeds, respectively, from the issuances of common stock made under our stock award plans. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our subsidiary borrowed $0.6 million and repaid $2.0 million under its loan agreement with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd that expired August 29, 2013. All amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date. Restricted cash of $2.3 million was released during the year ended December 31, 2013, that had been used to secure a letter of credit related to a loan agreement.\nIn December 2013, our subsidiary, NovaMed Shanghai, entered into a 10.0 million RMB revolving line of credit facility (approximately $1.6 million USD) and a maximum 15.0 million RMB loan facility (approximately $2.4 million USD) secured by its accounts receivable with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd. (the Credit Facility\u201d). In June 2014, NovaMed Shanghai repaid the 10.0 million RMB (approximately $1.6 million USD) under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility expired on November 30, 2014 and all amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following summarizes our other future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n (1) These are future minimum rental commitments for office space and copiers leased under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements. \n (2) These consist of purchase obligations with manufacturers and distributors. \n (3) As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which our obligations for unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the \u201dPayments Due by Period\u201d section of the table. \nUnder our $80.5 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1,526,306 shares at a cost of $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 bringing the total repurchases since the program's inception to approximately 13.2 million shares at a cost of $78.1 million through December 31, 2015. Our stock repurchase program expired December 31, 2015 and is currently under strategic review by the Board.\nWe recorded a charge of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the possibility of a settlement with the SEC and DOJ regarding their investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by us. Based on our discussions with the SEC, we recorded an additional $10.8 million in SEC settlement to operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, bringing the total loss to the government in penalties, fines and/or other remedies to $12.8 million. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the agreement, in February 2016, we paid $12.8 million including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty from our restricted escrow account that we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Notes 18 and 22 for further information on this matter.\nUnder our license agreements with third parties we have agreed to various milestone payments related to regulatory and commercial success and other achievements that may require substantial payments in the future.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. We have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to a registration statement. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies, product candidates or marketing territories. Additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or on favorable terms.\nWe intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations, in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and potential acquisitions, as may be required. In addition, as previously disclosed, our Board is evaluating a range of strategic transactions with a view to enhancing stockholder value. The unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long-term product development and commercialization programs, either of which could hurt our business. We cannot assure you that funds from financings, if any, will be sufficient to in-license additional products. The need, timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors, including the status of the pending regulatory investigations and pending litigations, the level and price of our products, the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to our products, the availability of complementary products, technologies and businesses, the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing, the timing of regulatory approvals, developments in relationships with existing or future\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncollaborative parties, the status of competitive products, and various alternatives for financing. We have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-sheet balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nGeneral\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue. We recognize product revenue from selling manufactured ZADAXIN product at the time of delivery. Sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm are recognized upon the arrival of a shipment to its destination when title and risk of loss to the product are transferred to them. We also earn product revenue from purchasing medical products from pharmaceutical companies and selling them directly to importers or distributors. We recognize revenue related to these products based on the sell-in\u201d method, when the medical products have been delivered to the importers or distributors. Payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors.\nPromotion Services Revenue. We recognize promotion services revenue after designated medical products are delivered to the distributors as specified in the promotion services contracts, which marks the period when marketing and promotion services have been rendered, and the revenue recognition criteria are met. In certain arrangements, we were required to return or refund a portion of promotion services fees received during interim periods from pharmaceutical customers if defined annual sales targets were not achieved. Under our agreements with these customers, if the agreement was terminated, and provided such targets had been met on a pro rata\u201d basis at the date of contract termination, we were entitled to retain the amounts paid. Due to these contractual provisions, we recognized revenue during interim periods without reduction for amounts subject to refund based on Method 2 of Accounting Standards Codification 605-20-S99-1, Accounting for Management Fees Based on a Formula.\u201d\nRevenue Reserve. We maintain a revenue reserve for product returns based on estimates of the amount of product to be returned by our customers which is based on historical patterns, analysis of market demand and/or a percentage of sales based on industry trends, and management's evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns. Importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality. However, we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. The calculation of the product returns reserve requires estimates and involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. As a result of the uncertainties involved in estimating the product returns reserve, there is a possibility that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenue reserves were approximately $0.1 million; the reserves were recorded as accrued liabilities on our consolidated balances sheets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe evaluate our returns reserve quarterly and adjust it when events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCLN) is a United States ( US\u201d)-headquartered, China-focused, specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders. We are focused on continuing to grow our revenue and profitability. Our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the People's Republic of China ( China\u201d or PRC\u201d) where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through many years of experience marketing our lead product, ZADAXIN\u00ae (thymalfasin). In addition, we have an established product promotion business model with large pharmaceutical partners and we are focused on establishing profitability in all of these collaborations. We believe our sales and marketing strengths position us to benefit from the long-term expansion of the pharmaceutical market in China. The Chinese pharmaceutical market currently ranks second among the global pharmaceutical markets, and had an estimated worth of $105 billion in 2014. It is forecasted to increase significantly to $200 billion by 2020. We seek to expand our presence in China and increase revenues by growing sales and profits of our current product portfolio, launching new products from our development pipeline, adding new, profitable product services agreements and leveraging our strong cash position to in-license additional products.\nWe operate in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers: 1) China and 2) the Rest of the World, which includes our US and Hong Kong operations.\nWe have two categories of revenues: product sales revenues\u201d and promotion services revenues.\u201d Our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in-licensed products, including our lead product, ZADAXIN; DC Bead\u00ae, a product for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors, for which we initiated sales and recorded product revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2015, and products from Pfizer International Trading (Shanghai) Ltd. ( Pfizer\u201d). Through June 30, 2015, our product sales revenues also included Aggrastat\u00ae, an intervention cardiology product launched in China in 2009, in-licensed from Cardiome Pharma Corp ( Cardiome\u201d). In August 2015, we and Cardiome mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, thereby terminating our exclusive distribution rights in China, and returning all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nZADAXIN has the highest margins in our portfolio as it is a premium product sold exclusively by SciClone. In addition, we anticipate that new marketed products, when and if introduced, can increase the future revenues and profitability of our pharmaceutical business in China over the coming years. Our promotion services revenues\u201d result primarily from fees we receive for exclusively promoting products in China for Baxter International, Inc. ( Baxter\u201d). We recognize promotion services revenues as a percentage of our collaborators' product sales revenue for these exclusively promoted products. Over time, as additional proprietary or in-licensed products come to the market, we aim to shift our product mix towards those products providing higher margins for us.\nZADAXIN is approved in over 30 countries and may be used for the treatment of HBV, HCV, and certain cancers, and as an immune system enhancer according to the local regulatory approvals we have in these countries. In China, thymalfasin is included in the treatment guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health ( MOH\u201d) for liver cancer, as well as guidelines for treatment of chronic HBV (issued by both the Chinese Medical Association and the Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver) and invasive fungal infections of critically ill patients (issued by the Chinese Medical Association). Our sales force is focused on increasing sales to the country's largest hospitals (class 3A with over 500 beds) as well as mid-size hospitals (class 2A). These hospitals serve Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities located mostly in the eastern part of China, which are the largest and generally have the most affluent populations. We are widening our market strategies by piloting e-commerce approaches to reach customers. We are also seeking to expand the indications for which ZADAXIN could be used, including sepsis.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe initiated sales and recorded our first product revenue from DC Bead in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The China Food and Drug Administration had approved the registration of DC Bead for the embolization of malignant hypervascularized tumors in August 2014. DC Bead may be used to treat liver cancer, a large and growing indication in China, and we believe our oncology sales team and academic marketing liaisons have established high quality relationships with medical professionals and institutions that specialize in cancer treatment, which we believe will be a valuable asset as we continue commercial sales of DC Bead. BioCompatibles UK Ltd. ( BTG\u201d) and SciClone previously entered into an agreement granting SciClone exclusive licensing and distribution rights to DC Bead in China. Under the agreement, we are purchasing DC Bead product from BTG.\nWe are also pursuing the registration of several other therapeutic products in China. These include: Loramyc\u00ae, a mucoadhesive tablet formulation of miconazole lauriad to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis; and RapidFilm\u00ae, an oral film formulation of ondansetron to treat nausea induced by chemotherapy.\nOur agreement with Baxter is for a 5-year term, through December 2017, and our agreement with Pfizer is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. We are pursuing additional agreements to generate additional revenue. We continue to seek in-licensing arrangements for well-differentiated products at various stages of development that, if not yet approved, have a defined regulatory approval pathway in China. Our objective is to in-license products that provide us with higher margins, augmenting our product sales revenue and profitability, and we continue to explore opportunities to optimize our promotion services revenues.\nIn May 2015, Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ( Theravance Biopharma\u201d) granted SciClone exclusive development and commercialization rights to VIBATIV\u00ae (telavancin) in China, as well as the Hong Kong SAR, the Macau SAR, Taiwan and Vietnam, in exchange for upfront and regulatory milestone payments totaling $6 million. SciClone will be responsible for all aspects of development and commercialization in the partnered regions, including pre- and post-launch activities and product registration. SciClone will initially develop VIBATIV for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, and additional indications may include complicated skin and skin structure infections and potentially bacteremia. Theravance Biopharma will sell to SciClone all clinical and commercial product required to develop and commercialize VIBATIV in China and our other licensed territories.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with The Medicines Company for two cardiovascular products in China. The partnership includes an agreement granting us a license and the exclusive rights in China to promote two products including 1) Angiomax\u00ae (bivalirudin) for Injection, an anticoagulant indicated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) and in patients with, or at risk of, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome undergoing PCI for which a Phase 3 registration trial was completed in China and is currently under review by the China Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval, and 2) Cleviprex\u00ae (clevidipine) Injectable Emulsion, a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker indicated for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable for which a clinical trial application (CTA) for China was filed in 2013. We received CTA approval from the China Food and Drug Administration ( CFDA\u201d) in early 2016 and are preparing a clinical study. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization, including pre-and post-launch activities, for both products in the China market (excluding Hong Kong and Macao). We have also agreed to participate in the China registration process for both products. Financial terms of the agreement, in addition to net sales royalties payable to The Medicines Company, include the following additional payments to The Medicines Company: an upfront payment made in the fourth quarter of 2014; a project support services fee; and regulatory/commercial success milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $50.5 million.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Taiwan Liposome Company ( TLC\u201d) which granted us a license and the exclusive rights in China, Hong Kong and Macao to promote, market, distribute and sell ProFlow\u00ae for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD\u201d) and other indications. PAD is a serious cardiovascular condition in which blood flow to the limbs (usually the legs) is restricted due to arterial plaque build-up. Under the terms of the agreement, TLC will be responsible for the continued development including potential clinical trials and regulatory activities, as well as the manufacture and supply of ProFlow, and we will be responsible for all aspects of commercialization including pre-and post-launch activities. The agreement provides for the principal terms of the arrangement between SciClone and TLC, and in March 2014, the companies entered into a supplemental collaboration and license agreement. In November 2014, TLC was notified by the CFDA that ProFlow did not receive clinical trial approval and TLC is in the process of appealing the decision.\nIn May 2013, we entered into a framework agreement with Zensun (Shanghai) Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ( Zensun\u201d) for the exclusive promotion, marketing, distribution and sale of NeucardinTM in China, Hong Kong and Macao. Neucardin is a novel,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfirst-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of patients with intermediate to advanced heart failure, for which a New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) was submitted to and accepted for review by the CFDA in 2012. In December 2013, the CFDA informed Zensun that its Phase 2 data is insufficient, and has asked Zensun to submit a new NDA once the ongoing Phase 3 study reached its endpoints. As part of our agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million to Zensun, of which $12 million had been loaned as of December 31, 2015 (refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 for further information regarding the Zensun loans).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $7.5 million, $11 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in research and development expenses related to our in-license arrangements.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. We were able to mitigate the impact of this price limitation by shifting an equitable portion of the burden of the price reduction to our distributor in our sales channel; accordingly, the impact of the price reduction through the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.8 million. We anticipate that provincial pricing decisions will continue to be a significant factor in the China pharmaceutical market for the foreseeable future. The impact of such decisions on our future results is unpredictable, but we expect that pricing pressures on revenue in 2016 will be offset at least in significant part through sharing of the burden with our China distributor and potentially through volume increases. However, in the future, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm Holding Lingyun Biopharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (Sinopharm), our China distributor for ZADAXIN, which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nAs previously disclosed, since 2010 the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) and the US Department of Justice ( DOJ\u201d) had each been conducting formal investigations of us regarding a range of matters, including the possibility of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA\u201d). On February 4, 2016, we announced that we have entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid a total of $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a penalty as final settlement which was released from our restricted escrow account which we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. This payment is in line with the charges we previously recorded and disclosed in our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 10, 2015. As part of the agreement we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action (refer to Notes 18 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 and Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 for further information regarding the SEC and DOJ investigations).\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. Our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report losses in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nResults of Operations\nRevenues:\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our product sales and promotion services revenues (in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct Sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>154,329 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>131,973 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>99,414 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPromotion Services\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,928 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,817 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-90%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>27,644 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Net Revenues\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>157,257 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>134,790 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>6% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>127,058 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales were $154.3 million, $132.0 million, and $99.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase of $22.4 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $126.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $20.0 million, or 16%, which mainly related to a 21% increase in volume sold, offset partially by a 5% decrease in selling price mainly related to a decrease in the list price of ZADAXIN in the Zhejiang province since May 2015. Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, also included Pfizer product sales and initial immaterial DC Bead revenue.\nThe increase in product sales of $32.6 million, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and stronger demand for certain oncology products. ZADAXIN sales were $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $96.3 million for the prior year, an increase of $29.8 million, or 31%, which mainly related to an increase in volume sold, and to a lesser extent related to an increase in selling price. We believe our ZADAXIN product revenues in the first half of fiscal 2013 were adversely affected by the increase in channel inventory we experienced in the third quarter of 2012. We believe channel inventory for ZADAXIN has returned to normalized levels.\nWe anticipate that ZADAXIN revenues in 2016 will be higher than 2015, although our revenues are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and provincial adjustments to tender (retail level, government approved) prices which we cannot predict. The majority of our sales have been in US dollars, although a portion of our sales are denominated in RMB. Per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm through December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm (our sole importer and distributor for ZADAXIN in China) which took effect January 1, 2016, our sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm have been and continue to be denominated in US dollars. However, the established importer price may be adjusted quarterly based upon exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and RMB. Our China ZADAXIN sales revenues are subject to exchange rate risk, and in recent months the RMB has experienced devaluation. In addition, per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which took effect January 1, 2016, our contracted sales prices to Sinopharm are subject to adjustment based on changes in tender prices within the province territories. In addition, our new contractual arrangement with Sinopharm which commenced January 1, 2016 will result in the later recognition (relative to practices prevailing through December 31, 2015) of a portion of our revenue invoiced to Sinopharm in situations where the provincial tender price is greater relative to a referenced (baseline) tender price. This is due to a mechanism in the new contractual arrangement whereby the customer is invoiced at a lower base price relative to that prevailing in the previous agreement. The lower base price (as well as estimated price compensation payable due to the distributor for situations where the provincial tender price is lower than the referenced (baseline) tender price) will be recorded as revenue after the sale is completed. The distributor will then be invoiced for the portion of the price that may result from situations where the provincial tender price is greater than the referenced (baseline) tender price at a later time, and such amount will be recognized as revenue after the amount has been agreed to with the distributor. Although we do not expect this new arrangement to have a significant impact on annual revenue or the amount recognized on an annual basis, it may impact quarterly revenue amounts and timing, especially for the first quarter of 2016.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs effective as of June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities appear to be emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in April 2015 that became effective in May 2015. Changes in provincial drug prices for ZADAXIN in the provinces could impact our future sales revenues.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn China, pharmaceutical products are imported and distributed through a tiered method of distribution. For our proprietary product ZADAXIN, we manufacture our product using our US and European contract manufacturers, and we generate our product sales revenue through sales of ZADAXIN product to Sinopharm. Sinopharm acts as an importer, and also as the top tier\u201d of the distribution system ( Tier 1\u201d) in China. Our ZADAXIN sales occur when Sinopharm purchases product from us without any right of return except for replacement of product in the event of damaged product or quality control issues. Passage of title and risk of loss are transferred to Sinopharm at the time of arrival of a shipment at its destination. After the sale, Sinopharm clears products through China import customs, sells directly to large hospitals and holds additional product it has purchased in inventory for sale to the next tier in the distribution system. The second-tier ( Tier 2\u201d) distributors are responsible for the further sale and distribution of the products they purchase from the importer, either through sales of product directly to the retail level (hospitals and pharmacies), or to third-tier ( Tier 3\u201d) local or regional distributors who, in turn, sell products to hospitals and pharmacies.\nPromotion services revenue was $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and related to products promoted under agreements with Baxter and Sanofi Aventis S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d). Promotion services revenue increased $0.1 million or 4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, related to an increase in EndoxanTM (Baxter) product sales. Promotion services revenue decreased $24.8 million or 90% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, related to the expiration of our promotional agreements with Sanofi as of December 31, 2013.\nOur promotion agreements with Sanofi, consisting of individual promotional agreements for certain pharmaceutical products and supplementary agreements extending the terms thereof, were not renewed and expired on December 31, 2013. NovaMed Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. ( NovaMed Shanghai\u201d) and Sanofi negotiated a settlement of certain amounts in dispute, effective as of July 14, 2014, and NovaMed Shanghai received approximately 22 million RMB (approximately $3.5 million) in August 2014 as final payment from Sanofi. The terms of the settlement resulted in the recognition of promotion services revenue, for the second quarter of 2014, of approximately $0.2 million of Sanofi revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013. The remaining approximately $2.6 million of deferred revenue that had been deferred in the fourth quarter of 2013 was reversed with an equivalent write-down of accounts receivable. This contemporaneous write-down of accounts receivable and deferred revenue had no impact on net income for the second quarter of 2014 or for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, with Sanofi were $0, $0.2 million, and $25.0 million, respectively.\nOur Baxter promotion agreement is for a 5-year term, through December 2017. Our Pfizer product distribution agreement is for a 5-year term, through June 2019. In August 2015, we and Cardiome, from whom we licensed Aggrastat\u00ae, mutually agreed to end our collaboration for Aggrastat, and return all rights to the product to Cardiome. We recorded Aggrastat revenues of $1.8 million, $1.1 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we do not expect to generate any further Aggrastat revenues. We do not anticipate that the termination of this agreement will adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continue to assess the financial performance of the products we promote and distribute under our agreements and their overall value within our entire portfolio of products. Over time, we anticipate the product mix that we promote will change, which may affect our revenues and profitability in the future. If any of these agreements are determined to no longer be beneficial to us and are allowed to expire, or if third parties will not renegotiate, renew or extend the agreements on terms acceptable to us, our revenues would be adversely affected and our profitability may be adversely or beneficially affected. On the other hand, if we are successful in negotiating better terms, there may be a positive impact on our revenues and profitability.\nAll of our promotion services revenue and a majority of our product revenues related to our China segment. Total China revenues were $151.6 million, $130.3 million, and $122.6 million, or 96%, 97% and 97% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Sinopharm and Sanofi in China accounted for approximately 75% and 20% of our revenues, respectively, (prior to the expiration of our promotion agreements with Sanofi).

The decrease in cost of sales of $0.7 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in cost of product sales of Aggrastat as we had recorded a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory during the year ended December 31, 2014 that didn't recur for the year ended December 31, 2015. It was also attributable to our receipt in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $1.1 million for reimbursement for Aggrastat inventory returned that we had previously fully written off in 2014, which was recorded as a reduction in cost of product sales. These decreases in cost of product sales were partially offset by increases in cost of product sales related to ZADAXIN and certain oncology product sales due to increased volume sold. Cost of product sales also increased related to initial DC Bead sales in the second half of 2015.\nThe increase in cost of sales of $5.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, was attributable to a $2.0 million increase in ZADAXIN cost of product sales related primarily to an increase in ZADAXIN unit sales and a $3.3 million increase in Aggrastat and oncology cost of sales as a result of higher sales volume of Aggrastat and certain oncology products. Cost of sales for Aggrastat product also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to a provision of $2.1 million for excess Aggrastat inventory expected to expire and $0.2 million associated with Aggrastat inventory shipped within six months of expiration.\nZADAXIN cost of sales were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $17.5 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross margin for ZADAXIN was 87.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 86.1% and 83.9% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in gross margin for ZADAXIN for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was due primarily to higher production volume lowering per unit overhead costs and manufacturing efficiencies.\nWe expect our ZADAXIN cost of product sales and gross margins to fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of sales and price of our products, the absorption of product-related fixed costs, currency exchange fluctuations, any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory, and the timing of other inventory period costs such as manufacturing process improvements for the goal of future cost reductions.\nOverall, we expect our gross margin percentages in 2016 to be lower than 2015, based on lower selling prices as set by one province, with indications of others to follow, as well as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange fluctuations.\nSales and Marketing ( S&M\u201d):\nThe following table summarizes the year over year changes in our sales and marketing expenses (in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and Marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>53,961 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>48,477 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-12%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55,240 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nS&M expenses were $54.0 million, $48.5 million, and $55.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Under the terms of the settlement agreement, in February 2016 we paid $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty as final settlement. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any actions. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Note 18 Contingencies\u201d and Note 22 Subsequent Events\u201d for further information on this matter.\nOther Income:\nOn July 8, 2013, we and the representatives of the former stockholders of NovaMed entered into a Confidential Escrow Settlement Agreement\u201d pursuant to which we retained approximately $0.8 million in cash and 342,300 shares of our common stock, having a combined fair value of approximately $2.6 million on the settlement date. As a result, we recorded $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to other income related to this settlement.\nProvision for Income Tax:\nThe provision for income tax relates to our foreign operations in China. The provision for income tax was $0.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tax expense decreased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, mainly related to a reduction in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) in China due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations.\nThe tax provision decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, principally due to a reduction of approximately $0.2 million in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions (and associated accrued interest) due to certain tax years becoming closed to assessment due to the statute of limitations. Tax expense was also lower for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of lower taxable income related to our China operations.\nThe statutory tax rate in China was 25% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect the provision for income tax to increase for the year ending December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in our China operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards for US federal income tax purposes of approximately $114.2 million that expire in the years 2020 through 2035, and had approximately $52 million in net operating loss carryforwards related to our NovaMed Shanghai subsidiary that expire in the years 2016-2020. As of December 31, 2015, we had US federal research and development, orphan drug and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.2 million that expire in the years 2018 through 2035.\nBecause of the change in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. We rely on our operating cash flows, and cash and cash equivalents to provide for our liquidity requirements. We believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months to fund our working capital requirements of our operations, including investments in our business, and to fund our business development activities.\nThe following tables summarize our cash and investments and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the years presented (in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and investments\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>101,403 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>86,303 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $101.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, in addition to the $12.8 million of restricted cash held in escrow for the SEC settlement, of which $98.5 million was located in subsidiaries of the Company outside the US. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the US are held primarily in US dollars. Such cash and cash equivalents are used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations, which may include in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and for potential acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we repatriated $12.8 million in funds via a special dividend distribution from our foreign subsidiary as a result of the need to fund an escrow facility for our SEC settlement (as previously described). This dividend distribution was made from the current year earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary, which was not part of the cumulative pool of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014.\nWe have determined that as of December 31, 2015, $176.2 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, after the payment of the dividend which was satisfied entirely out of current year earnings and profits, continues to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the US. In making this determination, the following attributes were considered: (i) the expected future needs of the foreign subsidiaries, including working capital, capital expenditures, as well as additional investments to support the infrastructure in our China subsidiaries and (ii) additional investments to support our expansion in the China market as well as planned product licensing transactions. Upon distribution of our foreign undistributed earnings, we may be subject to US federal and state income taxes. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2015, but we do anticipate a need to repatriate a portion of future foreign earnings to fund our US operations. We will accrue for US income taxes on future foreign earnings that we anticipate repatriating from our foreign subsidiaries.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>32,507 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>27,609 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>9,502 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(9,010) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(6,203) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>55 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,419) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(20,806) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(8,353) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We reserved an amount of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a bad debt charge recorded in general and administrative expense related to a customer whose receivable balance was past due which we subsequently wrote off when we determined it to be uncollectible during the fourth quarter of 2015. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year's period, mainly related to the additional $10.8 million SEC settlement expense recorded to operating expense related to the settlement with the SEC. Restricted cash in escrow for the SEC settlement increased $12.8 million related to the $12.8 million SEC settlement amount deposited in escrow during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, provisions for expiring inventory, depreciation and amortization expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, we had accounts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreceivable totaling approximately $0.9 million from a single customer, which were substantially delinquent and which we were actively trying to collect, and for which we had recorded a reserve of $0.9 million. We entered into a settlement agreement with the customer in October 2014 to collect the remaining balance (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8). Accounts receivable increased $3.3 million mainly related to an increase in ZADAXIN sales. Inventory decreased $5.9 million mainly related to ZADAXIN inventory sales during the first half of 2014 exceeding our purchase levels, excluding approximately $2.9 million in Pfizer and Aggrastat inventory not yet paid for as of December 31, 2014. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $5.9 million mainly related to sales and marketing and manufacturing expense payments made during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and primarily reflected the net income for the period, adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash escrow share settlement, loss on maturity of available-for-sale investments, provision for losses on accounts receivable, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $4.0 million related to an increase in our ZADAXIN sales during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to the same quarter of 2012 when there was excess inventory of ZADAXIN in the channel. Inventory increased $4.7 million due to the completion our new manufacturing process and processing of new batches.\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($9.0) million, ($6.2) million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, purchases of property and equipment were $1.8 million, $1.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, we received proceeds of $0.1 million and $0.4 million from the sale or maturity of our short-term investments or available-for-sale securities, net of purchases. In addition, as part of our license and supply agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million in total to Zensun under two separate loan agreements. Pursuant to these agreements, we loaned $7.25 million in the first half of 2015, and $4.75 million to Zensun during the second half of 2014 (such lendings are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8), which is reflected in the $9.0 million and $6.2 million of net cash used in investing activities for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes by Zensun. To secure the loans, Zensun pledged its entire equity interest in its subsidiary, Shanghai Dongxin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (whose assets include real property) to SciClone Pharmaceuticals International China Holding Ltd ( SPIL China\u201d).\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8.4 million, $20.8 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we used $12.8 million, $24.4 million, and $12.5 million, respectively, to repurchase and retire approximately 1.5 million, 3.8 million, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we also received $4.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.7 million of proceeds, respectively, from the issuances of common stock made under our stock award plans. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our subsidiary borrowed $0.6 million and repaid $2.0 million under its loan agreement with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd that expired August 29, 2013. All amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date. Restricted cash of $2.3 million was released during the year ended December 31, 2013, that had been used to secure a letter of credit related to a loan agreement.\nIn December 2013, our subsidiary, NovaMed Shanghai, entered into a 10.0 million RMB revolving line of credit facility (approximately $1.6 million USD) and a maximum 15.0 million RMB loan facility (approximately $2.4 million USD) secured by its accounts receivable with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd. (the Credit Facility\u201d). In June 2014, NovaMed Shanghai repaid the 10.0 million RMB (approximately $1.6 million USD) under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility expired on November 30, 2014 and all amounts borrowed were repaid by the expiration date.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe following summarizes our other future contractual obligations as of

Based on our discussions with the SEC, we recorded an additional $10.8 million in SEC settlement to operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, bringing the total loss to the government in penalties, fines and/or other remedies to $12.8 million. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC's investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. Under the terms of the agreement, in February 2016, we paid $12.8 million including disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a penalty from our restricted escrow account that we funded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As part of the agreement, we neither admitted nor denied engagement in any wrongdoing and we agreed to give status reports to the SEC for the next three years on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures. The DOJ has also completed its related investigation and has declined to pursue any action. Refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Notes 18 and 22 for further information on this matter.\nUnder our license agreements with third parties we have agreed to various milestone payments related to regulatory and commercial success and other achievements that may require substantial payments in the future.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. We have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to a registration statement. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies, product candidates or marketing territories. Additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or on favorable terms.\nWe intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations, in-licensing new products, particularly for China, and potential acquisitions, as may be required. In addition, as previously disclosed, our Board is evaluating a range of strategic transactions with a view to enhancing stockholder value. The unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long-term product development and commercialization programs, either of which could hurt our business. We cannot assure you that funds from financings, if any, will be sufficient to in-license additional products. The need, timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors, including the status of the pending regulatory investigations and pending litigations, the level and price of our products, the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to our products, the availability of complementary products, technologies and businesses, the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing, the timing of regulatory approvals, developments in relationships with existing or future\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncollaborative parties, the status of competitive products, and various alternatives for financing. We have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-sheet balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nGeneral\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nProduct Revenue. We recognize product revenue from selling manufactured ZADAXIN product at the time of delivery. Sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm are recognized upon the arrival of a shipment to its destination when title and risk of loss to the product are transferred to them. We also earn product revenue from purchasing medical products from pharmaceutical companies and selling them directly to importers or distributors. We recognize revenue related to these products based on the sell-in\u201d method, when the medical products have been delivered to the importers or distributors. Payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors.\nPromotion Services Revenue. We recognize promotion services revenue after designated medical products are delivered to the distributors as specified in the promotion services contracts, which marks the period when marketing and promotion services have been rendered, and the revenue recognition criteria are met. In certain arrangements, we were required to return or refund a portion of promotion services fees received during interim periods from pharmaceutical customers if defined annual sales targets were not achieved. Under our agreements with these customers, if the agreement was terminated, and provided such targets had been met on a pro rata\u201d basis at the date of contract termination, we were entitled to retain the amounts paid. Due to these contractual provisions, we recognized revenue during interim periods without reduction for amounts subject to refund based on Method 2 of Accounting Standards Codification 605-20-S99-1, Accounting for Management Fees Based on a Formula.\u201d\nRevenue Reserve. We maintain a revenue reserve for product returns based on estimates of the amount of product to be returned by our customers which is based on historical patterns, analysis of market demand and/or a percentage of sales based on industry trends, and management's evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns. Importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality. However, we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered. The calculation of the product returns reserve requires estimates and involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. As a result of the uncertainties involved in estimating the product returns reserve, there is a possibility that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenue reserves were approximately $0.1 million; the reserves were recorded as accrued liabilities on our consolidated balances sheets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe evaluate our returns reserve quarterly and adjust it when events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate.", "summary": "- SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a US-headquartered, China-focused, specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business in China and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders.\n- We are focused on continuing to grow our revenue and profitability in China, the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world.\n- Our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the People's Republic of China (China) where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through many years of experience marketing our lead product, ZADAXIN\u00ae (thymalfasin).\n- We operate in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers: 1) China and 2) the Rest of the World, which includes our US and Hong Kong operations.\n- We have two categories of revenues: product sales revenues and promotion services revenues.\n- Our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in-licensed products, including our lead product, ZADAXIN;"}
