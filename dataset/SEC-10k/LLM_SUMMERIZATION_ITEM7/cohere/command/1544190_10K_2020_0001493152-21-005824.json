MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(All dollar [$] amounts shown in thousands.)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOverview\nWe were organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the name 84 RE Partners, LLC and changed our name to Shepherd's Finance, LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. Our business is focused on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market is underserved because of the lack of traditional lenders currently participating in the market. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Our operations are governed pursuant to our limited liability company agreement.\nThe commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In some circumstances, the lot is purchased with an older home on the lot which is then either removed or rehabilitated. If the home is rehabilitated, the loan is referred to as a rehab\u201d loan. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of lots and undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position and the opportunities available to us, do none, any or all of the following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate or other collateral), purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we will operate our business.\nEconomic and Industry Dynamics\nThe Company has been impacted by and continues to face risks related to COVID-19, which has caused disruptions to the economy and in all of the markets in which the Company lends. The Company's operating results depend significantly on the homebuilding industry.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company had 46 loans at a gross loans receivable balance of $12,993 of impaired loans primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,492 in loan loss expense and $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's number of impaired loans reduced by 17 loans to 29 compared to the 46 impaired loans as of June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the 29 impaired gross loans receivable balance was $11,816 which was primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,533 in loan loss expense, $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets and $469 in direct write-offs of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company continues to lose interest income on assets that do not accrue interest. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the estimated loss on interest income related to impaired and foreclosed assets was $1,150. Looking ahead, we expect this to decrease in the first half of 2021.\nFinally, the impact of COVID-19 and prior to COVID-19 is the lack of loan originations which impacts our earnings through the loss of fee income. Loan originations and fee income for the first five months of 2020 and 2019 was $11,166 and $886 and $30,605 and $1,411, respectively. For the last seven months of 2020, loan originations increased to $42,390 compared to $28,165 for the same period of 2019. We anticipate this rate of increase to continue through 2021.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResponse to COVID-19\nAs a result of the potential impact of COVID-19, we suspended originations of new loans as of March 20, 2020 in order to maintain our liquidity and based on our expectation that home values would likely decrease in the near future. We initially told all of our borrowers that we will fund all loans where the underlying home is already under construction, and advised them to build as quickly as possible to bring the homes on the market as soon as possible. For loans where the borrower has not yet begun construction of the underlying home, we initially told them that we would not fund construction and they should therefore not start construction.\nDuring April 2020, as the Company continued to monitor market conditions overall and in the specific markets in which the Company lends, the Company observed that some markets had little to no impact from a housing perspective as a result of COVID-19; however, the Company's borrowers in Pennsylvania and Michigan were significantly impacted due to the government shutting down home construction completely, and customers in Florida were significantly impacted by the changes in lending rules for end users and the high levels of unemployment caused by COVID-19. The Company made the decision to fund new loans to borrowers in stronger markets for the purpose of developing presold homes, which loans have reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company continued to monitor funding spec loans in some markets on a case-by-case basis for loans with reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company stopped recognizing interest on loans issued to customers impacted by COVID-19 and is expected to continue until those loans are paid off.\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company made the decision to reopen lending under normal, pre-COVID-19 terms for a limited group of certain of its customers. In addition, the decision was made to allow rehab loans to builders at terms that are less conservative than those established in April 2020 but more conservative than terms prior to the arrival of COVID-19. At that point, the Company was offering normal terms to approximately 40% of its customers, and restricted terms to approximately 60% of its customers. In the second half of 2020, the Company slowly increased the percentage of customers with normal terms to near 100% by the end of the year. The Company averaged $2,233 in new loan originations in the first five months of 2020, but under the adjusted terms the Company averaged $6,056 of loan originations in June through December 2020. The fees from these originations are typically recognized over 12 months. New loan fees from these seven months before deferred loan origination costs were $1,849, which we will recognize over 12 months. The Company attributes this increase in volume to many of its larger nonbank competitors going out of business or leaving the lending business. In the second and third quarters, all builders who we told not to build on lots we had closed on in the first quarter were allowed to build the homes. All but five of those homes has started construction, and many are finished and paid off.\nWe are continuously monitoring the markets, builders, and the COVID-19 situation for the remaining loans which we have not yet released for construction. Management anticipates revisiting these lending parameters during 2021 as the COVID-19 situation continues to develop. However, due to the continued cases of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still economic uncertainties that could negatively impact net income (loss). Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerceived Challenges and Anticipated Responses\nThe following is not intended to represent a comprehensive list or description of the risks or challenges facing the Company. Currently, our management is most focused on the following challenges along with the corresponding actions to address those challenges:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Perceived Challenges and Risks </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Anticipated Management Actions/Response </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Potential loan value-to-collateral value issues (i.e., being underwater on particular loans) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>We manage this challenge by risk-rating both the geographic region and the builder, and then adjusting the loan-to-value (i.e., the loan amount versus the value of the collateral) based on risk assessments. Additionally, we collect a deposit up-front for construction loans. Despite these efforts, if values in a particular area of the country drop by 60%, we will have loaned more than the value of the collateral. We have found that the best solution to this risk is a speedy resolution of the loan, and helping the builder finish the home rapidly rather than foreclosing on the partially built home. Our experience in this area will help us limit, but not eliminate, the negative effects in the event of another economic downturn. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Concentration of loan portfolio (i.e., how many of the loans are of or with any particular type, customer, or geography) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 29% and 25% of our outstanding loan commitments consist of loans to one borrower, and the collateral is in one real estate market, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a significant portion of these loans is susceptible to changes in market conditions in that area. As of December 31, 2020, our next two largest customers make up 12% and 6% of our loan commitments, with loans in Orlando, Florida and Cape Coral, Florida, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, our next two largest customers made up 15% and 3% of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Savannah, Georgia, respectively. In the upcoming years, we plan on continuing to increase our geographic and builder diversity while continuing to focus on our residential homebuilder customers. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Not having funds available to us to service the commitments we have </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020, our typical construction loan had about 68% of its loan amount outstanding on average. That means that on average, about 32% of the commitment is not loaned, usually because the house is not complete. As of December 31, 2020, unfunded commitments totaled $19,495, which we will fund along with our purchase and sale agreement participants. However, if we are short on cash, we could do the following:\n\u25cf raise interest rates on the Notes we offer to our investors to attract new Note investments;\n\u25cf sell more secured interest on our loans; or\n\u25cf draw down on our lines of credit from our affiliates.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonpayment of interest by our customers </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Most of our customers pay interest on a monthly basis, and these funds are used to, among other things, pay interest on our debt monthly. While we have the liquidity to withstand some nonpayment of interest, if a high percentage of our customers were not paying interest, it will impede our ability to pay our debts on time. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonperforming assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets were approximately $14,568 (defined as impaired loans and/or loans on nonaccrual plus foreclosed assets net of reserves). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpportunities\nThe Company anticipates an increase in profit in 2021 compared to 2020. To achieve these increases in profits, the Company is focused on the following four things:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>1. </td> <td>First, the Company is focused on reducing the number of assets currently not paying interest. Due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred 31 loans with a total loan receivable, net balance of $8,687 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the total loans for this certain borrower classified as impaired assets decreased by 15 to 16 with a total loan receivable, net balance of $6,906. The Company's reduction of non-performing assets are expected to be achieved by a combination of the selling of foreclosed assets and the payoff of nonperforming loans;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2. </td> <td>Second, the Company is focused on continuing the higher level of new loan originations that the Company did not realize during the first five months of 2020. Average originations during the first five months and last seven months ended December 31, 2020 was $2,233 and $6,056, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Third, the Company seeks to have the cash to fund new originations through new financing and the potential reduction of nonperforming assets;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>Fourth, lowering the Company's cost of funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that the housing market in most of the areas in which we do business will be strong despite the impact of COVID-19. We also anticipate that the losses we incurred in principal related to COVID-19 will not continue, and that the lack of interest due to nonperforming assets from COVID-19 will decrease significantly over the course of the first half of 2021.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTo assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nLoan Losses\nFuture losses on current loans are estimated in our financial statements. This estimate is important because it is on our largest asset (loans receivable). It is impossible to know what these losses will be, as the condition of the market cannot be determined, and specific situations with each loan are unpredictable and change constantly. Loan losses, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the number of losses to capture during the current year. This current period amount incurred is referred to as the loan loss provision. The calculation of our allowance for loan losses, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to Loans receivable, net and is detailed in the notes to our financial statements, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the number of probable losses inherent in our commercial lending operations and to reflect that estimated risk in our allowance calculations. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nWe establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of each quarter. This collective reserve includes both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. In addition to historical loss information, the analysis incorporates collateral value, decisions made by management and staff, percentage of aging spec loans, policies, procedures, and economic conditions.\nWe individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past are due at the end of each quarter. We also review for impairment all loans to one borrower with greater than or equal to 10% of our total committed balances. If required, the analysis includes a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan.\nFor impaired loans, if the value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and some loans may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed basis and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.\nFor loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last 13 months if construction is greater than 90% complete. If construction is less than 90% complete the Company uses the latest appraisal on file. Certain times the Company may choose to use a broker's opinions of value ( BOV\u201d) as a replacement for an appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal. Broker's opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker's opinion of value.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAppraisers are state certified, and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent who works in that geographic area.\nCurrently, fair value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision. Specifically, relevant to the allowance for loan loss reserve is the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances. Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Due to a rapidly changing economic market, an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be used to develop fair value estimates, and the various assumptions that could be used, determining the collateral's fair value requires significant judgment.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\nLoan Loss\nProvision\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Fair Value Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>Higher/(Lower) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35%* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Decreasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35%** </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Increases in the fair value of the real estate collateral do not impact the loan loss provision, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d\n** If the loans were nonperforming, assuming a book amount of the loans outstanding of $46,405, and the fair value of the real estate collateral on all outstanding loans was reduced by 35%.\nForeclosed Assets\nForeclosed assets, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the amount of impairment to capture when a loan is converted to a foreclosed asset, the impairment when the value of an asset drops below the carrying amount, and any loss or gain upon final disposition of the asset. The calculation of the impairment, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the asset, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the value of the asset and therefore any required impairment thereof. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nFor properties which exist in the condition in which we intend to sell them, we obtain an appraisal of the assets current value. We reduce the appraised value by 10% to account for estimated selling costs. This amount is used to initially book the asset. Typically, prior to the initial booking of the foreclosed asset, the loan has already been reserved to this level. If during ownership, the value of the foreclosed asset drops, an additional impairment is recorded. For assets that need to be improved prior to sale, we adjust the portion of the appraised value related to construction improvements for the percentage of the improvements which have not yet been made.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fair value of real estate will impact our foreclosed asset value, which is recorded at 100% of fair value (after selling costs are deducted). Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020\nForeclosed Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Fair Value Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>Higher/(Lower) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35%* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Decreasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Increases in the fair value of the foreclosed assets do not impact the carrying value, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d Those gains would be recognized at the sale of the asset. However, the increase in fair value may be recognized up to the cost basis of the foreclosed asset which was determined at the foreclosure date.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as courts, arbitrators, juries, or regulators.\nAccounting and Auditing Standards Applicable to Emerging Growth Companies\u201d\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company,\u201d we are not required to: (1) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (2) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer or (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period discussed in (4), and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOther significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Policies related to credit quality information, fair value measurements, offsetting assets and liabilities, related party transactions and revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple and recent changes in the authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination or have recently been addressed by accounting standard setters and regulators. Specific conclusions have not been reached by these standard setters, and outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, as they discuss accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nKey financial and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below. For a more complete understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and the other information contained in this document.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require that we report financial and descriptive information about reportable segments and how these segments were determined. Our management determines the allocation and performance of resources based on operating income, net income and operating cash flows. Segments are identified and aggregated based on the products sold or services provided and the market(s) they serve. Based on these factors, management has determined that our ongoing operations are in one segment, commercial lending.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td>

As of December 31, 2020, we had 213 construction loans in 21 states with 67 borrowers and nine development loans in five states with eight borrowers.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Spread\nThe following table displays a comparison of our interest income, expense, fees and spread for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated unearned interest income due to COVID-19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,099 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write-offs due to COVID-19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fee income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and fee income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - secured </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - unsecured </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Offering costs amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,7580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (spread) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average outstanding loan asset balance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*annualized amount as percentage of weighted average outstanding gross loan balance\nThere are three main components that can impact our interest spread:\n\u25cf Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings). The loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum cost of funds of 7%. For most loans, the margin is fixed at 3%; however, for our development loans the margin is generally fixed at 7%. This component is also impacted by the lending of money with no interest cost (our equity).\nInterest income on loans decreased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 14% for the same periods of 2019. The Company expensed $469 in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to impairment of loans associated with four of our borrowers directly related to COVID-19. In addition, estimated interest not earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to those borrowers was approximately $1,099.\nThe difference between estimated interest income on loans ignoring the impact of COVID-19 and the interest paid was 3% for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 which is our standard margin.\nWe anticipate our standard margin to be 3% on all future construction loans and generally 7% on all development loans which yields a blended margin of approximately 3.9%.\n\u25cf Fee income. Our construction loan fee is 5% on the amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life of each loan. We do not recognize a loan fee on our development loans. When loans terminate before than their expected life, the remaining fee is recognized at the termination of the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 fee income on loans decreased 1% compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in fee income was due primarily to lower loan originations related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf Amount of nonperforming assets. Generally, we can have two types of nonperforming assets that negatively affect interest spread: loans not paying interest and foreclosed assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 29 impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $11,816 and four impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $1,495 that were not paying interest, respectively. Non-performing assets not related to the impact of COVID-19 were $1,229 of the $11,816.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred the loan receivables balance of $9,728 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the amount due from this borrower is $8,206.\nForeclosed assets do not provide a monthly interest return. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, foreclosed assets were $4,449 and $4,916, respectively, which resulted in a negative impact on our interest spread in both years.\nThe amount of nonperforming assets is expected to decrease in the first half of 2021 as we continue to liquidate nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoan Loss Provision\nLoan loss provision (expense throughout the year) was $1,805 and $222 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $1,968, of which $151 is related to loans without specific reserves. The Company recorded specific reserves for loans impaired due to impacts from COVID-19 of $1,532, special mention loans of $120 and impaired loans not due to impacts from COVID-19 of $165. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $72 in direct charge offs.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $235, of which $230 related to loans without specific reserves. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $173 in direct charge-offs.\nNon-Interest Income\nGain on Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $160 and $0 as a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold seven foreclosed assets related to four original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a gain on sale of foreclosed assets.\nGain on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $52 and $203 as a gain on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two and seven loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a gain on foreclosure during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nImpairment Gains on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $91 and $0 as a gain on impairment of foreclosed assets on four certain assets, respectively.\nGain on the Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the PPP Loan\u201d) with LCA Bank Corporation to borrow $361 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. All or a portion of the loan may be forgivable, as provided by the terms of the PPP. During April 2020, the Company received a grant under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance (the EIDL Advance\u201d) which may be used for payroll and other certain operating expenses.\nIn November 2020, the full principal amount of the PPP loan or $361 and the accrued interest were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Interest Expense\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nThe following table displays our SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Board related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent and utilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan and foreclosed asset expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Travel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses decreased $209 to $2,185 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due primarily to lower salaries and related expenses of $412 to $975 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 which were offset by an increase in loan and foreclosed asset expenses of $287.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, salaries and related expenses included profit share expense which was not recognized during 2020. In addition, loan and foreclosed asset expenses were higher in 2020 due to the additions of construction/development costs incurred to fully complete assets to sell. Advertising expenses decreased $43 to $85 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.\nLoss on the Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $102 and $274 as a loss on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold eight foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nLoss on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $54 and $0 as a loss on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a loss on foreclosure during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $445 and $558 as a loss on impairment of foreclosed assets, respectively. Impairment loss on foreclosed assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $91 recognized as a result of COVID-19.\nConsolidated Financial Position\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe try to avoid borrowing on our lines of credit from affiliates. To accomplish this, we must carry some cash for liquidity. This amount generally grows as our Company grows. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $4,749 and $1,883, respectively, in cash.

The Company extinguished the principal balance for the loans on the lots in the amount of $640 and in addition, paid a $500 management fee for the development of homes on certain of the Company's lots that were previously carried as loan receivables.

The initial funding on that interest escrow was $450. The balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $250 and $370, respectively. To the extent the balance is available in the interest escrow, interest due on certain loans is deducted from the interest escrow on the date due. The interest escrow is increased by 20% of lot payoffs on the same loans, and by interest and/or distributions on a loan in which we are the borrower and Investor's Mark Acquisitions, LLC is the lender and on the Series B preferred equity. All of these transactions are noncash to the extent that the total escrow amount does not need additional funding.\nWe had 29 and 19 other loans active as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which also had interest escrows. The cumulative balance of all interest escrows other than the Pennsylvania Loans was $259 and $273 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRoll forward of interest escrow for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Beginning balance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred equity dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Additions from Pennsylvania Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Additions from other loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>768 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest, fees, principal or repaid to borrower </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,837 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,307 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Ending balance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>643 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecured Borrowings\nLoan Purchase and Sale Agreements\nWe have two loan purchase and sale agreements where we are the seller of portions of loans we create. The two purchasers are Builder Finance, Inc. ( Builder Finance\u201d) and S.K. Funding, LLC ( S.K. Funding\u201d). Generally, the purchasers buy between 50% and 75% of each loan sold. They receive interest rates ranging from our cost of funds to the interest rate charged to the borrower (interest rates were between 9% and 13% for both 2020 and 2019). The purchasers generally do not receive any of the loan fees we charge. We have the right to call some of the loans sold, with some restrictions. Once sold, the purchaser must fund their portion of the loans purchased. We service the loans. Also, there are limited put options in some cases, whereby the purchaser can cause us to repurchase a loan. The loan purchase and sale agreements are recorded as secured borrowings.\nIn January 2019, we entered into the Tenth Amendment (the Tenth Amendment\u201d) to our Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement with S.K. Funding. The purpose of the Tenth Amendment was to allow S.K. Funding to purchase a portion of the Pennsylvania Loans.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing of the Company's principal and interest payments to S.K.

As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had combined loans outstanding of 222 and 250, respectively. Gross loans outstanding were $50,449 and $57,608 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unfunded commitments to extend credit, which have similar collateral, credit and market risk to our outstanding loans, were $19,495 and $16,662 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate a significant increase in our gross loan receivables over the 12 months subsequent to December 31, 2020 by directly increasing originations to new and existing customers.\nTo fund our combined loans, we rely on secured debt, unsecured debt, and equity, which are described in the following table:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>Source of Liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of\nDecember 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured debt, net of deferred financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,991 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured debt, net of deferred financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecured debt, net of deferred financing costs decreased $4,032 to $22,959 as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 which consisted of a decrease in borrowings secured by loans and affiliate lines of $3,843 and $189, respectively. We anticipate increasing our secured debt by roughly half of the increase in loan asset balances over the 12 months subsequent to December 31, 2020 through our existing loan purchase and sale agreements and additional lines of credit.\nWe anticipate that the other half of the loan asset growth will come from a combination of decreases in nonperforming assets, many of which are not used as collateral in secured lines, and increases in our unsecured debt and equity. Unsecured debt, net of deferred financing costs increased $458 to $26,978 as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 due primarily to a decrease in other unsecured debts of $717 which was offset by an increased participation in our Notes Program of $1,174.\nEquity decreased $1,888 to $5,259 as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the decline in net income for Class A common equity of $3,011. We anticipate an increase in our equity during the 12 months subsequent to December 31, 2020, through retaining earnings and the issuance of additional Series C cumulative preferred equity ( Series C Preferred Units\u201d). If we are not able to increase our equity through retained earnings or the issuance of additional Series C Preferred Units, we will rely more heavily on raising additional funds through the Notes Program.\nIf we anticipate the ability to not fund our projected increases in loan balances as discussed above, we may reduce new loan originations to reduce need for additional funds.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>52 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows the maturity of outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>Year Maturing </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Amount Maturing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Public Offering </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other Unsecured </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Secured\nBorrowings </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2025 and thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>642 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,968 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total amount maturing through year ending December 31, 2021 is $35,819, which consists of secured borrowings of $22,002 and unsecured borrowings of $13,817.\nSecured borrowings maturing through the year ending December 31, 2021 significantly consists of loan purchase and sale agreements with two loan purchasers (Builder Finance and S. K. Funding) and seven lenders. Our secured borrowings mature by 2021 due primarily to their related demand loan collateral.

To the extent that Notes issued pursuant to the Notes Program are not reinvested upon maturity, we will be required to fund the maturities, which we anticipate funding through the issuance of new Notes in our Notes Program. Historically, approximately 80% of our Note holders reinvest upon maturity. The 36 month Note in our Notes program has a mandatory early redemption option, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2020, the 36 month Notes were $411. Our other unsecured debt has historically renewed. For more information on other unsecured borrowings, see Note 7 - Borrowings. If other unsecured borrowings are not renewed in the future, we anticipate funding such maturities through investments in our Notes Program.\nSummary\nWe have the funding available to address the loans we have today, including our unfunded commitments. We anticipate growing our assets through the net sources and uses (12-month liquidity) listed above as well as future capital increases from debt, redeemable preferred equity, and regular equity. Our expectation to grow loan asset balances is subject to changes due to changes in demand, competition, and COVID-19. Although our secured debt is almost entirely listed as currently due because of the underlying collateral being demand notes, the vast majority of our secured debt is either contractually set to automatically renew unless notice is given or, in the case of purchase and sale agreements, has no end date as to when the purchasers will not purchase new loans (although they are never required to purchase additional loans).\nInflation, Interest Rates, and Housing Starts\nSince we are in the housing industry, we are affected by factors that impact that industry. Housing starts impact our customers' ability to sell their homes. Faster sales mean higher effective interest rates for us, as the recognition of fees we charge is spread over a shorter period. Slower sales mean lower effective interest rates for us. Slower sales are likely to increase the default rate we experience.\nHousing inflation has a positive impact on our operations. When we lend initially, we are lending a percentage of a home's expected value, based on historical sales. If those estimates prove to be low (in an inflationary market), the percentage we loaned of the value actually decreases, reducing potential losses on defaulted loans. The opposite is true in a deflationary housing price market. It is our opinion that values are somewhat above average in many of the housing markets in the U.S. today.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>53 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest rates have several impacts on our business. First, rates affect housing (starts, home size, etc.). High long-term interest rates may decrease housing starts, having the effects listed above. Higher interest rates will also affect our investors. We believe that there will be a spread between the rate our Notes yield to our investors and the rates the same investors could get on deposits at FDIC insured institutions. We also believe that the spread may need to widen if these rates rise. For instance, if we pay 7% above average CD rates when CDs are paying 1.5%, when CDs are paying 3%, we may need a larger than 7% difference. This may cause our lending rates, which are based on our cost of funds, to be uncompetitive. High interest rates may also increase builder defaults, as interest payments may become a higher portion of operating costs for the builder. Below is a chart showing three-year U.S. treasury rates, which are being used by us here to approximate CD rates. Short term interest rates have risen slightly but are generally low historically.\nHousing prices are also generally correlated with housing starts, so that increases in housing starts usually coincide with increases in housing values, and the reverse is generally true. Below is a graph showing single family housing starts from 2000 through today.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>54 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)\nTo date, changes in housing starts, CD rates, and inflation have not had a material impact on our business.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, other than unfunded commitments, we had no off-balance sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements or obligations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of new or recent accounting pronouncements.\nSubsequent Events\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for subsequent events.", "summary": "- Net

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(All dollar [$] amounts shown in thousands.)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOverview\nWe were organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the name 84 RE Partners, LLC and changed our name to Shepherd's Finance, LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. Our business is focused on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market is underserved because of the lack of traditional lenders currently participating in the market. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Our operations are governed pursuant to our limited liability company agreement.\nThe commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In some circumstances, the lot is purchased with an older home on the lot which is then either removed or rehabilitated. If the home is rehabilitated, the loan is referred to as a rehab\u201d loan. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of lots and undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position and the opportunities available to us, do none, any or all of the following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate or other collateral), purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we will operate our business.\nEconomic and Industry Dynamics\nThe Company has been impacted by and continues to face risks related to COVID-19, which has caused disruptions to the economy and in all of the markets in which the Company lends. The Company's operating results depend significantly on the homebuilding industry.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company had 46 loans at a gross loans receivable balance of $12,993 of impaired loans primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,492 in loan loss expense and $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's number of impaired loans reduced by 17 loans to 29 compared to the 46 impaired loans as of June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the 29 impaired gross loans receivable balance was $11,816 which was primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,533 in loan loss expense, $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets and $469 in direct write-offs of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company continues to lose interest income on assets that do not accrue interest. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the estimated loss on interest income related to impaired and foreclosed assets was $1,150. Looking ahead, we expect this to decrease in the first half of 2021.\nFinally, the impact of COVID-19 and prior to COVID-19 is the lack of loan originations which impacts our earnings through the loss of fee income. Loan originations and fee income for the first five months of 2020 and 2019 was $11,166 and $886 and $30,605 and $1,411, respectively. For the last seven months of 2020, loan originations increased to $42,390 compared to $28,165 for the same period of 2019. We anticipate this rate of increase to continue through 2021.\n 30 \n \nResponse to COVID-19\nAs a result of the potential impact of COVID-19, we suspended originations of new loans as of March 20, 2020 in order to maintain our liquidity and based on our expectation that home values would likely decrease in the near future. We initially told all of our borrowers that we will fund all loans where the underlying home is already under construction, and advised them to build as quickly as possible to bring the homes on the market as soon as possible. For loans where the borrower has not yet begun construction of the underlying home, we initially told them that we would not fund construction and they should therefore not start construction.\nDuring April 2020, as the Company continued to monitor market conditions overall and in the specific markets in which the Company lends, the Company observed that some markets had little to no impact from a housing perspective as a result of COVID-19; however, the Company's borrowers in Pennsylvania and Michigan were significantly impacted due to the government shutting down home construction completely, and customers in Florida were significantly impacted by the changes in lending rules for end users and the high levels of unemployment caused by COVID-19. The Company made the decision to fund new loans to borrowers in stronger markets for the purpose of developing presold homes, which loans have reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company continued to monitor funding spec loans in some markets on a case-by-case basis for loans with reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company stopped recognizing interest on loans issued to customers impacted by COVID-19 and is expected to continue until those loans are paid off.\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company made the decision to reopen lending under normal, pre-COVID-19 terms for a limited group of certain of its customers. In addition, the decision was made to allow rehab loans to builders at terms that are less conservative than those established in April 2020 but more conservative than terms prior to the arrival of COVID-19. At that point, the Company was offering normal terms to approximately 40% of its customers, and restricted terms to approximately 60% of its customers. In the second half of 2020, the Company slowly increased the percentage of customers with normal terms to near 100% by the end of the year. The Company averaged $2,233 in new loan originations in the first five months of 2020, but under the adjusted terms the Company averaged $6,056 of loan originations in June through December 2020. The fees from these originations are typically recognized over 12 months. New loan fees from these seven months before deferred loan origination costs were $1,849, which we will recognize over 12 months. The Company attributes this increase in volume to many of its larger nonbank competitors going out of business or leaving the lending business. In the second and third quarters, all builders who we told not to build on lots we had closed on in the first quarter were allowed to build the homes. All but five of those homes has started construction, and many are finished and paid off.\nWe are continuously monitoring the markets, builders, and the COVID-19 situation for the remaining loans which we have not yet released for construction. Management anticipates revisiting these lending parameters during 2021 as the COVID-19 situation continues to develop. However, due to the continued cases of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still economic uncertainties that could negatively impact net income (loss). Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.\n 31 \n \nPerceived Challenges and Anticipated Responses\nThe following is not intended to represent a comprehensive list or description of the risks or challenges facing the Company. Currently, our management is most focused on the following challenges along with the corresponding actions to address those challenges:\n Perceived Challenges and Risks Anticipated Management Actions/Response Potential loan value-to-collateral value issues (i.e., being underwater on particular loans) We manage this challenge by risk-rating both the geographic region and the builder, and then adjusting the loan-to-value (i.e., the loan amount versus the value of the collateral) based on risk assessments. Additionally, we collect a deposit up-front for construction loans. Despite these efforts, if values in a particular area of the country drop by 60%, we will have loaned more than the value of the collateral. We have found that the best solution to this risk is a speedy resolution of the loan, and helping the builder finish the home rapidly rather than foreclosing on the partially built home. Our experience in this area will help us limit, but not eliminate, the negative effects in the event of another economic downturn. Concentration of loan portfolio (i.e., how many of the loans are of or with any particular type, customer, or geography) As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 29% and 25% of our outstanding loan commitments consist of loans to one borrower, and the collateral is in one real estate market, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a significant portion of these loans is susceptible to changes in market conditions in that area. As of December 31, 2020, our next two largest customers make up 12% and 6% of our loan commitments, with loans in Orlando, Florida and Cape Coral, Florida, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, our next two largest customers made up 15% and 3% of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Savannah, Georgia, respectively. In the upcoming years, we plan on continuing to increase our geographic and builder diversity while continuing to focus on our residential homebuilder customers. Not having funds available to us to service the commitments we have As of December 31, 2020, our typical construction loan had about 68% of its loan amount outstanding on average. That means that on average, about 32% of the commitment is not loaned, usually because the house is not complete. As of December 31, 2020, unfunded commitments totaled $19,495, which we will fund along with our purchase and sale agreement participants. However, if we are short on cash, we could do the following: \u25cf raise interest rates on the Notes we offer to our investors to attract new Note investments; \u25cf sell more secured interest on our loans; or \u25cf draw down on our lines of credit from our affiliates. Nonpayment of interest by our customers Most of our customers pay interest on a monthly basis, and these funds are used to, among other things, pay interest on our debt monthly. While we have the liquidity to withstand some nonpayment of interest, if a high percentage of our customers were not paying interest, it will impede our ability to pay our debts on time. Nonperforming assets As of December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets were approximately $14,568 (defined as impaired loans and/or loans on nonaccrual plus foreclosed assets net of reserves). \nOpportunities\nThe Company anticipates an increase in profit in 2021 compared to 2020. To achieve these increases in profits, the Company is focused on the following four things:\n 1. First, the Company is focused on reducing the number of assets currently not paying interest. Due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred 31 loans with a total loan receivable, net balance of $8,687 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the total loans for this certain borrower classified as impaired assets decreased by 15 to 16 with a total loan receivable, net balance of $6,906. The Company's reduction of non-performing assets are expected to be achieved by a combination of the selling of foreclosed assets and the payoff of nonperforming loans; 2. Second, the Company is focused on continuing the higher level of new loan originations that the Company did not realize during the first five months of 2020. Average originations during the first five months and last seven months ended December 31, 2020 was $2,233 and $6,056, respectively; \n 32 \n \n\nWe anticipate that the housing market in most of the areas in which we do business will be strong despite the impact of COVID-19. We also anticipate that the losses we incurred in principal related to COVID-19 will not continue, and that the lack of interest due to nonperforming assets from COVID-19 will decrease significantly over the course of the first half of 2021.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTo assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nLoan Losses\nFuture losses on current loans are estimated in our financial statements. This estimate is important because it is on our largest asset (loans receivable). It is impossible to know what these losses will be, as the condition of the market cannot be determined, and specific situations with each loan are unpredictable and change constantly. Loan losses, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the number of losses to capture during the current year. This current period amount incurred is referred to as the loan loss provision. The calculation of our allowance for loan losses, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to Loans receivable, net and is detailed in the notes to our financial statements, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the number of probable losses inherent in our commercial lending operations and to reflect that estimated risk in our allowance calculations. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nWe establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of each quarter. This collective reserve includes both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. In addition to historical loss information, the analysis incorporates collateral value, decisions made by management and staff, percentage of aging spec loans, policies, procedures, and economic conditions.\nWe individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past are due at the end of each quarter. We also review for impairment all loans to one borrower with greater than or equal to 10% of our total committed balances. If required, the analysis includes a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan.\nFor impaired loans, if the value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and some loans may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed basis and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.\nFor loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last 13 months if construction is greater than 90% complete. If construction is less than 90% complete the Company uses the latest appraisal on file. Certain times the Company may choose to use a broker's opinions of value ( BOV\u201d) as a replacement for an appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal. Broker's opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker's opinion of value.\n 33 \n \nAppraisers are state certified, and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent who works in that geographic area.\nCurrently, fair value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision. Specifically, relevant to the allowance for loan loss reserve is the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances. Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Due to a rapidly changing economic market, an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be used to develop fair value estimates, and the various assumptions that could be used, determining the collateral's fair value requires significant judgment.\n\n* Increases in the fair value of the real estate collateral do not impact the loan loss provision, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d\n** If the loans were nonperforming, assuming a book amount of the loans outstanding of $46,405, and the fair value of the real estate collateral on all outstanding loans was reduced by 35%.\nForeclosed Assets\nForeclosed assets, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the amount of impairment to capture when a loan is converted to a foreclosed asset, the impairment when the value of an asset drops below the carrying amount, and any loss or gain upon final disposition of the asset. The calculation of the impairment, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the asset, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the value of the asset and therefore any required impairment thereof. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nFor properties which exist in the condition in which we intend to sell them, we obtain an appraisal of the assets current value. We reduce the appraised value by 10% to account for estimated selling costs. This amount is used to initially book the asset. Typically, prior to the initial booking of the foreclosed asset, the loan has already been reserved to this level. If during ownership, the value of the foreclosed asset drops, an additional impairment is recorded. For assets that need to be improved prior to sale, we adjust the portion of the appraised value related to construction improvements for the percentage of the improvements which have not yet been made.\n 34 \n \nThe fair value of real estate will impact our foreclosed asset value, which is recorded at 100% of fair value (after selling costs are deducted). Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\n\n* Increases in the fair value of the foreclosed assets do not impact the carrying value, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d Those gains would be recognized at the sale of the asset. However, the increase in fair value may be recognized up to the cost basis of the foreclosed asset which was determined at the foreclosure date.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as courts, arbitrators, juries, or regulators.\nAccounting and Auditing Standards Applicable to Emerging Growth Companies\u201d\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company,\u201d we are not required to: (1) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (2) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer or (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period discussed in (4), and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOther significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Policies related to credit quality information, fair value measurements, offsetting assets and liabilities, related party transactions and revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple and recent changes in the authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination or have recently been addressed by accounting standard setters and regulators. Specific conclusions have not been reached by these standard setters, and outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, as they discuss accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nKey financial and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below. For a more complete understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and the other information contained in this document.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require that we report financial and descriptive information about reportable segments and how these segments were determined. Our management determines the allocation and performance of resources based on operating income, net income and operating cash flows. Segments are identified and aggregated based on the products sold or services provided and the market(s) they serve. Based on these factors, management has determined that our ongoing operations are in one segment, commercial lending.\n 35 \n \nBelow is a summary of our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nNet (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $2,943 to $(1,929) when compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the economic effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, we had $46,405 and $55,369 in loan assets, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had 213 construction loans in 21 states with 67 borrowers and nine development loans in five states with eight borrowers.\n 36 \n \nInterest Spread\nThe following table displays a comparison of our interest income, expense, fees and spread for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n*annualized amount as percentage of weighted average outstanding gross loan balance\nThere are three main components that can impact our interest spread:\n\u25cf Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings). The loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum cost of funds of 7%. For most loans, the margin is fixed at 3%; however, for our development loans the margin is generally fixed at 7%. This component is also impacted by the lending of money with no interest cost (our equity).\nInterest income on loans decreased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 14% for the same periods of 2019. The Company expensed $469 in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to impairment of loans associated with four of our borrowers directly related to COVID-19. In addition, estimated interest not earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to those borrowers was approximately $1,099.\nThe difference between estimated interest income on loans ignoring the impact of COVID-19 and the interest paid was 3% for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 which is our standard margin.\nWe anticipate our standard margin to be 3% on all future construction loans and generally 7% on all development loans which yields a blended margin of approximately 3.9%.\n\u25cf Fee income. Our construction loan fee is 5% on the amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life of each loan. We do not recognize a loan fee on our development loans. When loans terminate before than their expected life, the remaining fee is recognized at the termination of the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 fee income on loans decreased 1% compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in fee income was due primarily to lower loan originations related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf Amount of nonperforming assets. Generally, we can have two types of nonperforming assets that negatively affect interest spread: loans not paying interest and foreclosed assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 29 impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $11,816 and four impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $1,495 that were not paying interest, respectively. Non-performing assets not related to the impact of COVID-19 were $1,229 of the $11,816.\n 37 \n \nDue to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred the loan receivables balance of $9,728 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the amount due from this borrower is $8,206.\nForeclosed assets do not provide a monthly interest return. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, foreclosed assets were $4,449 and $4,916, respectively, which resulted in a negative impact on our interest spread in both years.\nThe amount of nonperforming assets is expected to decrease in the first half of 2021 as we continue to liquidate nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoan Loss Provision\nLoan loss provision (expense throughout the year) was $1,805 and $222 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $1,968, of which $151 is related to loans without specific reserves. The Company recorded specific reserves for loans impaired due to impacts from COVID-19 of $1,532, special mention loans of $120 and impaired loans not due to impacts from COVID-19 of $165. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $72 in direct charge offs.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $235, of which $230 related to loans without specific reserves. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $173 in direct charge-offs.\nNon-Interest Income\nGain on Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $160 and $0 as a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold seven foreclosed assets related to four original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a gain on sale of foreclosed assets.\nGain on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $52 and $203 as a gain on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two and seven loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a gain on foreclosure during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nImpairment Gains on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $91 and $0 as a gain on impairment of foreclosed assets on four certain assets, respectively.\nGain on the Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the PPP Loan\u201d) with LCA Bank Corporation to borrow $361 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. All or a portion of the loan may be forgivable, as provided by the terms of the PPP. During April 2020, the Company received a grant under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance (the EIDL Advance\u201d) which may be used for payroll and other certain operating expenses.\nIn November 2020, the full principal amount of the PPP loan or $361 and the accrued interest were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n 38 \n \nNon-Interest Expense\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nThe following table displays our SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nSG&A expenses decreased $209 to $2,185 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due primarily to lower salaries and related expenses of $412 to $975 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 which were offset by an increase in loan and foreclosed asset expenses of $287.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, salaries and related expenses included profit share expense which was not recognized during 2020. In addition, loan and foreclosed asset expenses were higher in 2020 due to the additions of construction/development costs incurred to fully complete assets to sell. Advertising expenses decreased $43 to $85 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.\nLoss on the Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $102 and $274 as a loss on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold eight foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nLoss on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $54 and $0 as a loss on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a loss on foreclosure during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $445 and $558 as a loss on impairment of foreclosed assets, respectively. Impairment loss on foreclosed assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $91 recognized as a result of COVID-19.\nConsolidated Financial Position\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe try to avoid borrowing on our lines of credit from affiliates. To accomplish this, we must carry some cash for liquidity. This amount generally grows as our Company grows. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $4,749 and $1,883, respectively, in cash. See our Liquidity and Capital Resources section for more information.\n 39 \n \nLoans Receivable\nCommercial Loans - Construction Loan Portfolio Summary\nThe following is a summary of our loan portfolio to builders for home construction loans as of December 31, 2020:\n\n\n 40 \n \nThe following is a summary of our loan portfolio to builders for home construction loans as of December 31, 2019:\n\n\nCommercial Loans - Real Estate Development Loan Portfolio Summary\nThe following is a summary of our loan portfolio to builders for land development as of December 31, 2020:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(All dollar [$] amounts shown in thousands.)\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nOverview\nWe were organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the name 84 RE Partners, LLC and changed our name to Shepherd's Finance, LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. Our business is focused on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market is underserved because of the lack of traditional lenders currently participating in the market. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Our operations are governed pursuant to our limited liability company agreement.\nThe commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In some circumstances, the lot is purchased with an older home on the lot which is then either removed or rehabilitated. If the home is rehabilitated, the loan is referred to as a rehab\u201d loan. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of lots and undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position and the opportunities available to us, do none, any or all of the following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate or other collateral), purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we will operate our business.\nEconomic and Industry Dynamics\nThe Company has been impacted by and continues to face risks related to COVID-19, which has caused disruptions to the economy and in all of the markets in which the Company lends. The Company's operating results depend significantly on the homebuilding industry.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company had 46 loans at a gross loans receivable balance of $12,993 of impaired loans primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,492 in loan loss expense and $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's number of impaired loans reduced by 17 loans to 29 compared to the 46 impaired loans as of June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the 29 impaired gross loans receivable balance was $11,816 which was primarily due to COVID-19. In addition, we recognized $1,533 in loan loss expense, $91 in impairment loss of foreclosed assets and $469 in direct write-offs of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company continues to lose interest income on assets that do not accrue interest. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the estimated loss on interest income related to impaired and foreclosed assets was $1,150. Looking ahead, we expect this to decrease in the first half of 2021.\nFinally, the impact of COVID-19 and prior to COVID-19 is the lack of loan originations which impacts our earnings through the loss of fee income. Loan originations and fee income for the first five months of 2020 and 2019 was $11,166 and $886 and $30,605 and $1,411, respectively. For the last seven months of 2020, loan originations increased to $42,390 compared to $28,165 for the same period of 2019. We anticipate this rate of increase to continue through 2021.\n 30 \n \nResponse to COVID-19\nAs a result of the potential impact of COVID-19, we suspended originations of new loans as of March 20, 2020 in order to maintain our liquidity and based on our expectation that home values would likely decrease in the near future. We initially told all of our borrowers that we will fund all loans where the underlying home is already under construction, and advised them to build as quickly as possible to bring the homes on the market as soon as possible. For loans where the borrower has not yet begun construction of the underlying home, we initially told them that we would not fund construction and they should therefore not start construction.\nDuring April 2020, as the Company continued to monitor market conditions overall and in the specific markets in which the Company lends, the Company observed that some markets had little to no impact from a housing perspective as a result of COVID-19; however, the Company's borrowers in Pennsylvania and Michigan were significantly impacted due to the government shutting down home construction completely, and customers in Florida were significantly impacted by the changes in lending rules for end users and the high levels of unemployment caused by COVID-19. The Company made the decision to fund new loans to borrowers in stronger markets for the purpose of developing presold homes, which loans have reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company continued to monitor funding spec loans in some markets on a case-by-case basis for loans with reduced loan-to-value ratios. In addition, the Company stopped recognizing interest on loans issued to customers impacted by COVID-19 and is expected to continue until those loans are paid off.\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company made the decision to reopen lending under normal, pre-COVID-19 terms for a limited group of certain of its customers. In addition, the decision was made to allow rehab loans to builders at terms that are less conservative than those established in April 2020 but more conservative than terms prior to the arrival of COVID-19. At that point, the Company was offering normal terms to approximately 40% of its customers, and restricted terms to approximately 60% of its customers. In the second half of 2020, the Company slowly increased the percentage of customers with normal terms to near 100% by the end of the year. The Company averaged $2,233 in new loan originations in the first five months of 2020, but under the adjusted terms the Company averaged $6,056 of loan originations in June through December 2020. The fees from these originations are typically recognized over 12 months. New loan fees from these seven months before deferred loan origination costs were $1,849, which we will recognize over 12 months. The Company attributes this increase in volume to many of its larger nonbank competitors going out of business or leaving the lending business. In the second and third quarters, all builders who we told not to build on lots we had closed on in the first quarter were allowed to build the homes. All but five of those homes has started construction, and many are finished and paid off.\nWe are continuously monitoring the markets, builders, and the COVID-19 situation for the remaining loans which we have not yet released for construction. Management anticipates revisiting these lending parameters during 2021 as the COVID-19 situation continues to develop. However, due to the continued cases of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still economic uncertainties that could negatively impact net income (loss). Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.\n 31 \n \nPerceived Challenges and Anticipated Responses\nThe following is not intended to represent a comprehensive list or description of the risks or challenges facing the Company. Currently, our management is most focused on the following challenges along with the corresponding actions to address those challenges:\n Perceived Challenges and Risks Anticipated Management Actions/Response Potential loan value-to-collateral value issues (i.e., being underwater on particular loans) We manage this challenge by risk-rating both the geographic region and the builder, and then adjusting the loan-to-value (i.e., the loan amount versus the value of the collateral) based on risk assessments. Additionally, we collect a deposit up-front for construction loans. Despite these efforts, if values in a particular area of the country drop by 60%, we will have loaned more than the value of the collateral. We have found that the best solution to this risk is a speedy resolution of the loan, and helping the builder finish the home rapidly rather than foreclosing on the partially built home. Our experience in this area will help us limit, but not eliminate, the negative effects in the event of another economic downturn. Concentration of loan portfolio (i.e., how many of the loans are of or with any particular type, customer, or geography) As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 29% and 25% of our outstanding loan commitments consist of loans to one borrower, and the collateral is in one real estate market, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a significant portion of these loans is susceptible to changes in market conditions in that area. As of December 31, 2020, our next two largest customers make up 12% and 6% of our loan commitments, with loans in Orlando, Florida and Cape Coral, Florida, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, our next two largest customers made up 15% and 3% of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Savannah, Georgia, respectively. In the upcoming years, we plan on continuing to increase our geographic and builder diversity while continuing to focus on our residential homebuilder customers. Not having funds available to us to service the commitments we have As of December 31, 2020, our typical construction loan had about 68% of its loan amount outstanding on average. That means that on average, about 32% of the commitment is not loaned, usually because the house is not complete. As of December 31, 2020, unfunded commitments totaled $19,495, which we will fund along with our purchase and sale agreement participants. However, if we are short on cash, we could do the following: \u25cf raise interest rates on the Notes we offer to our investors to attract new Note investments; \u25cf sell more secured interest on our loans; or \u25cf draw down on our lines of credit from our affiliates. Nonpayment of interest by our customers Most of our customers pay interest on a monthly basis, and these funds are used to, among other things, pay interest on our debt monthly. While we have the liquidity to withstand some nonpayment of interest, if a high percentage of our customers were not paying interest, it will impede our ability to pay our debts on time. Nonperforming assets As of December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets were approximately $14,568 (defined as impaired loans and/or loans on nonaccrual plus foreclosed assets net of reserves). \nOpportunities\nThe Company anticipates an increase in profit in 2021 compared to 2020. To achieve these increases in profits, the Company is focused on the following four things:\n 1. First, the Company is focused on reducing the number of assets currently not paying interest. Due primarily to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred 31 loans with a total loan receivable, net balance of $8,687 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the total loans for this certain borrower classified as impaired assets decreased by 15 to 16 with a total loan receivable, net balance of $6,906. The Company's reduction of non-performing assets are expected to be achieved by a combination of the selling of foreclosed assets and the payoff of nonperforming loans; 2. Second, the Company is focused on continuing the higher level of new loan originations that the Company did not realize during the first five months of 2020. Average originations during the first five months and last seven months ended December 31, 2020 was $2,233 and $6,056, respectively; \n 32 \n \nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>3. </td> <td>Third, the Company seeks to have the cash to fund new originations through new financing and the potential reduction of nonperforming assets;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>4. </td> <td>Fourth, lowering the Company's cost of funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that the housing market in most of the areas in which we do business will be strong despite the impact of COVID-19. We also anticipate that the losses we incurred in principal related to COVID-19 will not continue, and that the lack of interest due to nonperforming assets from COVID-19 will decrease significantly over the course of the first half of 2021.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTo assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nLoan Losses\nFuture losses on current loans are estimated in our financial statements. This estimate is important because it is on our largest asset (loans receivable). It is impossible to know what these losses will be, as the condition of the market cannot be determined, and specific situations with each loan are unpredictable and change constantly. Loan losses, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the number of losses to capture during the current year. This current period amount incurred is referred to as the loan loss provision. The calculation of our allowance for loan losses, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to Loans receivable, net and is detailed in the notes to our financial statements, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the number of probable losses inherent in our commercial lending operations and to reflect that estimated risk in our allowance calculations. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nWe establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of each quarter. This collective reserve includes both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. In addition to historical loss information, the analysis incorporates collateral value, decisions made by management and staff, percentage of aging spec loans, policies, procedures, and economic conditions.\nWe individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past are due at the end of each quarter. We also review for impairment all loans to one borrower with greater than or equal to 10% of our total committed balances. If required, the analysis includes a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan.\nFor impaired loans, if the value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and some loans may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed basis and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.\nFor loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last 13 months if construction is greater than 90% complete. If construction is less than 90% complete the Company uses the latest appraisal on file. Certain times the Company may choose to use a broker's opinions of value ( BOV\u201d) as a replacement for an appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal. Broker's opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker's opinion of value.\n 33 \n \nAppraisers are state certified, and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent who works in that geographic area.\nCurrently, fair value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision. Specifically, relevant to the allowance for loan loss reserve is the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances. Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Due to a rapidly changing economic market, an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be used to develop fair value estimates, and the various assumptions that could be used, determining the collateral's fair value requires significant judgment.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\nLoan Loss\nProvision\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Fair Value Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>Higher/(Lower) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35%* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Decreasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35%** </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Increases in the fair value of the real estate collateral do not impact the loan loss provision, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d\n** If the loans were nonperforming, assuming a book amount of the loans outstanding of $46,405, and the fair value of the real estate collateral on all outstanding loans was reduced by 35%.\nForeclosed Assets\nForeclosed assets, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the amount of impairment to capture when a loan is converted to a foreclosed asset, the impairment when the value of an asset drops below the carrying amount, and any loss or gain upon final disposition of the asset. The calculation of the impairment, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the asset, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the value of the asset and therefore any required impairment thereof. We use the policy summarized as follows:\nFor properties which exist in the condition in which we intend to sell them, we obtain an appraisal of the assets current value. We reduce the appraised value by 10% to account for estimated selling costs. This amount is used to initially book the asset. Typically, prior to the initial booking of the foreclosed asset, the loan has already been reserved to this level. If during ownership, the value of the foreclosed asset drops, an additional impairment is recorded. For assets that need to be improved prior to sale, we adjust the portion of the appraised value related to construction improvements for the percentage of the improvements which have not yet been made.\n 34 \n \nThe fair value of real estate will impact our foreclosed asset value, which is recorded at 100% of fair value (after selling costs are deducted). Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020\nForeclosed Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Fair Value Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>Higher/(Lower) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Increasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35%* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Decreasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Increases in the fair value of the foreclosed assets do not impact the carrying value, as the value generally is not written up.\u201d Those gains would be recognized at the sale of the asset. However, the increase in fair value may be recognized up to the cost basis of the foreclosed asset which was determined at the foreclosure date.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as courts, arbitrators, juries, or regulators.\nAccounting and Auditing Standards Applicable to Emerging Growth Companies\u201d\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company,\u201d we are not required to: (1) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (2) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer or (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period discussed in (4), and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOther significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Policies related to credit quality information, fair value measurements, offsetting assets and liabilities, related party transactions and revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple and recent changes in the authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination or have recently been addressed by accounting standard setters and regulators. Specific conclusions have not been reached by these standard setters, and outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, as they discuss accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nKey financial and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below. For a more complete understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and the other information contained in this document.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require that we report financial and descriptive information about reportable segments and how these segments were determined. Our management determines the allocation and performance of resources based on operating income, net income and operating cash flows. Segments are identified and aggregated based on the products sold or services provided and the market(s) they serve. Based on these factors, management has determined that our ongoing operations are in one segment, commercial lending.\n 35 \n \nBelow is a summary of our statement of operations for the years ended

The decrease in net income was primarily due to the economic effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, we had $46,405 and $55,369 in loan assets, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had 213 construction loans in 21 states with 67 borrowers and nine development loans in five states with eight borrowers.\n 36 \n \nInterest Spread\nThe following table displays a comparison of our interest income, expense, fees and spread for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated unearned interest income due to COVID-19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,099 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write-offs due to COVID-19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(469 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fee income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and fee income on loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - secured </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - unsecured </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Offering costs amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,7580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income (spread) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average outstanding loan asset balance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*annualized amount as percentage of weighted average outstanding gross loan balance\nThere are three main components that can impact our interest spread:\n\u25cf Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings). The loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum cost of funds of 7%. For most loans, the margin is fixed at 3%; however, for our development loans the margin is generally fixed at 7%. This component is also impacted by the lending of money with no interest cost (our equity).\nInterest income on loans decreased to 11% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 14% for the same periods of 2019. The Company expensed $469 in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to impairment of loans associated with four of our borrowers directly related to COVID-19. In addition, estimated interest not earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to those borrowers was approximately $1,099.\nThe difference between estimated interest income on loans ignoring the impact of COVID-19 and the interest paid was 3% for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 which is our standard margin.\nWe anticipate our standard margin to be 3% on all future construction loans and generally 7% on all development loans which yields a blended margin of approximately 3.9%.\n\u25cf Fee income. Our construction loan fee is 5% on the amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life of each loan. We do not recognize a loan fee on our development loans. When loans terminate before than their expected life, the remaining fee is recognized at the termination of the loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 fee income on loans decreased 1% compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in fee income was due primarily to lower loan originations related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf Amount of nonperforming assets. Generally, we can have two types of nonperforming assets that negatively affect interest spread: loans not paying interest and foreclosed assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 29 impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $11,816 and four impaired loans in the aggregate amount of $1,495 that were not paying interest, respectively. Non-performing assets not related to the impact of COVID-19 were $1,229 of the $11,816.\n 37 \n \nDue to the impact of COVID-19, the Company transferred the loan receivables balance of $9,728 as of June 30, 2020 for one of our largest borrowers into a non-performing asset. As of December 31, 2020, the amount due from this borrower is $8,206.\nForeclosed assets do not provide a monthly interest return. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, foreclosed assets were $4,449 and $4,916, respectively, which resulted in a negative impact on our interest spread in both years.\nThe amount of nonperforming assets is expected to decrease in the first half of 2021 as we continue to liquidate nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets.\nLoan Loss Provision\nLoan loss provision (expense throughout the year) was $1,805 and $222 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $1,968, of which $151 is related to loans without specific reserves. The Company recorded specific reserves for loans impaired due to impacts from COVID-19 of $1,532, special mention loans of $120 and impaired loans not due to impacts from COVID-19 of $165. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $72 in direct charge offs.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $235, of which $230 related to loans without specific reserves. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $173 in direct charge-offs.\nNon-Interest Income\nGain on Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $160 and $0 as a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold seven foreclosed assets related to four original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a gain on sale of foreclosed assets.\nGain on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $52 and $203 as a gain on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two and seven loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a gain on foreclosure during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nImpairment Gains on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $91 and $0 as a gain on impairment of foreclosed assets on four certain assets, respectively.\nGain on the Extinguishment of Debt\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the PPP Loan\u201d) with LCA Bank Corporation to borrow $361 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. All or a portion of the loan may be forgivable, as provided by the terms of the PPP. During April 2020, the Company received a grant under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance (the EIDL Advance\u201d) which may be used for payroll and other certain operating expenses.\nIn November 2020, the full principal amount of the PPP loan or $361 and the accrued interest were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n 38 \n \nNon-Interest Expense\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nThe following table displays our SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Board related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent and utilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan and foreclosed asset expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Travel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses decreased $209 to $2,185 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due primarily to lower salaries and related expenses of $412 to $975 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 which were offset by an increase in loan and foreclosed asset expenses of $287.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, salaries and related expenses included profit share expense which was not recognized during 2020. In addition, loan and foreclosed asset expenses were higher in 2020 due to the additions of construction/development costs incurred to fully complete assets to sell. Advertising expenses decreased $43 to $85 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.\nLoss on the Sale of Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $102 and $274 as a loss on the sale of foreclosed assets. We sold eight foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers during the year ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three foreclosed assets related to two original borrowers which resulted in a loss on sale of foreclosed assets.\nLoss on Foreclosure of Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $54 and $0 as a loss on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred two loan receivable assets to foreclosed assets which resulted in a loss on foreclosure during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss on Foreclosed Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $445 and $558 as a loss on impairment of foreclosed assets, respectively. Impairment loss on foreclosed assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $91 recognized as a result of COVID-19.\nConsolidated Financial Position\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe try to avoid borrowing on our lines of credit from affiliates. To accomplish this, we must carry some cash for liquidity. This amount generally grows as our Company grows. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $4,749 and $1,883, respectively, in cash.
